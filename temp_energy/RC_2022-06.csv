it's pretty common for oil to lead in a commodities supercycle, which is a pattern that others have noted long before me. it's something i have been harping on for the last few months, ""watch for oil decoupling first"", while we were all crashing together. it's a trend i have noticed across many cycles post-wwii, but when asked for the receipts i didn't have any good charts on hand.

that's why you're getting 2004 rather than say, 1986 or 1970 which i think are better examples of this phenomenon, and more similar macro environments overall to what we are currently in. because 2004 has the most visible, accessible data on tradingview and the recency has some advantages too such as having *similar* demographics, inflationary pressures, and deflationary pressures.",5,,TaxLandNotCapital,0

&gt; 
&gt; houston/washington, june 5 (reuters) - italian oil company eni spa and spain's repsol sa could begin shipping venezuelan oil to europe as soon as next month to make up for russian crude, five people familiar with the matter said, resuming oil-for-debt swaps halted two years ago when washington stepped up sanctions on venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; the volume of oil eni and repsol are expected to receive is not large, one of the people said, and any impact on global oil prices will be modest. but washington's greenlight to resume venezuela's long-frozen oil flows to europe could provide a symbolic boost for venezuelan president nicolas maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; the u.s. state department gave the nod to the two companies to resume shipments in a letter, the people said. u.s. president joe biden's administration hopes the venezuelan crude can help europe cut dependence on russia and re-direct some of venezuela's cargoes from china. coaxing maduro into restarting political talks with venezuela's opposition is another aim, two of the people told reuters.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; the two european energy companies, which have joint ventures with venezuelan state-run oil company pdvsa, can count the crude cargoes toward unpaid debts and late dividends, the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; a key condition, one of the people said, was that the oil received ""has to go to europe. it cannot be resold elsewhere.""
&gt; 
&gt; washington believes pdvsa will not benefit financially from these cash-free transactions, unlike venezuela‚Äôs current oil sales to china, that person said. china has not signed onto western sanctions on russia, and has continued to buy russian oil and gas despite u.s. appeals.
&gt; 
&gt; the authorizations came last month, but details and resale restrictions have not been reported previously.
&gt; 
&gt; eni [(eni.mi)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/eni.mi)declined comment, citing a policy of not commenting ""on issues of potential commercial sensitivity."" repsol [(rep.mc)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/rep.mc) did not reply to requests for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; ## others excluded
&gt; 
&gt; washington has not made similar allowances for u.s. oil major chevron corp[(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n), india's oil and natural gas corp ltd (ongc) [(ongc.ns)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ongc.ns) and france's maurel &amp; prom sa[(maup.pa)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/maup.pa), which also lobbied the u.s. state department and u.s. treasury department to take oil in return for billions of dollars in accumulated debts from venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; all five oil companies halted swapping oil for debt in mid-2020 in the midst of former u.s. president donald trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign that cut venezuela's oil exports but failed to oust maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; pdvsa has not scheduled eni and repsol to take any cargoes this month, according to a june 3 preliminary pdvsa loading program seen by reuters.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela vice president delcy rodriguez tweeted last month she hoped the u.s. overtures ""will pave the way for the total lifting of the illegal sanctions which affect our entire people.""
&gt; 
&gt; ## outreach to caracas
&gt; 
&gt; the biden administration held its highest level talks with caracas in march, and venezuela freed two of at least 10 jailed u.s. citizens and promised to resume election talks with the opposition. maduro has yet to agree on a date to return to the negotiating table. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-opposes-norway-facilitator-political-talks-with-opposition-2022-05-25/)
&gt; 
&gt; republican lawmakers and some of biden‚Äôs fellow democrats who oppose any softening of u.s. policy toward maduro have blasted the u.s. approach to venezuela as too one-sided.
&gt; 
&gt; washington maintains further sanctions relief on venezuela will be conditioned on progress toward democratic change as maduro negotiates with the opposition.
&gt; 
&gt; last month, the biden administration authorized chevron, the largest u.s. oil company still operating in venezuela, to talk to maduro‚Äôs government and pdvsa about future operations in venezuela. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/talks-between-venezuelas-maduro-opposition-expected-us-easing-some-restrictions-2022-05-17/)
&gt; 
&gt; about that time, the u.s. state department secretly sent letters to eni and repsol saying washington would ‚Äúnot object‚Äù if they resumed oil-for-debt deals and brought the oil to europe, one of the sources told reuters.
&gt; 
&gt; the letters assured them they would face no penalties for taking venezuelan oil cargoes to collect on pending debt, said two people in washington.
&gt; 
&gt; ## chevon consideration
&gt; 
&gt; chevron's request to the u.s. treasury to expand its operations in venezuela came as the state department issued the no-objection letters to eni and repsol. the person familiar with the matter in washington declined to say whether chevron's request remained under consideration.
&gt; 
&gt; the u.s. oil major did receive a six-month continuation of a license that preserves its assets and u.s. approval to talk with venezuelan government officials about future operations. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-renews-chevrons-venezuela-license-through-nov-under-same-restrictions-2022-05-27/)
&gt; 
&gt; it was not immediately clear if washington had okayed the prior crude-for-fuel swaps european companies conducted with pdvsa until 2020, exchanges that provided relief to gasoline-thirsty venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; china has become the largest customer for venezuelan oil, with as much as 70% of monthly shipments destined for its refiners. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-oil-exports-fall-8-april-amid-quality-linked-delays-data-2022-05-05/)

1654522089,"your head is in the right spot but i think you need to take your blinders off of f.  by all definitions, f is in a downtrend and so is the market, and to add to that, f is also weaker than the market on a % return basis over the last year, despite spy's incredible 2021 move.  so why pick a stock that is not going to net you as much return as just buying and holding the etf?  i think the smarter strategy is to analyze which of the sector etfs are currently hot and then from there pick your favourite stock(s) and hold/wheel that until it stops being stronger than the market.  then you cash out and move with the sector rotations.  for instance:

energy is really hot right now and industry is picking up.  oil and gas is also on fire.  tech and healthcare are still holding on by the skin of their teeth, so these might be okay dip buys.  on the flip side, retail trade, financials, and consumer durables are getting slaughtered right now after the sector rotation.

if you're going to buy and hold and grow, you want to buy and hold the strongest stocks until they are no longer strong.  use a long lens, 6months+ to form your opinion.  there's nothing wrong with f generally, and it pays a dividend which is nice, but you can probably find stocks that are going to outcompete it in the short-medium term without the frustration of only making $50-$60 on your money every week.  for example, a 1sd $xom put is going to gain you ~$85 per week , 41% more return on your # of shares vs. $f and its sector and it are much stronger than the market right now, and will likely continue the longer the ukraine war drags on and russian gas exports are crippled by the sanctions only leading to more demand and higher prices.",1,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0

1654684902,"you have a lot of safe plays in there but i actually like other options in regards to a portfolio where you want to supplement income. 

if you want higher dividends then in the sectors look at the following. 

tech - $avgo or $csco. higher dividend stocks with growth. not growth like apple or msft but still growth. 

health - $abbv or $$pfe. amazing returns the last few years and much higher dividends than jnj

telecom - there is really no great ones but $lumn is 8% and $t is 5%. i would actually rotate from telcom into an energy stock like $dvn or $xom right now. 

industrials - 3m is a steady dividend payer but a company like $dow or $ups has given growth with a competitive dividend. 3m has not offered much in terms of growth the last five years. 

cs - $ko is nice and steady but probably one of the best in this sector is $mo. high dividend and good growth, if you can handle owning a tobacco company this is a better ply than $ko for now and you can rotate to $ko if it takes a down turn. 

etf - $schd is the go to and $jepi is a high dividend payer. 

others to consider for income are bdcs like $gain, $glad, $pflt, $psec or the reits like $o or $good. all six of those are monthly dividends that pay at higher yields if you want income. 

but at 21 if you are looking for long term growth with a steady drip and minimal downside, that will turn into a nice supplemental income when you are older i like what you have except for 3m. i really want to add 3m to my portfolio but there is a lot of better companies right now in that sector with better dividends and growth.",18,,[deleted],0

[from my perspective, it looks like the system that they're trying to create is a compromise system that takes the worst parts of both systems and combines them... with the auction system, you \*should\* get better matches on orders, but at the expense of still getting less than you expect and reducing return for the brokerage. this keeps the negative of pfof while reducing the likelihood that your order will be matched without complication and increases the incentive to charge fees.  from the sec's perspective, this is a good thing, because the sec wants people trading less. people point to studies but in the end this is ideological and about style of investing. if you're a buy-and-hold type, this is good because it means people placing bigger trades in more predictable ways. if i have to pay $5 for a trade, i'm probably not going to make a $10 trade to dca intra-day but rather wait until i have more money. proponents of this argue that it forces people to time their exits and entries better and makes for less volatility in the market. there's probably some truth to that.  the problem is that the data we have is problematic because patterns change in the market for a variety of reasons and having commission free models combined with people engaged in the market more results in patterns that have little to do with ideal outcomes and more to do with higher frequency of trades.  basically, we're running up against the same problem as the pdt rule, which is that after the dotcom bubble, daytraders were blamed for the crash - which is absolute horseshit. institutions ran that market up as much as or more than anyone else. daytraders were just along for the ride.  the argument is fewer trades leads to better investment choices with less risk.   the problem? it absolutely fucking does not. what it does is trap people in bad trades, and that's good for institutions who can buy/sell in larger lots than retail traders and have write-offs and other considerations that negate business costs.  let's say i want to buy into a play for earnings and decided to spend $500 on some stock because i think the price will go up. so i buy in and am not worried about pdt at this point. the market turns against me and i decided i want out, but i don't want to burn a pdt.  i am now trapped, while a market maker is not.  market makers know this, and exploit the fuck out of it.  upping fees basically does the same thing by increasing the cost for a trade, promoting the introduction of capital into the market but effectively trapping people out of trade reversals if the market turns against them, and this pattern profoundly benefits institutions while leaving people to make trades which are just as risky as intra-day trading is (if anyone thinks holding overnight is less risky than exiting a losing position in a trade intra-day, they haven't spent enough time in the market lol).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v7uuai/sec_unveils_plan_to_overhaul_stock_trading_due_to/ibn250o/)

1654967826,"&gt; ""whether it's $150 oil, $200 oil or $100 oil, we're not going to change our growth plans,"" scott sheffield, ceo of pioneer natural resources, told bloomberg last month""

there's still the missing question of *why*. which you refuse to acknowledge or answer, or it's just ""big oil"" i guess. 

&gt;u.s. shale producers' decision this year to resist pumping more oil even as prices surge could be nearing an end, according to company executives.

&gt;several major oil companies, including bp plc (bp.l), chevron corp (cvx.n) and exxon mobil corp (xom.n), are planning to increase output or shale spending next year, undercutting opec's tight supply management that has pushed crude oil prices above $80 a barrel as global demand for fuel rebounded more swiftly than many anticipated.

&gt;the planning uptick in shale will come from larger companies and particularly from the permian basin, the top u.s. shale field. the change follows pressure from the white house for more production as retail fuel prices rise.

&gt;permian output is forecast to hit 4.89 million bpd in november, just below the peak 4.91 million bpd of march 2020 before the pandemic hit. the remaining shale regions, however, have lagged, producing a quarter less oil than at their peak in early 2020.

even biden admitted we need oil supply in *november*. 

&gt;why would they open up new drilling just to drive their own price down? why wouldn't they instead buy back their own stock to enrich themselves? 

cuz they're businesses...where they can enrich themselves *more* by selling more product. 

&gt;that's somehow biden's fault?

yes. via his energy policy. he shut down keystone xl, day one. he won't hold auctions for leases on land, let alone permits. 

https://youtu.be/cafde-5s8pq?t=47

""we would transition from the oil industry.""

&gt;bash: ""thank you, mr. vice president. just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a biden administration?""

&gt;biden: ""no, we would -- we would work it out. we would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either -- any fossil fuel.""

do you understand this yet?

&gt;they would have done that under any administration. they just would have given you a different narrative.

being that we have no time machine or alternate universe, we have what we have. might be a different narrative, likely would also be lower gas prices lmfao

&gt;putting it in your car might be far away now, but you never know.

oh what a relief, in 20-30 years, i can fill my car up with thorium salts...how does that help me fuel my car, in 2022? 

&gt;i don't see why you want to be stuck to the oil companies though. there is a future. the oil companies know it. i don't see what's so great at being held hostage to their whim.

the ""being stuck"" comes with understanding our current reality. how are we ""being held hostage""? we literally need gasoline and diesel lmfao. there's a very easy solution here...it doesn't involve price caps. do you just want difficult solutions, that wouldn't even necessarily work? 

&gt;they printed money a bunch of times and inflation didn't happen. why now? economists are trying to answer that. some are talking about market consolidation.

do you just not acknowledge that the last 2 years of shuttering economies, stopping factories in their tracks in china, has consequences? too much money (stimulus, otherwise) chasing too few goods (no chinese factories churning out products, no tourism, no leisure travel for more than a year). 

&gt;i don't understand why you have to see drilling for oil as the only solution. it's not. the oil companies know it. you're still buying their narrative. all they want is more money.

we lack crude oil supply. the solutions: buy it from elsewhere or get it ourselves. if they wanted more money, why wouldn't they drill more, and supply more oil? 

&gt;""as oil prices rise, it's increasingly likely that oil production growth resumes,"" said josh young, chief investment officer of energy investor bison interests. the gains, however, will remain below the rate of pre-covid-19 increases, he said.

&gt;overall u.s. crude production rose last week to *11.5 million barrels per day*, according to latest u.s. energy department figures, inching closer to its peak of about *13 million bpd* before the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. 

from november: 12% shortfall. 

&gt;do you know that peak oil already happened over a decade ago? the price of new drilling and the price set by demand have been competing with each other.

peak oil....peak oil production? that happened in 2019. peak oil demand? that's happening right now--2022.",1,,dumkopf604,0
1654984454,"‚Äúlos angeles, june 10 (reuters) - u.s. president joe biden on friday accused the u.s. oil industry, and exxon mobil corp (xom.n) in particular, of capitalizing on a supply shortage to fatten profits after a report showed inflation surging to a new 40-year record.

           ‚Äúexxon made more money than god this year,"" biden told reporters following a speech to dockworker union representatives at the port of 
            los angeles. u.s. oil companies are not using higher profits to drill more but to buy back stock, he added.

share buybacks improve earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, indirectly helping to boost share prices. companies see buybacks as a way to reward investors.

            ""why aren't they drilling? because they make more money not producing more oil,"" biden said. ""exxon, start investing and start paying 
              your taxes.""

exxon pushed back at the comments, noting it has continued to increase its u.s. oil, gasoline and diesel production, and had borrowed heavily to increase output while suffering losses in 2020.‚Äù",3,,BikkaZz,0

$ampy- do dd for this micro cap but it seems interesting to me. amplify hasn‚Äôt gained quite as meteorically as the rest of the sector because of uncertainty around an oil spill their rig caused off of the coast of ca last year. high oil prices help them out in a couple of ways: 1. a lot more free cash flow from their other assets. 2. government will allow them to fix the rig and restart it instead of listening to environmentalist pressures. also, any time something is beaten down there are catalyst opportunities. when they fix the broken rig, or if they win any lawsuits, the stock goes up. size it accordingly.

i don‚Äôt know when it happened exactly, but at some point my old man only trusted fox. blue bitches vs red righteous. 

i‚Äôm upset i can only talk to my mom now about literally anything. only common ground my dad and i have is that work is well and family updates. besides that, it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm not even visiting home. it‚Äôs right back to watching fox news. like dad. i don‚Äôt visit often, and we don‚Äôt have much in common. but he raised me and he‚Äôs the greatest man i know and still all i see is him saying hi and leaving to the other room to watch fox news. idk wtf to think about it.

https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-us-weighs-chevron-request-take-venezuela-oil-debt-payments-sources-2022-02-07/

&gt;  the biden administration is considering a chevron corp (cvx.n) proposal to allow the u.s. oil major to accept and trade venezuelan oil cargoes to recoup unpaid debt, four people close to the discussions said.

&gt; chevron wants washington to reinstate trading privileges it enjoyed for a time under former president donald trump's administration. the company and other foreign producers were permitted to take and export venezuelan oil to recoup dividends and debt from joint ventures with state-run oil company pdvsa.

&gt; that arrangement, which until mid-2020 allowed chevron to trade 1 million to 2 million barrels per month of venezuelan crude, was suspended under trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign.

&gt; besides chevron, european and asian oil companies with presence in venezuela have also pressed washington to trade venezuelan oil, according to sources.

&gt; ""if chevron's license is revamped, that will generate a cascade effect on other companies' lobbying,"" one of the people said.

the reason new refineries don't get built is typically because expanding existing ones is way cheaper and more efficient. still emphasis should be on ""*may* not"" here, since all kinds of circumstances could change.  

i don't get why anyone treats anything ceos say as much other than pr. it's practically against the principles of the organization to tell the (whole) truth if it could hurt profits.",9,,Sallowjoe,0
1655267817,"all a corporation needs to increase the price of their product, is something or somebody that can take the blame for it. there's a reason my exxon mobil stock has more than doubled in the last 9 months.

gas refineries routinely have ""emergency"" shutdowns in order to restrict the supply, thereby raising the price. 

and the corporate collusion...don't get me started. 

people who have no clue about the economy are just sheep who parrot whatever talking head says. prices go up...lets blame the other party. it doesn't matter whether it's the truth or not, we just need to blame someone.

are there other factors, such as russia, that affect prices, sure there are. but these other factors are only a convenient scapegoat for the greedy bastards who run the corporations to do what their stockholders want them to do. why do you think these corporations are setting record profits? they wouldn't be if their costs go up and they only increase prices to cover these costs.",35,,69_mgusta,0

[abnbs ev/fcf is pretty reasonable at around 20. the pe is higher mostly because of stock based compensation. although arguably stock based comp is an employee expense, so i guess it depends on how you want to look at it.  their gross margins are also extremely good at 80%. their operating income would be 4x higher if you strip out their r&amp;d expenses, but obviously they're investing in their tech which makes sense for a growing company so you probably wouldn't want them to do that.  my point is that they have the potential to be far more profitable than they currently are. they could easily achieve 40% operating profit margins which on current revs would probably mean the stock needs to be trading closer to $200. with a bit of rev growth on top of that it could be trading well above that in 5-10 years time.  there are risks with abnb though. personally i struggle with how strong their moat is. they have the brand recognition and the network effects in their favour which should make them a pretty safe bet, but other booking platforms could potentially enter the space and take market share from abnb. even a goog, aapl or meta, could potentially enter the space. goog and aapl because of maps and meta because of the p2p aspect of it. i'm also a little worried about regulation, but history would suggest investors worry too much about tech regulation. regulation might increase their costs a little, but it's unlikely to prevent them trading out right. regulation may also make it harder for competition to enter the space so it's not all bad.](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icd69c6/)

1655396584,"i'm almost certain i opened with ""i was fortunate."" before i enlisted i'd managed to squirrel away money painting and roofing houses in high school with a friend and his dad. luckily that nest egg grew more than enough in four years to buy a used car when i was discharged. the gi bill covered school. i returned to live with my parents for several months. if you read down the thread a ways, you'll see i admit that luck - good and bad - was/is the big player in most folks' stories. if i'd fallen in love and set about spawning immediately after high school, as most in my class did, my story trajectory would've been very different. i've heard all my life, ""neither borrower nor lender be."" that sounded reasonable, so i worked to avoid lenders, except with purchases of real estate (fsbo - realtors take 6%). by all means, please borrow; i hold banking stocks.

as for gas prices, capitalism insists companies maximize profits; oil companies are no exception. those optimized profits and their resulting dividends are at root of why people buy stocks in companies like... $xom. i and millions of others are celebrating oil company profits. join us... or not.

""low"" is a relative term. if you are buying a used car, the interest rate you get *should* be relatively high compared to the rate offered for new cars. if it is not, you're likely paying more for the car than it's worth, so beware, or choose to trust the seller - your call. i'm aware of the value of free advice, but the counsel my folks gave me ensured the only debt i ever carried was for the purchase of appreciating assets, and then only rarely and with thorough due diligence.

circumstances are everything, and i recognize mine were fortunate. you be you, and i'll work on being less of a judge mental, less... magniloquent. good luck.",2,,forchimpssake,0

1655623239,"june 17 (reuters) - a 650,000-barrel-cargo of venezuela's oil chartered by italy's eni (eni.mi) is about to set sail carrying the first export of crude from the u.s.-sanctioned country to europe in two years, refinitiv eikon data showed on friday.

the u.s. state department sent letters to eni and spain's repsol (rep.mc) in may authorizing them to resume taking venezuelan crude as a way to settle billions of dollars of unpaid debt and dividends owed by the opec-member nation.

a second tanker chartered by eni, the very large crude carrier (vlcc) pantanassa, is currently navigating towards venezuela and expected to load 2 million barrels of the same grade, diluted crude oil (dco), and take it to europe, according to the eikon data and a shipping document seen by reuters.

that cargo is expected to be delivered by venezuela's state-owned pdvsa later this month with an option for eni to sell a portion of the crude to spain's repsol (rep.mc)for its cartagena and bilbao refineries, according to the document and sources.

the malta-flagged pantanassa is scheduled to load via ship-to-ship transfer near venezuela's amuay port, the document added.

eni, repsol and pdvsa did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

venezuela's may oil exports plummeted to the lowest level in 19 months over contract changes enforced by pdvsa to switch most spot sales to prepayment, reducing the risk of unpaid cargoes. the change did not affect customers under swap deals of debt payment agreements.

european, asian and u.s. companies operating joint ventures with pdvsa in venezuela, including eni, repsol, chevron (cvx.n), ongc ltd (ongc.ns), and maurel &amp; prom (maup.pa), have accumulated billions of dollars in pending debt since the government of then u.s. president donald trump suspended oil swaps used for exchanging venezuelan oil for fuel and debt payments.",11,,Massimo24ore,0

buffet is getting up there, if he really wants berkshire energy to be a giant, maybe he‚Äôll take the rest of it over, at the right price, of course. they do have a fairly sizable debt outstanding, almost $30 billion, with $10 bn in current assets and $60 bn in net pp&amp;e. they‚Äôve made a push the past two or three years to pay back that debt, and over five years they have doubled their revenue.  

the thing is, even if, say, oil and gas was banned in the usa tomorrow, you‚Äôd still have cars on the road for 30 years more. easily. they also make a number of other chemical products, outside of oil and gas.

i could see some type of handshake deal, where if they get their balance sheet into better shape, pay off some debt, and maybe engage some share repurchases, that in 3-5 years you might see a deal there, if not sooner. 

buffet probably only has so many more landmark deals in him. allegheny was major, but relatively small for brk. armand hammer was involved heavily in this company. he died 32 years ago, but i guarantee buffet knew him well. 

the stock fell as low as $9.00 a share in 2020, and still hasn‚Äôt recovered to the $80+ high pre-pandemic. this places the high market cap over $70 bn, although this was really back in 2018, when the price began to steadily fall. i‚Äôd have to look further into that decline period, to understand it better.",5,,hotelactual777,0
