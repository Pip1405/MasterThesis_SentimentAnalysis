sidenote: brk's ownership % of oxy will be slightly different once their warrants and the 87 million oxy warrants ($oxy.ws) are exercised given they both will dilute all oxy common shareholders. brk's warrants won't provide any cash for the company because it's setup that brk's preferred stock can be given as payment to exercise the warrants, but the $oxy.ws warrants will bring a small ~$1.9b cash infusion for the company.",4,,mn_sunny,0

at 51.65 i can close the shares and short call and get that long call for free haha.  if it gets down there again i'll try that.

&gt; moscow, july 6 (reuters) - caspian pipeline consortium (cpc), which takes oil from kazakhstan to the black sea via one of the world's largest pipelines, has been told by a russian court to suspend activity for 30 days although sources said exports were still flowing.
&gt; 
&gt; cpc, which handles about 1% of global oil, said the ruling to suspend operations related to paperwork on oil spills and said the consortium, which includes u.s. firms chevron and exxon [(xom.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/xom.n), had to abide by the ruling which was issued on tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; two trading sources familiar with the terminal operations told reuters oil exports from the cpc terminal on the black sea were continuing on wednesday morning, after tuesday's ruling.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; three other industry sources said oil supplies from fields to the cpc pipeline were uninterrupted as of wednesday morning.
&gt; 
&gt; cpc declined further comment on its activity and operations.
&gt; 
&gt; any major disruption to the cpc would put further strain on the global oil market which is facing one of its the worst supply crunches since the arab oil embargo in the 1970s.
&gt; 
&gt; the cpc pipeline has been in the spotlight since russia calls a ""special military operation"" in ukraine, which has restricted russian exports amid western sanctions and led to an oil price spike.
&gt; 
&gt; russia has already reduced gas flows via the nord stream 1 gas pipeline, which supplies russian gas to germany and other european states. that pipeline has been operating a 40% capacity because of a dispute over equipment repairs.
&gt; 
&gt; the united states has imposed sanctions on russian oil but has said flows from kazakhstan through russia should run uninterrupted.
&gt; 
&gt; a terminal situation report seen by reuters showed oil loadings from cpc terminal were continuing as of midday on july 5 but it was not clear if operations were continuing on july 6.
&gt; 
&gt; cpc said on wednesday that russian deputy prime minister viktoria abramchenko ordered regulators, including industrial safety regulator rostekhnadzor, to inspect the facilities of the russian part of the consortium.
&gt; 
&gt; it said the inspection has found some ""documentary"" irregularities on plans on how to tackle oil spills. an oil spill occurred at the terminal last year.
&gt; 
&gt; the pipeline exported up to 54 million tonnes, or some 1.2 million barrels per day, of kazakhstan's main crude grade, light sour cpc blend , last year from the black sea.
&gt; 
&gt; the pipeline's operations have already been interrupted by damage to the black sea's terminal equipment this year.

1657153779,"&gt; when much of that corporation‚Äôs profit (more than what trickles down to the average citizen) is put to use lobbying the government for pro-fossil fuel positions.

this might sound a bit crazy, but if you look into it, they don't really spend that much money. exxon mobil has spent $859,000 over the past year giving to both democrats and republicans. they spent about $6.8 million total including the the lawyers/lobbying firms. that's on about $5.5 billion in net income, just in the last 3 months. the whole oil and gas industry combined in their biggest spending year (2020 leading up to the election) spent $140 million. that means if americans spent 50 cents each, they could outspend the entire industry.

https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=e01

&gt; i find it highly doubtful that exxon mobil would intentionally invest in long-term alternative energy solutions over short term profits.

i don't think they really care how they make their money. it's like a chef in a restaurant. if you order pizza, they'll make you a pizza. if you order pasta, they'll make you pasta. they just want you to give them money. 

[i think the real reason why alternative energy has gained popularity is because technological advances have made them cheaper than oil.](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/808016558/as-solar-energys-price-has-dropped-more-companies-get-onboard) but there's still no good battery tech to store energy overnight so there is still value in fossil fuels, especially oil. but if exxon can get the same amount of revenue for less cost, they'll be thrilled.

&gt; evs are beginning to catch on but only because of tremendous public pressure around the world. 

this is the value of taxes and subsidies. if governments make it cheaper to produce new alternative energy technology and more expensive to produce fossil fuels, then the chef will start making more pizza than pasta.

&gt; it‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúwe want cheaper gas as consumers‚Äù when that‚Äôs the only option for the lay person. 

i want cheaper gas as a consumer, but i vote to implement higher gas taxes and fossil fuel regulations. i appreciate the small amount of money i get from owning exxon mobil stock, but also the small amount i get from owning tesla (and the other 10,000 companies in a total world index fund). i like that fossil fuels sales provide tax revenue to the government, but dislike that it destroys part of the atmosphere that i own 1/7 billionths of. everything we do has good and bad actions for ourselves and everyone else. we have to balance the party and the hangover.

&gt; the weight of this statement is diminished by how concentrated in the hands of the few that 0.8% is.

sure, but we choose who those people are. we vote for a president who has the power to nuke everyone on earth with the push of a button. that's a lot of power concentrated in a single person. similarly, we vote with our dollars when it comes to investing. elon musk is a billionaire because investors are willing to spend about $700 for a share of tesla stock, even though it's an unprofitable company. there's about a billion shares of tesla in the world so the total value of the company is about $700 billion. elon musk owns about 20% off the company, which means he owns about $140 billion worth of tesla stock. investors are giving up their hard earned money today for elon's promise of more money tomorrow.

meanwhile, if i made that same promise, i'm guessing people wouldn't be willing to give me their cash. similarly, if i offered to hold onto the nuclear football, people wouldn't vote to entrust me with it. investors choose who they want to entrust with their money/financial power and exactly how much they want to give (e.g., what percentage of their life savings they want to give to musk). voters chose who they want to entrust with their political power, but they can't choose how much they give (that is determined by the total number of voters in a given district.) 

i use a hat example, but another way to think about is like magical powers. as a consumer, you have the power to buy a product (increase demand) or boycott a product (decrease demand). as a worker, you can increase or decrease supply. as an investor you can choose who you want to give power (including yourself), but the minute you decide you no longer trust elon musk, you can sell your tesla shares. tesla's value is down 42% since january 1, and so is elon musk's net worth and overall power. as a voter, your power is relatively weak. you can only replace presidents once every four years, and there are fewer options to choose from (a few candidates vs. thousands of companies and potential ceos). if you vote to give some ceo the power to lobby the government, that's fine. but it's coming out of your pocket. to bring it back to the beginning, this is why investors don't like spending a ton of money on lobbying. it's a waste of resources to vote for carbon taxes, and also pay a ceo to lobby the government against carbon taxes. this is why exxon mobil's executives/board lost a battle with an environmental activist/hedge fund known as engine no. 1.

https://qz.com/2014413/engine-no-1-the-little-hedge-fund-that-shook-exxonmobil/

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/exxon-mobil-engine-no-1-board.html

the last point i'll make about this is that if you're a citizen who is only using your power as a voter, you're not using all your other powers to enact the change you want in the world. most people on reddit are afraid of or angry at hedge funds, for example. but some people recognize how simple it is to form their own hedge fund and ""lobby"" corporations. some people look at a corrupt government and want to destroy the government. others figure out out how to take over and improve the government. you need to use all your hats/powers if you want to have real influence in the world. it's hard/expensive to outspend corporate lobbying. it's less hard/expensive to oust out a ceo, and limit/change corporate lobbying.",2,,McKoijion,0

- russische roh√∂lproduktion ging im juli weiter zur√ºck, liegt allerdings noch im rahmen der vorjahre. gemutma√üt wird ja, dass sich ab der zweiten jahresh√§lfte eine deutliche f√∂rdermengenverringerung einstellen k√∂nnte. zum einen ist die zweite jahresh√§lfte in russland generell die schw√§chere (klimatisch bedingt, wartungszyklen, ...) zum anderen k√∂nnten sich dann die sanktionen des westens bemerkbar machen, was die aufrechterhaltung der technik und infrastruktur angeht (https://nitter.net/hfi_research/status/1544755281917161472#m)
- der physikalische √∂lmarkt ist weiterhin extrem eng, die nachfrage nach f√§ssern ungebrochen, volles backwardation-szenario (https://nitter.net/paulomacro/status/1544807505477386240#m)
- was ich allerdings mal wieder auf die harte tour lernen musste: die realit√§t muss nicht viel mit den finanzm√§rkten und papierpreisen zu tun zu haben und der markt kann definitiv l√§nger irrational als ich liquide bleiben. sobald wti f√ºr drei tage in folge unter 80 talern je fass liegt werde ich die notbremse ziehen und einen gro√üteil meiner erd√∂l-positionen aufl√∂sen.

*****
&gt; norway&amp;#039;s government has approved expansion plans for the country&amp;#039;s second largest gas field, ormen lange, as well as development plans for the frosk and tommeliten a discoveries, the oil and energy ministry said on friday.

&gt; the field, operated by shell shel.l and located in the norwegian sea, will as a result increase gas recovery from 75% to 85%, the ministry said.

&gt; tommeliten a, which is partly located on the british side of the north sea, is operated by conocophillips cop.n and co-owned with pgnig pgnifn.ul, totalenergies ttef.pa and vaar energi var.ol. expected recoverable reserves at tommeliten a are estimated at about 21 million standard cubic metres of oil equivalent, of which slightly more than three quarters is gas, the ministry said.

also, if you were actually in my discord and twitter, then you should've made bank on all of the non-squeeze stocks i gave. literally $oxy is up over 10% since my loading zone alert, $labu up over 10%, $soxl up over 10%, $clf nearly up over 10%, and many times where we played $sqqq and $tqqq for over 20% gain on commons and over 200-500% gain on options. also $tsla, $amd, $nvda, we all made gains on those and options multi-bagged. played both $kold and $boil too for over 30% gain... lol... the list of winners go on. and again, you had plenty of time to get in, and plenty of time to get out.

lastly, if you can't handle squeeze stocks then don't trade them. i give many plays that are non-squeeze stocks, and to be factual i've given more non-squeeze setups than non-squeeze for the past 3 months. additionally, i already wrote multiple risk management guides on both twitter and discord, and people still manage to make a winning trade go red.

1658596529,"\&gt;the recent ruling on new york rifle and pistol association v. bruen is a case where a majority conservative scotus made a great ruling, and not necessarily because guns

i have no ideas how this constitutionally recognized right will benefit the country, other than making this country as sh&amp;thole, nothing less than a battlefield in today's ukraine, where more than 100 persons die or injured per each day.

thank you for scotus to benefit this country, we should be grateful. 

\&gt; the epa ruling that more or less ended chevron deference doctrine is another case where a majority conservative scotus benefited this country fantastically, 

again thank you for scotus for americans population to suffer in this hot weather and ending up with spending more money to energy bills. the current climate change will give painful lesson to america's environment as well as population. especially climate change will give severe economic and societal changes to rural america, where r is voting them anyway, so i would let them simply suffer. good luck. the karma is on you, conservative. 

\&gt;i don't live on this website like you. i actually do things outside of this echo chamber. i don't respond to a lot of things.

not saying i am living on this website, because i was just analyzing some financial statement with $cvx and $oxy. again, i make big bucks thanks to conservative sides, but i dont appreciate them at all.",2,,taintmoun,0

if something were to happen to you and your company, it would probably be an armed robbery, petty theft, or pickpocketing. don't trust people just because they talk to you or approach you in a friendly way (we are very friendly, but some people use it for their advantage), and if you are going to buy something in the street (food, snacks, etc.) for more than 20k $cop and it's not something that looks large or expensive then you are probably getting scammed. just don't look like somebody that's easy to rob or manipulate, and everything should be fine.",2,,MasterBlazx,0

the other thing is if the fed stops raising rates (or at a slower pace) it signals inflaiton is under control.  markets responsible well to certainty.
