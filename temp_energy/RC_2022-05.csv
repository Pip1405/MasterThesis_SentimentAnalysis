my take is that oil will continue to be highly profitable(crush earnings) even if the crude price falls. it doesn’t need to be that high to have great margins. above average dividends as well. energy will continue to outperform the rest of the market imo. 

pent up demand for summer travel is already showing very positive signs. it’s already incredibly hard to find hotels and flights if you haven’t already booked summer plans. 

i remember reading articles in mid 2021 about how more americans than ever have large amounts of cash in savings due to all of that stimulus money. it’s weird how we don’t hear about that anymore. i think some spending will dip(activities that boomed when we were locked down like netflix) but travel will be fine. 

long term, oil demand will continue to rise with rising gdp worldwide. us can go electric and every emerging market is more than making up the difference.",3,,Uknow_nothing,0

por exemplo, investindo no famoso vwce, você nota que as perdas até à data são de 6% quando comparando com o vt (vanguard total stock market etf) em que as perdas são de 13.8%. porque é que isto acontece quando ambos são virtualmente idênticos? porque o vwce é um fundo cotado em euros mas o investimento feito é em dólares, que graças à força relativa do dólar em relação ao euro, mitiga as perdas do fundo. o vt é um fundo cotado em dólares e o investimento é realizado em dólares.

darei um exemplo:

se você decidisse converter euros em dólares no início de janeiro (eur/usd 1,14) para comprar ações da exxon ($xom) e, agora queria vender quais seriam os seus retornos em usd e em eur?

eis a matemática para 10.000€:

1- conversão eur em usd -&gt; 10.000€ seriam 11.400$ (eur/usd 1,14).

2- comprar ações da xom a 64$ (\~178 ações)

3- retorno de 34,17% ytd, em que as ações da xom valem 85,25$. (178\*85,25 = 15.174,50$)

4- conversão usd em eur -&gt; 15.174,50$ são convertidos em 14.451€ (eur/usd 1,05)-

5- investimento inicial: 10.000€ valor atual: 14.451€ retorno absoluto: 4.451€ retorno relativo: 44,52%

posição euro - retorno 44,52%; posição dólar - retorno 34,17%

assim, as taxas de conversão apenas beneficiam aqueles que efetuaram investimentos em dólares e que posteriormente os vão converter em euros. minimizam as perdas e maximizam os ganhos.

um investidor informado tem de saber que a conversão de moeda são conceitos importantes a reter para poder maximizar os ganhos.

[not sure what your goals are or what the rest of your portfolio looks like, but you've got a nice nest egg going here.  my personal opinion is aapl had a great quarter, but it's obvious they have been slowing down. 9% growth isn't magical. their 3yr revenue cagr is just half that of google, microsoft, and amazon. they are growing slower than others &amp;they have a higher p/e ratio than google, slightly lower than msft, and a much better one than amazon. i think the market is heavily pricing in growth from something else (apple car? hoping they can grow their higher margin software lines? etc. all legit possibilities, but not guaranteed)  with that in mind, you might want to trim *out* of apple, but i'd still hold most of it. not sure how risky you want to be, but it may be worthwhile trimming about 25-50k a month and buying voo until you get down to 500k in apple or so. slowly dca out of aapl and into the s&amp;p basically.  i'm not going to recommend you any specific stocks, but i do think they are slightly overvalued and in the long run it's worth slowly getting all of your eggs out of a single basket. i still like them long term and definitely worth holding a significant position there.  if you're more income oriented, could easily put some into schd or jepi along with voo. maybe eventually aim for 100k in each of those along with your remaining 400-500k in apple and you'd have a lot more downside risk protection in the long run imo.](/r/stocks/comments/ufcxta/730k_aapl_position_looking_to_diversify_any/i6tv7pn/)

[you're basically just pulling numbers out of hat. the situation in late 2018 was different than today. arguably the economic backdrop today is worse, but then again a lot of nasdaq stocks have already been hit significantly harder than in late 2018. most tech stocks are trading significantly below the valuations they hit going into 2019 at this point.  i can't help but feel the nasdaq is really going to struggle to fall much lower. for example i've been running numbers on amzn and how i run them it looks unbelievably undervalued at this point. you basically have to assume that their ecommerce segment will continue to drag on the business for years. same with fb and nflx. i don't think they're great businesses, but they are significantly undervalued in my opinion.  then there are the quality quality growth stocks like shop which are now trading at their lowest valuation in like 7 years despite now being profitable and being far less risky than they were in say 2016 because of their scale and maturity.  it's even getting hard to argue trash ""growth"" stocks like hood or tdoc should fall more. i'm not saying they couldn't fall more if their businesses continue to struggle, but they're certainly not expensive at this point and the risks appear to be almost entirely priced in.  however, the market isn't rational and if you're a boomer you're probably not even aware the market is tanking because a lot of boomer stocks are so overvalued, at least relative to historical valuations, which isn't true of tech stocks. so perhaps now we're going to see boomer stocks take a hit for a while and that panic might drag the qqq a little lower before a sharp recovery in a few weeks/months.](/r/stocks/comments/ufis9n/hindsight_reversion_to_the_mean_suggests_market/i6w9l0g/)

[when uncertainty is high, markets tends to overreact strongly, like they did on friday with amazon (-15% and rsi was 27 at one point). certainly alot of traders are also banking betting short, pushing prices further down. but people who bail out fail to realize rivian investment was a big part of the loss (down -70%) and without it, they would have had a respectable quarter. rivian cannot go down much further to incur what was lost in q1. these types of things become amidst extremely volatile market conditions, and people can make desperate decisions based in their situations. but weather the stock is googl or aapl, most traders nowadays don’t want to hold positions over the long term, and are simply looking for plays. fair and understandable, but for large cap stocks over the longterm, it doesn’t make sense to jump ship unless you need that money today, or if you cannot see the company being profitable in two years. amazon will always had revenue streams. google ad revenue alone will always have revenue streams. aapl will always have a strong q4 every year. these are the things overlooked by traders just looking at what is good now vs. what will be a bigger return in the future.](/r/stocks/comments/ufxal8/the_stock_market_is_the_greatest_tool_to_build/i6yawaz/)

[not sure what your goals are or what the rest of your portfolio looks like, but you've got a nice nest egg going here.  my personal opinion is aapl had a great quarter, but it's obvious they have been slowing down. 9% growth isn't magical. their 3yr revenue cagr is just half that of google, microsoft, and amazon. they are growing slower than others &amp;they have a higher p/e ratio than google, slightly lower than msft, and a much better one than amazon. i think the market is heavily pricing in growth from something else (apple car? hoping they can grow their higher margin software lines? etc. all legit possibilities, but not guaranteed)  with that in mind, you might want to trim *out* of apple, but i'd still hold most of it. not sure how risky you want to be, but it may be worthwhile trimming about 25-50k a month and buying voo until you get down to 500k in apple or so. slowly dca out of aapl and into the s&amp;p basically.  i'm not going to recommend you any specific stocks, but i do think they are slightly overvalued and in the long run it's worth slowly getting all of your eggs out of a single basket. i still like them long term and definitely worth holding a significant position there.  if you're more income oriented, could easily put some into schd or jepi along with voo. maybe eventually aim for 100k in each of those along with your remaining 400-500k in apple and you'd have a lot more downside risk protection in the long run imo.](/r/stocks/comments/ufcxta/730k_aapl_position_looking_to_diversify_any/i6tv7pn/)

[when uncertainty is high, markets tends to overreact strongly, like they did on friday with amazon (-15% and rsi was 27 at one point). certainly alot of traders are also banking betting short, pushing prices further down. but people who bail out fail to realize rivian investment was a big part of the loss (down -70%) and without it, they would have had a respectable quarter. rivian cannot go down much further to incur what was lost in q1. these types of things become amidst extremely volatile market conditions, and people can make desperate decisions based in their situations. but weather the stock is googl or aapl, most traders nowadays don’t want to hold positions over the long term, and are simply looking for plays. fair and understandable, but for large cap stocks over the longterm, it doesn’t make sense to jump ship unless you need that money today, or if you cannot see the company being profitable in two years. amazon will always had revenue streams. google ad revenue alone will always have revenue streams. aapl will always have a strong q4 every year. these are the things overlooked by traders just looking at what is good now vs. what will be a bigger return in the future.](/r/stocks/comments/ufxal8/the_stock_market_is_the_greatest_tool_to_build/i6yawaz/)

[the correct earning multiples depends on the growth and the quality of the earnings.  aws is growing at around 40% yoy and those revenues are extremely high quality. it's hard for customers to switch and billing is reoccurring. if aapl saw a 40% yoy growth in sales you'd have to question how sustainable that revenue growth is which you don't have to do with aws. this allows us to assign a higher earnings multiple because we don't need to discount them to account for the risk that they might not be sustainable.  the growth rate and moat of aws is also insane. this is a company we can safety assume will continue to grow rapidly for years with almost no risk of being disrupted - at least near-term.  when you consider all of this a 38x multiple is stupidly low. this would be a similar multiple we give to companies like cost &amp; v. in my opinion a 50 pe is far more reasonable given current market valuations, but i think an argument could be made that market valuations generally are too high and therefore a multiple closer to 40 might be more appropriate in this environment.](/r/stocks/comments/ui9msi/when_comparing_it_to_the_m2_money_supply_amzn/i7eln7f/)

[thanks for the comments!  fortunately, i don't need the money right now. i have a good salary and still has about 10% cash.   few months back, i passed an opportunity to buy an apartment because i didn't want to liquidate at a loss for the down payment (at that time, i was down maybe 15%). i have been dcaing instead, but as you all know, the dips kept dipping. my portfolio has gone down roughly for the down payment i needed since that time, the irony! i regret not buying the apartment quite a lot! but hindsight is 20/20.  with regard to my holdings:  \- some good companies that i am not scared about (msft, amzn, apple, goog).. apple still up around 30%, msft just 1% down, goog about 5% down, amzn about 14% down. if i was just in these, i wouldnt have bothered at all.  \- i have pypl and se, which i like as good companies to hold for long term, but they have been battered to pieces lately and down 40 and 45% at the moment (worth around 30k each at today's valuation)  \-i have baba and bidu, which i have been bagholding for a while (both ""only"" about 20% down, due to dcaing a lot, but now i have like 100k in total in the two at today's valuation),  \- and the shittiest of all, tdoc, which i am at -68% at the moment (like -40k just in that one).  this, i have almost accepted as gone, expensive lesson learned on when to take profits or stop dcaing (i was up more than 100% in this pos early 2021 when it was around 300$, ...i was breaking even around june 2021..).](/r/stocks/comments/uj3lja/how_long_can_we_go/i7i3wfa/)

[because aapl is overvalued and the fact that many people agree is obvious from its downtrend. it doesn't matter if you have sound fundamentals and produce tangible goods if you're way overvalued for the business and economic environment.  when a stock gets caught up in a selloff of the broader market  or sector, and will bounce back up as soon as the selloff is over, that is a dip. none of these mega cap tech stocks are in that situation. they are mostly what are dragging the indexes down.  there's a difference between a dip and a correction. using the word ""dip"" implies that the stock will bounce back up again. i buy dips all the time -- of stocks that are actually growing. when you buy into stocks that are sinking, you're just buying falling stocks. it's more likely that aapl is in a correction, where it's reverting to a less unrealistic value. people who think they are buying the dip when they keep buying these overvalued mega cap/tech stocks as they slide are just preventing them from correcting quickly and they keeping the market from reaching a bottom quickly.](/r/stocks/comments/uiz9kf/the_nasdaq_was_up_319_on_wednesday_and_has_fallen/i7gyuca/)

[&gt;what i am trying to say here is that anticipation of recession is paraded as the cause for the current market turmoil, but it's not.   you're definitely correct that there's deflation going on.  but i think you're missing some other factors, the massive supply chain problems being the biggest ones.  china is still messed up and the supply chain problem isn't going to fix itself in the next 6-8mo.  also pundits are missing the boat about the employment market.  just over a year ago millions of people were out of work because tons of restaurants and other entertainment venues had closed.  where are the people who worked in those places?  millions of people are trying to live real life without real jobs by trading or selling on ebay or whatever.  but as the income those ""jobs"" produce dries up the unemployment lines are going to get longer.  it shouldn't surprise anyone that tech companies are as busy as ever.  how much cash does msft have?  like $90b?  same for aapl, goog, fb.  but they aren't the whole economy.    then there is inflation, and last but not least the situation in ukraine is a very big uncertainty.    overall seems like there's a good chance the markets will remain negative this year.](/r/stocks/comments/ujalrc/how_long_do_you_all_believe_this_downturn_will/i7ip32h/)

1651889157,"new delhi, april 28 (reuters) - india has asked state-run energy companies to evaluate the possibility of buying european oil major bp's (bp.l) stake in sanctions-hit russian firm rosneft, two people familiar with the matter said.

bp has announced it is abandoning its 19.75% stake in rosneft. read more

the oil ministry last week conveyed its intent to ongc videsh ltd (ovl), indian oil corp. (ioc.ns), bharat petro resources ltd (bprl), hindustan pertoleum's (hpcl.ns) subsidiary prize petroleum ltd, oil india ltd (oili.ns) and gail (india) ltd (gail.ns), the sources said.

indian companies and the oil ministry did not respond to reuters emails seeking comment.

while western nations have imposed sanctions against russia over the war in ukraine, india has not explicitly condemned moscow's actions there.

the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, india imports about 85% of its 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil needs.

the call on indian companies to explore buying the stake in rosneft came after bp ceo bernard looney met indian oil minister hardeep singh puri in march.

bp declined to comment.

oil ministry also asked ovl, the overseas investment arm of oil and natural gas corp (ongc.ns), to consider buying a 30% stake held by exxon mobile corp (xom.n), in the sakhalin 1 project in russia's far east. exxon is the operator of the project.

ovl already holds a 20% stake in the project.

exxon said on march 1 it would exit about $4 billion in assets and discontinue all its russia operations, including sakhalin 1.

ovl also holds 26% stake in vankorneft, owner of the venkor field in the west siberian basin.

separately, a consortium of oil india, ioc, and bprl, the exploration arm of state refiner bharat petroleum corp (bpcl.ns), holds a 23.9% stake in vankorneft and a 29.9% stake in taas-yuryakh in east siberia.

one of the sources said indian companies hope to get stakes in russian assets at discounted rates given the risk involved, dubbing the potential transactions ""distress sales"".

a second source said indian companies needed to study the impact of sanctions on potential investments and yet to start a process of due diligence.

""the fear is that this investment could get stuck in russia as sanctions might bar us from bringing equity oil and gas to india.""

""our effort has been to see how we can stabilise economic transactions, economic engagements with russia in the current context ... there are of course constraints, there are sanctions by some countries, and we will have to kind of work through that,"" india's foreign ministry spokesperson arindam bagchi told a news conference.

exxon said on wednesday its russian unit exxon neftegas ltd has declared force majeure for its sakhalin-1 operations due to sanctions on russia that have made it increasingly difficult to ship crude to customers.",1,,ShootingPains,0

it would have been better to think of the marcos voters as a force of nature rather than the ""general public"" that you must sway towards the light. they simply will not see it that way, because they don't want to think about their vote. they know what the people around them tell them and that's fucking it. i know because i am friends with some of them. and thus, like any force of nature, you can either use it or let it kill you.

the same attitude that lets you shrug off accountability right now is the same attitude that fueled the ""fighting"" that transpired to win leni the presidency. it's the classic liberal thought paradigm of ""i am right, i have the moral high ground, therefore i *have* to win"".  this manifested itself in a legion of fucktards in pink trying to convince an even bigger and even stupider legion of fucktards in red using graphs, facts, numbers, percentages, exxon mobil stock price. which the bbm crowd responded to precisely zero percent of.

you know what those morons respond to? tribalism. propaganda. [flashy promises and nationalistic non-statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baetveez2wo). you can lament that all you want, but that's the sad reality of this turd-smattering of an archipelago. most people here are dumb. you should have used that as a vehicle for better governance, that would in turn put us on a path to becoming at least slightly less dumb.

you people don't want to hear it, but blame is shared here. the only thing this election has showed me is that the two sides at odds are merely two sides of the same dumbass coin. they're both composed of emotional whelps whose sole stratagem is to rush headlong into violent sociopolitical discourse that ultimately leads nowhere. devoid of any semblance of foresight, introspection, or cunning.

next election sana tubuan naman kayo ng finesse, fucking ina.",5,,SingingScreaming,0

just my thoughts. i dont know how i will vote or whether i'll still be a stockholder on may 27th or not. im taking this day by day and seeing how it all plays out. i am very excited to find out though and i wish all of you luck!",7,,Joper407,0

1652806473,"london/basra, may 17 (reuters) - iraq's oil ministry thwarted three prospective deals last year that would have handed chinese firms more control over its oilfields and led to an exodus of international oil majors that baghdad wants to invest in its creaking economy.

since the start of 2021, plans by russia's lukoil (lkoh.mm) and u.s. oil major exxon mobil (xom.n) to sell stakes in major fields to chinese state-backed firms have hit the buffers after interventions from iraq's oil ministry, according to iraqi oil officials and industry executives.

selling a stake to a state-run chinese company was also one of several options being considered by britain's bp (bp.l), but officials persuaded it to stay in iraq for now, people familiar with the matter said.

china is iraq's top investor and baghdad was the biggest beneficiary last year of beijing's belt and road initiative, receiving $10.5 billion in financing for infrastructure projects including a power plant and an airport.

but when it comes to further chinese investment in major oilfields, baghdad has drawn a line in the sand.

iraq's government and officials at state-run firms are concerned that further consolidation of fields in the hands of chinese companies could accelerate an exodus of western oil companies, a total of seven iraqi oil officials and executives with companies operating in iraq told reuters in interviews.

supported by state-run oil company officials, iraq's oil minister ihsan abdul jabbar dissuaded lukoil last year from selling a stake in one of the country's largest fields, west qurna 2, to chinese state firm sinopec , three people familiar with the matter said.

iraqi officials also intervened last year to stop chinese state-backed firms buying exxon's stake in west qurna 1 and to persuade bp (bp.l) to stay in iraq rather than offloading its interest in the giant rumaila oilfield to a chinese company, people familiar with the matter said.

combined, rumaila and west qurna produce about half of the crude coming out of iraq, which sits on the fifth-largest oil reserves in the world.

iraq's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the deals or the minister's role in any interventions.

the government worried that china's dominance could make iraq less attractive for investment from elsewhere, two government officials said.

china's strengthening relationship with iran has helped its position in iraq due to tehran's political and military influence there, but the oil ministry is wary of ceding more control over the country's key resources, some officials said.

""we don't want the iraqi energy sector to be labelled as a china-led energy sector and this attitude is agreed by government and the oil ministry,"" another iraqi official said.

risky strategy
the interventions over bp, exxon and lukoil's positions in iraq come after british oil major shell (shel.l) decided in 2018 to withdraw from iraq's vast majnoon oilfield.

the interventions also mark a shift in stance after chinese companies won most energy deals and contracts awarded over the past four years. iraqi oil officials said chinese firms have accepted lower profit margins than most rivals.

""all the rules regarding tenders were formulated jointly by the chinese and iraqi sides and were conducted under transparent and fair principles,"" said state-owned china national offshore oil corporation (cnooc) (0883.hk) in an emailed statement.

pushing back against further chinese investment is a risky strategy, though, as there's no guarantee others will step up and the government needs billions of dollars to rebuild the economy after the islamic state insurgency was defeated in 2017.

over the past decade, oil revenue accounted for 99% of iraq's exports, 85% of the country's budget and 42% of its gross domestic product, according to the world bank.

while oil majors jostled to get access to iraq's vast oilfields after the u.s.-led invasion in 2003, they are increasingly focused on the energy transition and more profitable plays elsewhere. they also want better terms to develop fields, oil executives said.

china is among the biggest buyers of iraq's crude and chinese state firms have built up a dominant position in its oil industry.

but when lukoil notified the government last summer that it was considering selling some of its stake in west qurna 2 to sinopec, the oil minister intervened, people familiar with the matter said.

it has not previously been reported that sinopec was the potential buyer of lukoil's stake. the chinese company did not respond to a request for comment.

to encourage lukoil to stay, iraq offered a sweetener, a person with direct knowledge said.

a few months after lukoil signalled it was considering a sale, baghdad finally approved its plan to develop a field known as block 10, where the russian company had discovered an oil reservoir in 2017. afterwards, lukoil dropped the idea of selling its stake in west qurna 2, the source said.

lukoil did not respond to a request for comment.

bp and exxon
over the past few years bp has also spoken to the government about its options - including leaving iraq altogether - before settling on spinning off its stake in rumaila into a standalone company last year, two people familiar with the matter said.

oil minister abdul jabbar led efforts to convince bp not to leave as the government was concerned its partner in the field, china national petroleum corporation (cnpc), would buy bp's stake, the people said. baghdad was also keen to keep such a high-profile international oil major in the country, they said.

bp declined to comment.

when exxon flagged its intention to leave iraq in january 2021, meanwhile, u.s. officials told exxon they were unhappy with the prospect of the biggest u.s. oil major pulling out – for reasons that echoed iraqi concerns.

state department officials said exxon's departure could create a vacuum for chinese companies to fill, a person familiar with the conversations said.

u.s. officials then asked exxon what it would take to stay in iraq, the person said, declining to give further details.

a state department spokesperson said: ""we regularly engage with our iraqi counterparts on fostering an environment conducive to private sector investment.""

exxon had signed an agreement for the sale of its interest in west qurna 1 to cnooc and petrochina (601857.ss), the listed arm of cnpc, people familiar with the matter said.

neither cnooc nor cnpc responded to requests for comment about the deals.

exxon's stake was valued at $350 million to $375 million, said people familiar with the matter.

iraq has veto power over oilfield deals, however, and did not approve the transaction.

exxon filed for arbitration with the international chamber of commerce against basra oil co., arguing that it had followed the terms of its contract for west qurna 1 and had a good deal on the table, people familiar with the matter said.

the oil ministry then took the unusual step of trying to broker a deal on exxon's behalf. the ministry offered exxon's stake to other western companies including chevron corp (cvx.n).

no one was interested. rather than let the stake go to the chinese companies, baghdad said the state-run iraq national oil company (inoc) would take it instead, though inoc is still in the process of being revived after being defunct for many years.

""(exxon) will continue to work closely and constructively to reach an equitable resolution,"" said a spokeswoman.

service contracts
iraq's oil industry is mostly based on technical service contracts between the state-backed basra oil co. and foreign companies that are repaid costs plus a fee per barrel to develop fields, while iraq retains ownership of the reserves.

oil majors typically prefer deals that allow a share in profits rather than a set fee.

the priority for chinese firms, however, is achieving secure oil supplies to feed china's growing economy, rather than returns for investors, said a chinese oil executive with direct knowledge of cnpc's global investments.

there are some signs, however, that iraq is attempting to make its terms more appealing.

france's totalenergies (ttef.pa) signed a $27 billion deal in september that included payment of 40% of revenue from one field. the deal has stalled, however, due to disputes over terms and it still needs approval from some iraqi government agencies, reuters reported in february. read more

totalenergies said it was fully committed to the project.

one oil company executive said they were sceptical iraq would introduce more attractive terms. but unless they improve significantly, analysts say it is hard to imagine iraq will be able to stem the exodus as the energy transition accelerates.

""many of the energy majors are looking at the carbon emissions, their ability to generate cash flows if commodity prices are low, and they're looking at improving returns,"" said ian thom, research director at consultancy wood mackenzie.

""as the priorities of the energy companies are changing, the relative attractiveness of iraq is changing.""

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; houston/washington, may 24 (reuters) - the u.s. treasury department is getting ready to renew in the coming days chevron corp's [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) license to operate in venezuela, but likely without the greatly expanded terms the u.s. oil major sought, four people close to the talks said.
&gt; 
&gt; the last u.s. energy producer in venezuela asked president joe biden's government in march for a license that would allow it a greater say in its joint ventures with venezuela's state-run pdvsa, a first step to reviving output and controlling where oil is sent.
&gt; 
&gt; in a reversal of earlier hopes for a broadly expanded authorization, however, the license now is expected to be renewed as-is or returned to some of the terms it had in 2020, which did not limit chevron's drilling, processing or shipping oil from venezuela, according to the people. a final decision has not yet been made, one person familiar with the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; ##### register now for free unlimited access to reuters.com
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; washington last week gave chevron what it called a ""narrow"" authorization to engage in talks with president nicolas maduro's government on future activities. u.s. officials are now waiting for venezuela to put a date on resuming political dialogue with the government opposition, the people said, a possible determinant in crafting the chevron license.
&gt; 
&gt; the political talks, to be held in mexico, have yet to be formalized as the two sides debate which country will supervise, as norway did last year, two other people familiar with the matter said. the chevron license is set to expire on june 1.
&gt; 
&gt; ""we are no longer talking about the other issues,"" a source involved in the talks said, referring to chevron's pursuit of authority to take an operating role at its joint ventures and to bring venezuelan oil to the united states.
&gt; 
&gt; ## many pressures
&gt; 
&gt; as president biden's administration seeks to encourage the political dialogue, it has faced criticism from republicans as well as some of his fellow democrats who do not want to give maduro any concessions.
&gt; 
&gt; at the same time, the u.s. government is increasingly worried about rising fuel prices and fears of a lack of domestic supplies.
&gt; 
&gt; congressional opposition to any actions seen as relaxing sanctions have cut prospects for giving chevron at this time any control over production or a green light for trading, according to sources in washington.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. senator bob menendez, democratic chair of the foreign relations committee, last week said giving maduro ""a handful of undeserved handouts"" so his government would promise to sit down at a negotiating table was ""a strategy destined to fail.""
&gt; 
&gt; chevron, italy's eni [(eni.mi)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/eni.mi) and spain's repsol [(rep.mc)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/rep.mc) in recent years have sought u.s. authorizations to take venezuelan oil cargoes for repayment of past debt, arguing those terms would not provide cash to venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; between 2019 and 2020, chevron was allowed by the government of then president donald trump to trade crude produced by its venezuelan joint ventures to repay dividends and debt owed by pdvsa. the privileges were withdrawn as part of trump's pressure campaign against maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; “we are hopeful that general license 8 will be renewed so that we can continue our presence in the country for the long term,"" said chevron spokesman ray fohr. ""we remain committed to the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, the integrity of our joint venture assets, and the company’s social and humanitarian programs.”
&gt; 
&gt; pdvsa and the u.s. treasury did not reply to requests for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; washington in march surprisingly restarted diplomatic engagement with venezuela in a move to source oil to replace the russian crude and fuel that would be banned weeks later.
&gt; 
&gt; but after that high level meeting, u.s. officials have repeatedly said any sanctions relief for venezuela will be tied to ""concrete steps"" by maduro, highlighting the difficulties of each side getting at least a portion of demands on the table.
&gt; 
&gt; the united states recognizes opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela's rightful interim president, and regards maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham. but the socialist president remains in power.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. energy secretary jennifer granholm last week told a congressional hearing the government will not import crude from iran or venezuela.

1653407849,"i think you're over a year too late even three months ago, and now you're definitely too late.

for example about 16 months ago [i was pretty interested in the oil market since it looked like a lot of midcap energy players were getting cheap loans](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nemqxc/bcei_dd_no_moons_or_rockets_just_classic_dd_about/) on the strength that oil would be back to 100. smart loans = buy out some competitors = smart consolidation = money for investors. even at the time i was fairly certain i was late and i think the price mostly reflects that (+60% since my dd, but closer to +150% since their post-covid low).

today, after oil has been over 100 for months, i don't see it. you can go down the list the last seven or eight months: $oxy +150%, $mro +130%, xom +60%, cvx +60%. they're all priced expecting oil to go much higher than it is today.

like to take a random example: $repx. it's a classic west texas 'drop two or three well heads a year' type player in the permian basin. aka, in between marfa and alburquerque. do 39 employees and some wellheads based out of a brick building in nowhere, oklahoma deserve \~500 million market cap? all i know is if someone bought into those nonpreferred shares list as repx \~24 months ago they're cashing out, they're not going back in

i'm cutting back my oil plays apart from some midstream dividend plays because it's priced in.

[aapl was a different company back when it was trading with a pe in the mid teens. back then i was really conflicted whether i should invest and i didn't in the end because the moat and growth story wasn't clear to me. back then iphone sales were slowing and while people loved apple's products there was no real lock in or moat. it wasn't clear to me (or other investors) if apple was actually different or if they would just end up being the next nokia, motorola or blackberry.  today it's a lot harder for an iphone user to switch to android partly because of the software lock-ins but also because aapl has now built an ecosystem of services and hardware around the iphone. for example if you have an apple watch, airpods and backup everything to icloud you're almost certainly going to buy an iphone next year. i also think the iphone has stood the test of time at this point and they have developed far more brand loyalty than say nokia or motorola ever did.  another thing that's different about aapl today is that they're far more diversified. for a start they get about a quarter of their revenue from services today which is higher margin and stickier than hardware sales. they also get a significant proportion of revenues from wearables, which when combined with the growth in services means that iphone sales no longer make up the majority of aapl's sales. back when aapl was trading with a pe in the mid teens a bad year for iphone sales was a bad year for aapl, but today they can make up for slower iphone sales with other products and services.  finally, investors in aapl today no longer have to rely on continued top line growth because sometime in the late 2010s they started to redirect a huge amount of their cashflows into stock buybacks. while aapl's growth isn't likely ever be as high as it's been in the past you're still likely to see robust growth in aapl's share price going forward simply as a result of their large buyback programs.  i was quite critical of aapl's valuation earlier in the year, but their earnings so far this year have been much better than i expected and their share price has come down considerably since then. today if aapl is trading with a pe under 25 i think you can feel pretty safe owning it. that said, given market conditions i suspect it might still have room left to fall. i own a small position here and should aapl continue to fall i will be likely to add to it. it's not my favourite stock, it's a good stock if you're looking for a solid company that's likely to provide market-like returns for many years to come.](/r/stocks/comments/uw4tau/thoughts_on_apples_pe_ratio/i9qrs0r/)
