&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; - refiners contact oil firm, vessel owners to get in queue
&gt; - venezuela's state oil firm yet to schedule first cargo
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; houston, dec 1 (reuters) - u.s. oil refiners that once were regular buyers of venezuelan crude are jockeying to win access to coming cargoes chartered by chevron corp [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) under a newly issued u.s. license, two people familiar with the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; the biden administration last week authorized chevron to [expand operations in venezuela](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-issues-expanded-license-allow-chevron-import-venezuelan-petroleum-2022-11-26/) and resume taking prized heavy crude to the united states. it was first easing in more than three years of a u.s. ban on imports from the south american nation. a further relaxation may follow if caracas and opposition leaders agree on terms of a presidential election, washington has said.
&gt; 
&gt; valero energy corp [(vlo.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/vlo.n), pbf energy [(pbf.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/pbf.n) and citgo petroleum have shown interest in getting access to the oil chevron is expecting in coming weeks, according to the people.
&gt; 
&gt; valero, pbf and pdvsa did not reply to requests for comment. a chevron spokesperson said it does not comment on commercial matters. a spokesperson for citgo declined to comment.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuelan heavy crude grades, popular among u.s. refiners for producing products from asphalt to motor fuels, had been partially replaced by russian supplies in the aftermath of sanctions on venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; some of these companies this week began contacting chevron, shipping agencies and vessel owners to check timetables, the sources added. [no venezuelan oil officially has been allocated](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chevron-awaits-venezuelan-oil-cargoes-pdvsa-wants-payments-2022-11-28/) to chevron yet and no chartering contracts have been signed to transport cargoes to the united states, according to venezuelan export schedules and refinitiv freight data.
&gt; 
&gt; ## eager refiners
&gt; 
&gt; the most recent chartering contracts to transport venezuelan oil to the u.s. gulf coast are from late 2018, right before sanctions, the refinitiv data showed.
&gt; 
&gt; valero, pbf and other u.s. independent refiners would not need any new authorization to buy venezuelan oil from chevron. but citgo, owned by venezuela's pdvsa, may require clearance from the u.s. treasury department since it operates under a license, analysts and experts said.
&gt; 
&gt; chevron could prioritize its own refineries, especially pascagoula, mississippi, and el segundo, california, which were regular receivers of venezuela oil in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; on thursday, [chevron ceo michael wirth said](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-ceo-expects-gradual-relaxation-us-sanctions-venezuela-2022-12-01/) the company is not likely to add investment to boost venezuela's output in the next six months as the sanctions framework will take time to be eased. the primary effect will be to allow some venezuelan oil to flow back to the united states, ""which will help the u.s. refining system,"" wirth said.
&gt; 
&gt; a total lifting of sanctions is unlikely in the near term, said analysts, but venezuela's former customers, its business partners and creditors are taking steps to collect pending debts in the wake of the chevron authorization. washington has not signaled it would authorize other companies to collect on those debts.
&gt; 
&gt; ## road to exports
&gt; 
&gt; because spring and summer in the united states are the most active seasons for asphalt paving and peak driving, venezuela's heavy boscan crude produced by chevron and pdvsa at their petroboscan project could be the first exported.
&gt; 
&gt; to restart those shipments, dredging maracaibo lake's navigation channel might be needed to allow panamax and aframax tankers reach venezuela's western oil terminals, shipping sources said.
&gt; 
&gt; a glut of boscan crude in storage earlier this year forced a total shutdown of its processing. draining those stocks must come first to restart output, pdvsa documents showed.
&gt; 
&gt; there are separate stocks of hamaca oil and diluted crude for immediate export at the nation's largest terminal. but as of nov. 29, there were only 1.47 million barrels available, enough for only two cargoes, according to the pdvsa documents.
&gt; 
&gt; petropiar's crude upgrader, operated by pdvsa and chevron, was halted last week over a naphtha leak. it restarted days later to produce about 100,000 barrels per day of hamaca.
&gt; 
&gt; in november, pdvsa sent 1.2 million barrels of hamaca to its refineries for processing. about 1 million barrels of fuel oil were also shipped from petropiar to iran's state firm naftiran intertrade co ltd (nico) as part of an oil swap, the documents showed.

trading thesis : tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials  helps to narrow down moving tickers  
fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.   
i look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less that 500 million.   
the shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used ( or shares traded). that information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.   
things to consider when finding the plays-   
\* if the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, i will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.   
\* if the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, i would consider it for a long play. if trading less than the movement of the ticker, i would consider a short or put play.  ( if all the other factors previously mentioned checks out. )   
\* the trades are researched afternoon daily  to find possible tickers making a big move.",3,,Badboyardie,0

&gt; # [venezuelan officials, chevron execs hold closed-door meetings](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/hveefec7eottjk9s-z3dufrne1y=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80\)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/iyfy2dvsrvpmfcngohgq4g5kzi.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; houston/caracas, dec 7 (reuters) - venezuelan officials and executives from u.s. oil company chevron corp [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) held a private meeting on wednesday at one of their joint ventures to discuss operations and management, but workers were left out, three sources close to the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; in november, the u.s. treasury department issued a license to chevron to expand operations in venezuela, part of washington's effort to encourage talks between president nicolas maduro and the opposition toward an election in 2023. the u.s. government called maduro's 2018 re-election a sham.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela's oil minister, tareck el aissami, president of state company pdvsa, asdrubal chavez, and the head of chevron's venezuela unit, javier la rosa, [had planned this week to address](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-pdvsa-chevron-address-joint-venture-workers-after-license-2022-12-06/)workers of the four joint ventures shared by pdvsa and chevron, to communicate operational and management changes following the u.s. license, sources close to the preparations said.
&gt; 
&gt; the first meeting with workers was planned to be held at joint venture petropiar in the orinoco belt oil region. but after last-minute changes to the agenda, executives and officials opted for a closed-door encounter.
&gt; 
&gt; the second of those private meetings is planned for thursday at the site of the petroboscan joint venture in western venezuela, two of the sources added.
&gt; 
&gt; a chevron spokesperson declined to comment, citing a policy of not commenting on commercial matters.
&gt; 
&gt; pdvsa did not immediately reply to requests for comment. it was unclear whether new general managers at some joint ventures were appointed, as planned.
&gt; 
&gt; joint-venture employees, who are paid by pdvsa according to venezuelan laws, are expected to continue working under the same terms, a situation that has infuriated some union leaders who claim the staff needs higher salaries amid hyperinflation and devaluation in venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; pdvsa and chevron are in talks to expand benefits and encourage better performance at facilities, especially at the petropiar upgrader, which is expected to supply heavy crude to the united states, the sources said.

if more people were diversified, than they could have sold some $xom or $bp stock when they needed the cash or if they wanted to take profits in 2022.  but unfortunately too many retail stock holders bought all the same stocks in the same sectors.  they don't own any of the market outperformers like $cat, $de, $mcd, etc. so there is a real possibility that we will get one more huge move down in the tech stocks as retail stock holders capitulate and just sell everything.",3,,drew-gen-x,0

1672202627,"&gt;1. it is foolish to invest in a company that is facing negative eps growth. $ati is a much better choice, as it is expected to have positive eps growth in the coming year.

2. $qcom and $boot are both risky bets, as they are highly dependent on the continued success of their respective businesses (smartphones and cowboy boots). i would avoid these two stocks unless you are confident that their businesses will continue to do well.

3.$cat and $slb are both safer choices, as they operate in more stable industries (manufacturing and oil &amp; gas). however, neither stock is expected to see significant growth in the near future, so you may want to consider other options if you're looking for capital appreciation potential.",1,,VisualMod,0

i‚Äôm remember cathie woods (worst hedge fund manager ever) and a few other parading tesla earlier this year saying tesla is ‚Äúundervalued and it will hit $4,000 by 2023‚Äù (or some shit along the lines)‚Ä¶ no company or business entity even governments are gonna get out of inflation‚Ä¶ petty much the economy is overvalued in a sense where prices are collapsing and overall equites are diminishing‚Ä¶

i honestly just put stock alerts and plan to slowly add them to my portfolio:
$amzn bottom entry target $65 
$aapl i‚Äôm thinking $100 maybe $80 (but that‚Äôs seems high improbable)
$goog anywhere between $70 - $50
$msft seems to performing well compared to others $170 is my entry (but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go that low)
$tsla for me looks well at $75 - $50

honestly there‚Äôs no telling how low a company can go or even the chances of it to go there, always nice to have entry point set in mind so if the opportunity arises you can invest‚Ä¶ but so far all gas/oil stocks are performing well with no drop in market vaule, in fact $xom $oxy $cvx $shel along with a few retailers $jnj $wmt $pg $cost $hd $ko $pep $unh are still out performing the rest of the market‚Ä¶ some have recovered from previous dips and others are still not affected‚Ä¶.

it‚Äôs all a fugazi, if someone‚Äôs losing in one corner there‚Äôs going to be someone winning in the other, you just have to fluctuate and focus on where the money is going and how much potential does that company have‚Ä¶ buy low sell high‚Ä¶ unfortunately for tsla ‚Äúbag holders‚Äù elon convinced most of his followers/fans (who think they experts on ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù) plung a shit ton of money into overvalued shares and now they‚Äôre stuck and reluctant to sell‚Ä¶ he probably had keen idea of the future dip and just baited morons to buy into an overvalued company‚Ä¶ and now they all get defensive about tsla

as traders you shouldn‚Äôt be defending a company or its reputation, you should simply focus on the potential outs, of buy low and sell high, not buy when a rich asshole tweets to buy‚Ä¶ as traders we have no obligation or any loyalty to any company we invest in. we should simply rely on the idea and strategy of receiving the best outputs of our money‚Ä¶ and defending controversial ceo‚Äôs is just idiotic, they don‚Äôt know us (general public) nor do they give or ever will 2 shits about us",11,,Particular-Ad-3411,0
