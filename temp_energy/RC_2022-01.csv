i always thought alt l1 narratives were best when eth was working through scaling. if you think that narrative is still valid then go for it, but i got scared off when i started to figure the large vc allocations most of them have(who will sell at some point!) , and with l2s finally gaining traction, that window seemed to be closing to me. not to mention how they really don't care about being decentralized or even progress towards being more decentralized. 
  
its too early to say 100% but a successful merge and l2 maintaining their current paths, i think eth cements it's self as the dominant l1 for the next 20 to 30 years. it just has that big of a head start/proven history, network effect, evm moat.
  
edit: it also seems like there are too many l1s now, nothing to really to concentrate value into, to outperform eth. if i was trying to outperform eth it would be with $cvx and $fxs, i expect one or both of these to be in top 20 at some point in 2022 (small allocations like 1% to max like 5% of your total eth, eth is a way safer bet)",5,,unthinkablecryto,0

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; almaty, jan 5 (reuters) - kazakh president kassym-jomart tokayev has declared a two-week state of emergency in the central asian nation's biggest city almaty and in the western mangistau province where protests turned violent, his office said early on wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; the move includes an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew, movement restrictions, and a ban on mass gatherings, according to documents published on the president's website.
&gt; 
&gt; ""calls to attack government and military offices are absolutely illegal,"" tokayev said in a video address a few hours earlier. ""the government will not fall, but we want mutual trust and dialogue rather than conflict.""

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; as he spoke, police in almaty used tear gas and stun grenades to stop hundreds of protesters from storming the mayor's office, a reuters correspondent reported from the scene.
&gt; 
&gt; the oil-rich country's government announced late on tuesday it was restoring some price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, after the rare protests reached almaty following a sharp rise in the price of the fuel at the start of the year.
&gt; 
&gt; many kazakhs have converted their cars to run on lpg, which is far cheaper than gasoline as a vehicle fuel in kazakhstan because of price caps. but the government argued that the low price was unsustainable and lifted the caps on jan. 1.
&gt; 
&gt; price spike
&gt; 
&gt; after the price of the fuel spiked, rallies involving thousands of people erupted on jan. 2 in the town of zhanaozen, an oil hub and site of deadly clashes between protesters and police a decade ago.
&gt; 
&gt; demonstrations spread to other parts of surrounding mangistau province and western kazakhstan, including provincial centre aktau and a worker camp used by sub-contractors of kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, tengizchevroil. the chevron-led [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) venture said output had not been affected.
&gt; 
&gt; in almaty, police appeared to have taken control of the main square shortly after deploying flashbang grenades, according to online video streams from the area. but explosions were heard for hours on nearby streets and in other parts of the city.
&gt; 
&gt; videos published online showed torched police cars in the city, as well as armoured vehicles moving through one of its main thoroughfares.
&gt; 
&gt; on tuesday evening, the government announced it was restoring the price cap of 50 tenge (11 cents) per litre, or less than half the market price, in mangistau province.
&gt; 
&gt; public protests are illegal in the country of 19 million unless their organisers file a notice in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; tokayev, the hand-picked successor of soviet-era communist boss nursultan nazarbayev who stepped down in 2019, faces no political opposition in parliament.
&gt; 
&gt; the president said on twitter on tuesday that he would hold a government meeting the following day to discuss the protesters' demands. he urged protesters to behave responsibly.

[you and the people/companies that will not invest in oil companies are a big reason why oil company stocks will have a higher return.   look at it this way, assume everyone everywhere sells all the shares and refused to buy them,  except the management of oil companies.   yes, the price of the stock would go down to near $0.  however,  the business is still very profitable. the people who spent very little money to buy the stock will get all the money from those profits.   a lot of this has already happened,  giant pension funds have divested from oil,  esg funds aren't buying any oil stocks,  you personally aren't buying any.  that's been keeping the stock price low. all of the valuation metrics for xom are amazing (fwd pe, price per fcf, ev/ebitda).    if you think a company is unethical, you hurt the company by not buying the product.   if enough people do that then profits go to zero.     heck, if a business is  profitable selling unethical products, the ethical thing to do is to buy the stock to keep its executives from getting all the money!](/r/stocks/comments/rztcim/why_im_long_oil/hry14xr/)

[the big established companies rarely sell stocks to fund new projects and exxonmobil share count is down a huge amount since 2006, it went up in 2011 and it looks like they stopped buying shares in 2018 but the share count hasn't gone up much. my guess is that's when they saw the writing on the wall and began self financing projects from cash flow.   it's already getting harder for them to get loans,  but exxonmobil xom bonds look like they are rated aa2 which i think is really good and they say they are committed to only starting new projects with a double digit return on capital.  i don't know how bond rating is influenced by share price so i don't know if that would change.   i would think it would stay the same based on profits expected to be able to repay,  but that's only because that's what they look at to make me a loan and i don't know the details of corporate finance or how it's different.   you're right about stock based compensation,  but that was just paying people a different way.  give employees stock at the same time the company is buying back stock.   it's simpler to just pay people more money (and i think the employees prefer that too).  the downside is less incentive alignment,  but that can be fixed with bonus structure.   all of what you said is important for would be competition.   i would agree that buying stock of an unethical startup in an initial public offering would be bad, but for the established companies the harder it is to start a competing company the more profitable they will be!   i'm 100% on board with not buying unethical products and i do want i can to avoid them when possible.   for example the last time i logged into facebook was 2012, we buy a lot of food from local farmers,  i bought a hybrid car that gets really good mileage.  when it comes to investing however,  i really believe that it has zero ethical implications from owning the stock.](/r/stocks/comments/rztcim/why_im_long_oil/hrygq9l/)

[maybe.  50 years is a long time, in the 70s i would have never predicted that sears   would go under while mcdonalds and walmart continued to be outstanding investments. besides, i can sell whenever i think the stock price will stop going up faster than other options.  it's an investment, not a romantic relationship.  right now i think xom, su, and cve will continue to outperform because they have huge amounts of free cash flow.   i've been wrong about stocks before and i'm confident i'll be wrong again at some point.  &amp;#x200b;  the esg movement hasn't done anything except make these investments more attractive.  thats why private investment companies are buying all the dirty parts of businesses from the public companies. i had some bhp billiton for a while, and they kept selling the coal mines and oil.  i remember reading about one of the big people (larry fink?) who's been pushing esg was worried about it since the private investment firms were ramping up coal production instead of slowing operations and there weren't any shareholders to push back.](/r/stocks/comments/rztcim/why_im_long_oil/hryqqhb/)

so $cvx holders get the brides, and anyone that locks up $fxs or $crv with convex is giving up that voting power.

$crv is the token lps receive. you can lock $crv for 4 years to get vecrv which gives you governance rights and ability to vote to direct future $crv emissions. 

$cvx is a wrapper built on top of $crv to control it in a liquid fashion. you are basically getting governance over curve without locking up your $crv for 4 years.

i like both. and i'd recommend a 50:50 split between $crv (which you can convert and stake as $cvxcrv on convex for a share of curve's fees + $crv rewards) and $cvx (which you can use to vote for protocols in exchange for 'bribes' in their native tokens).",1,,gand_ji,0

so i respect those that are trying to play a boom and i guess they somehow know how to sell when the boom comes near an end. i totally get it...but since its not sustainable over the long term - 10 years its not something i‚Äôd get into.

1643324026,"there are others, all blue chips that i have no reason to tout or promote. occasionally i will cite when a large cap makes a momentous technical move, such as what $amzn did recently when its 50 dma crossed its 200 dma. very bearish, imo. i did trim back my xom stock because i think it's only going up because of geopolitical tensions. overall, the demand for fossil fuel is steadily diminishing and with #xom paying 4-5% dividends for a stock - yet only last year was considering reducing its dividends - to me is too risky to hold too much longer. i sold about 80% of my xom. but it could go higher, but i'm happy with current levels where i sold it. i purchased other blue chip stocks with those funds, but i would prefer to keep that private. 

mj stocks are hi-beta and are quite risky, but should eventually offer great returns. what is needed is some strong fundamental news - probably coming from congress or the president, before mj stocks launch. i've been using technical indicators, but i have been getting hammered every time i get buy signals.

with that said, many mj stocks are at 52-week or near all-time lows. i wish i had not loaded up on the way down. so i'm hurting as much as the next guy, maybe more. but i am holding strong. at some point, this will turn around.",1,,GroundbreakingLynx14,0

it's fucking insane to me that congress, which controls a 3 trillion dollar budget and makes decisions that can alter the fate of entire companies, has basically no conflict of interest rules applied to them. wife's on the board of directors for major defense contractor? sure, you can vote on their $100 billion dollar contract! oh, you own 50,000 shares of stock in a major hospital group? no problem, you can totally sit on the medicare oversight committee! recently learned classified intel that opec is gonna cut oil production 20% next month? yes, you can totally go buy a shitload of chevron stock before that info goes public!

1643673017,"excellent analysis.  i will be honest the only reason i own $bp over shell is i couldn't decide which of the 2 different shares to own the a or b so i just went with $bp for my non usa oil position.  i realize that is a dumb reason.  although i do own $shlx so it's possible shell might buy that back like $psx is buying $psxp back and converting them into $psx shares. 

i also stayed away from $xom and $cvx because as you stated shell has a footprint in the gasoline service stations.  i went with $psx and $bp for the same reason.  i don't think it's farfetched that shell, bp, and phillips 66 can modify some of their gasoline stations into ev charging stations in the future.  the investment and infrastructure is already there. 

the carbon capture is going to be huge.  i just don't know enough about how it will work for an opinion.  

i also agree with the natural gas becoming a huge revenue driver in oil companies with natural gas and pipelines  as  crude oil is i don't want to say phased out, but maybe the increase in yoy demand lowers.  again a reason i bought phillips 66 over $xom and $cvx.  another reason why i would buy shell over them as well.  

very good analysis and it's much appreciated. thanks",4,,drew-gen-x,0
