exxon last year employed more than 1,000 people across russia with offices in moscow, st. petersburg, yekaterinburg and yuzhno-sakhalinst, according to its website.  
the company operates three large offshore oil and gas fields with operations based on sakhalin island. the number of expatriate staff being evacuated was unclear on tuesday.  
an exxon spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment.  
the company, which has been developing its russian oil and gas fields since 1995, has come under pressure to cut its ties with russia over the country's invasion of ukraine. this week, rivals bp plc, shell plc and equinor halted or disclosed plans to exit russian investments or halt operations.  
the sakhalin facilities, which exxon has operated since production began in 2005, represents one of the largest single direct investments in russia, according to its website. the operation has pumped up to 300,000 barrels per day of oil and gas.",153,,egeym,0

1646164545,"houston, march 1 (reuters) - chevron corp (cvx.n) chief executive officer michael wirth on tuesday expressed concern over the ""tragic situation"" unfolding in ukraine, forcing oil companies to make ""very difficult decisions"" on continued operations in russia.  


  
wirth touched on the growing awareness of the need for additional oil and gas supplies, worries over cyberattacks against the oil industry and rapidly rising fuel prices in remarks to wall street analysts and reporters.  


  
the company's annual investor outlook came as oil markets were rattled by russia's attacks on ukraine andrivals bp plc , shell plc and equinor (eqnr.ol) halting or abandoningrussian business ventures and investments.  


&amp;#x200b;

  
chevron is one of the ""least exposed"" among the oil majors to russia risk, according to allen good, an analyst with morningstar equity research firm.  


  
a globally coordinated release of oil reserves could help ease supply concerns and cool crude price hikes, wirth said.  


  
major oil-consuming nations on tuesday agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves as oil futures jumped more than 9% to trade near $107 per barrel. read more  


&amp;#x200b;

  
long-term energy security  


  
the united states is revisiting its stance on new domestic oil production, the chevron ceo signaled, referring to recent talks with the u.s. government that had focused on climate concerns and limiting carbon emissions.  


  
""we have a lot of common ground,"" wirth said, declining to discuss specific conversations. ""in the early months, i wish there had been more dialogue.""  


&amp;#x200b;

  
achieving long-term energy security for the united states would include an ""attitude to support investment"" in oil production growth, wirth said.  


  
""nobody knows how long the situation will endure,"" he said.  


  
chevron on tuesday reiterated plans to raise output in the u.s. permian shale basin by 10% in 2022 and expand production there to more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the coming years, from 681,000 bpd in the fourth quarter.  


  
its permian production could grow to between 1.2-1.5 million bpd, the company said at a corporate presentation, without specifying a timeframe to achieve it.  


  
while the company has ""a lot of running room in the permian,"" a decision to further expand production will be based on profitability, wirth said.  


&amp;#x200b;

  
cybersecurity costs  
the oil major has been increasing spending on cybersecurity as the industry faces increased threats of hacker attacks to operations.  


  
""we are in a high-risk environment right now from a cyber standpoint,"" wirth said. ""we are an industry that is a high-profiled, high-value target for bad actors.""  


  
wirth said chevron is less exposed to sanctions on russia than many of its rivals.  


  
""a number of other companies had to take very difficult decisions. we have very little exposure to russia as a company, but these are very difficult decisions to be made,"" he told cnbc.  


  
he stressed the importance for world oil supply of the caspian pipeline consortium (cpc), operator of a oil line that moves crude from russia and kazakhstan and in which chevron holds a 15% interest.  


  
chevron is relying on added production from kazakhstan and the permian basin to raise its output by more than 3% per year through 2026.  


&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

  
the pipeline exported 1.1 million bpd of crude from kazakhstan and 200,000 bpd from russia in 2021.  
""it is an important source supply"" the world ""really needs"" right now,"" wirth said.  


  
but buyers have been avoiding its oil in recent days due to sanctions over russia, reuters reported. read more  


  
chevron also has a 50% stake in tengizchevroil (tco), which is developing the tengiz and korolev crude oil fields in western kazakhstan.  


  
""we have had no indications from any government that operations of the caspian pipeline consortium are likely to be interrupted,"" wirth said. ""beyond the caspian pipeline, we really have no other exposure to russia and none to ukraine.""",3,,egeym,0

&gt; london, march 1 (reuters) - the cpc pipeline that ships 1.2% of the world's oil from kazakhstan to global markets has been caught in russian sanctions problems in recent days as buyers avoid its oil because of mixture with russian grades and loadings from a russian port, traders said.
&gt; 
&gt; five traders, who spoke with reuters on condition of anonymity, said buyers have been avoiding cpc for delivery in late march.
&gt; 
&gt; they said cpc exports oil from russia's novorossiisk port and mixes it with russian grades, which deterred most buyers and made it difficult to find insurance for the ships.

[exactly. and even better, even if people don't immediately decide they want to switch to an ev, these ridiculous oil prices will get many people to calculate the costs of owning an ev and realise that on top of saving money on gas, you also save thousands of dollars a year on price depreciation, maintenance, tax and regulatory inspections (depending on where you live), etc.  many people still don't realise that a $40k second hand ev is less expensive over a 1 or 5 year ownership than a $10k ice car if you sell it at the end, assuming you drive at least 10,000 miles a year. this can even go up to $50-60k if you drive a lot.](/r/stocks/comments/t4nx6s/flashback_to_cathie_wood_in_2020_i_believe_that/hz13oph/)

[luxury evs don‚Äôt have a much lower carbon footprint than small, efficient ice cars. also, they require more electric power generation, which is mostly coal &amp; natural gas generated. guess what my highest performing energy stock is. hint: it‚Äôs not an oil company. it‚Äôs $btu, a coal company. compare $btu to $xom or $cvx.  the energy crisis wasn‚Äôt caused by russia‚Äôs invasion. that just spiked the prices some in the past couple of weeks. this energy crunch has been building for a while, and it‚Äôs not just oil](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyzmsa9/)

[i don‚Äôt see rising gas prices as a *practical* cost problem.  in this us people spend 20 minutes in line at costco to save a couple bucks worth of gas, then proceed to drive 90 mph down the highway to ‚Äúsave time.‚Äù  while driving their boxy suvs and trucks with lift kits and knobby tires which are getting like 9 mpg.  so, high gas prices are more of a marketing problem. people are going to be constantly talking about high gas prices, evs will get hyped, and it will start to squeeze traditional ice car manufacturers, which will further create frenzied buying of evs.  there‚Äôs also going to be the ‚Äúenergy independence‚Äù discussion coming back online over the next handful of years.  evs (especially domestic made) will be a cornerstone of bipartisan energy independence legislation.  gas prices won‚Äôt stay high forever.  i‚Äôd be trying to find the lasting changes that will stem from them vs chasing the trend.](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyxhc50/)

[&gt; only evs that are 40k plus have that type of range.  today yes, but batteries are getting more range for a lower price.  &gt; until you can buy an ev for the same price as a base civic or focus and it has 400 mile range, evs will continue to chip away at a 1% or 2% increase of market share per year.  that will never be the case and is not a realistic requirement for multiple reasons.  for one, evs are much cheaper to own. in the order of thousands of dollars a year cheaper. a $10,000 second hand ice car is comparable in costs to a $50,000 brand new ev if you include all costs over a few years time of ownership.  on top of that, by 2030 ice cars will be roughly twice as expensive as they are today due to inflation, increasing technology costs and reducing economies of scale. meanwhile evs will likely stay roughly the same price, despite inflation and while getting much better specs.  &gt; people aren't all of the sudden going to be able to afford tesla's and audi's because gas prices are high  no, but people who can't afford good evs will just be buying cars on the second hand market. when we talk about ev adoption we're talking exclusively about new car sales.  also keep in mind that many people lease and or have a loan for their cars, so sticker price isn't always the only thing people see when buying a car. right now lease prices are still very high because of the excess demand, or in other words because they can, but once supply catches up they're gonna come down in price fast.  &gt; and as evs gain marketshare, gas prices drop and ice cars get cheaper, slowing the transition.  the opposite is actually true. running fuel stations will become much more expensive as fewer cars need them to stop for gas, so the overhead will start playing a bigger role. even if reduced demand might lower prices, they will probably cancel each other out at best.  &gt; you're also forgetting that those cars would have to be produced. you need to replace the entire north american fleet of vehicles before oil demand really gets hit. that's a massive challenge on its own.  again no, when we're talking about ev adoption we're talking about % of sales, not % of cars on the road.](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyy2tyj/)

[good job man.  i‚Äôm not sure how closely look at their earnings reports but sm has about 50% of their oil hedged for 2022. ‚Äî meaning that they‚Äôre having to sell 50% of the oil that they will produce this year at $51.35. (this is because of crappy hedges that they took on during the pandemic) the hedges that they had in place for 2021 were even worse. my point is - even though the company is doing very well, they will practically be printing their own money towards the end of this year when they get away from these bad hedges.  also- i appreciate the recommendation on cdev but i‚Äôm already in deep on apa, oxy, bp, slb and others.](/r/stockmarket/comments/t4uwal/ukraine_conflict_oil_hits_110_a_barrel_despite/hz4e5qo/)

[still plenty of upside in oil prices; dont listen to these amateurs here who see charts goin up and think theyre way smarter for staying away. oil to 200$ easy‚Ä¶.   i like $oxy personally, its been beaten down more than other oil producers for their debt load they accrued over the last couple of years. they also operate chemical and natgas businesses alongside their shale oil business. if oil can sustain current prices for a bit of time, oxy‚Äôs debt load is small pennies compared to the cash they would print at these levels‚Ä¶. much room to run. during periods of higher oil prices oxy was a monster stock in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. it trades for 48 today. they also announced buybacks and tender offerings too.   positions: 5 $40c 4/1, 10 50c 6/17. might add shares too](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t526h2/oil_is_about_to_go_through_the_damn_ceiling/hz3xxzr/)

[yes just keep practicing. the best thing is to actually use real money because your money is on the line &amp; therefore you tend to be cautious as fuck. you can also buy an option for a company otm incase it misses and the loss is minor or itm &amp; just ride the iv up until earnings and sell right before for a profit. this way you never have to worry about earnings going bad.   i don‚Äôt know what app you use, but on thinkorswim there‚Äôs a tab you press that literally says ‚Äúclose position‚Äù under the positions tab. once you click positions &amp; close position it automatically pulls up your position and you just sell at the ‚Äúmid‚Äù or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù price. it‚Äôs usually a few cent difference. you can also just call your broker and they‚Äôll sell for you for a fee of $25 or less depending on the broker. sometimes free if you say ask them to waive it. i always call my broker to do it but only because i don‚Äôt have the time to during my office hours.   play a stock like costco or some other shit you feel comfortable w &amp; risk a little money. also if you mess up the option (it doesn‚Äôt go your way) you can still sell it back and salvage some of the money. like you could risk $500 &amp; miss, then sell and get back $270 (random numbers i‚Äôm making up)   hope this helps &amp; good luck. remember to just feel it out and don‚Äôt play shit that even gives you the slightest bad feeling (unless it‚Äôs just basic nervousness).   also look into staddles &amp; strangles. pretty handy, especially on spy or options you aren‚Äôt sure about.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t1wq7f/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/hz1fy9r/)

[let's look at what happened 2018 when the fed most recently hiked rates.  the dumping commenced in october. then kangaroo market/wild volatility in november. then massive dumping in december as the final hike brought rates to 2.25-2.5% reversing a few days later into a magnificent v shaped recovery.  so let's pretend that the stock market will behave exactly the same this time around. using a \~three month timeline, we're somewhere in that month of kangaroo market with a month of even more dumping looming on the horizon. obviously things are a bit different this time, 2018 was china trade war and trump tweeting trade talks going well every other day, while 2022 we've got covid, inflation and a potentially horrific european land war on our hands.  anyways 2018 saw 6% swings up, down, up, down multiple times in the weeks of november. so while it does seem like we've got more room to drop, we're still in that kangaroo period and volatility this time is even more extreme, so be careful getting jacked to the tits on puts because the market could easily run up to 457 before dumping again.  thanks for coming to my ted talk. i have 420p for 3/7 and 3/16.  tl;dr market may go up or down, mods are gay](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t5a2q1/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_march_03_2022/hz58cy2/)

[if this is tracking slaughter cattle, three companies have a stranglehold on 85% of the slaughter capacity.  if feed costs go up, it costs feedlots more money to feed and finish those cattle.  knowing that they dont have any control over the price they receive from the packers, their only option is to offer lower prices for the incoming cattle and hope that the packers won't pay less, or contract those cattle for sale at the same time they purchase them and the feed so they lock in some profit.   a pen of subcontracted, finished cattle is a huge liability because the it costs the feedlot somewhere in the $2/head/day to feed those cattle.  so a pen of 250 head would be $500/day.  once they have reache'd target finished weight, the packers can start to apply a penalty for oversized or overfinished cattle that create more waste in the cutting-room.  if you don't understand the beef business from cow-calf to plate, you should not play w cattle futures.  i work in all aspects of it and would only use futures to hedge actual cattle i'm raising or buying to resell.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t56axc/missed_weat_and_corn_have_a_cow/hz31p5m/)

[&gt; only evs that are 40k plus have that type of range.  today yes, but batteries are getting more range for a lower price.  &gt; until you can buy an ev for the same price as a base civic or focus and it has 400 mile range, evs will continue to chip away at a 1% or 2% increase of market share per year.  that will never be the case and is not a realistic requirement for multiple reasons.  for one, evs are much cheaper to own. in the order of thousands of dollars a year cheaper. a $10,000 second hand ice car is comparable in costs to a $50,000 brand new ev if you include all costs over a few years time of ownership.  on top of that, by 2030 ice cars will be roughly twice as expensive as they are today due to inflation, increasing technology costs and reducing economies of scale. meanwhile evs will likely stay roughly the same price, despite inflation and while getting much better specs.  &gt; people aren't all of the sudden going to be able to afford tesla's and audi's because gas prices are high  no, but people who can't afford good evs will just be buying cars on the second hand market. when we talk about ev adoption we're talking exclusively about new car sales.  also keep in mind that many people lease and or have a loan for their cars, so sticker price isn't always the only thing people see when buying a car. right now lease prices are still very high because of the excess demand, or in other words because they can, but once supply catches up they're gonna come down in price fast.  &gt; and as evs gain marketshare, gas prices drop and ice cars get cheaper, slowing the transition.  the opposite is actually true. running fuel stations will become much more expensive as fewer cars need them to stop for gas, so the overhead will start playing a bigger role. even if reduced demand might lower prices, they will probably cancel each other out at best.  &gt; you're also forgetting that those cars would have to be produced. you need to replace the entire north american fleet of vehicles before oil demand really gets hit. that's a massive challenge on its own.  again no, when we're talking about ev adoption we're talking about % of sales, not % of cars on the road.](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyy2tyj/)

[% of new car sales doesnt paint the appropriate picture when talking about gasoline demand, you need to look at ev penetration in the whole fleet. remember that even if 50% of new cars sold were evs, that still means 50% of new cars sold are ice cars that will be in the fleet for a decade or more.  to your other point, no one who can only afford a 3 year old civic, which is the majority of car owners today, is going to look at a 50k ev and justify it to themselves because the maintenance costs are lower when they can buy a new civic for 30k less and have a 6 year warranty. also in what world are maintenance costs and the difference between gasoline and electricity costs equalling $40,000 over the life of a car? your numbers dont make sense.   lastly, there is no such thing as a gasoline death spiral, stop getting all of your materials from ev publications lol. thats not how refining fuel works. diesel demand isn't going anywhere, absolutely no progress has been made in replacing diesel in our energy mix. that means we will be producing diesel long term and when you produce diesel you make gasoline, so that means that if evs take over, that makes gasoline a cheap byproduct. refiners aren't just going to dispose of it, they will market it and sell it. sure, they might consolidate gas stations but gasoline will not be 4 dollars a gallon when demand drops. thats not how refining works.](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyy6cwz/)

[you're forgetting about price depreciation. evs don't just have fewer maintenance, but - and especially teslas and mercedes evs - also way less price depreciation. to the point of 50% less. if you drive a $10k ice car for 5 years, it's gonna lose about 50-70% of its remaining value. meanwhile the new tesla loses about 35% of its value, so you're still selling it for round $35k. so now you only have a $10k-12k gap to fill with gas, maintenance, road tax, etc.  just checked my calculations again and i should note i didn't calculate much cost for energy. just supercharging a few times a year and charging at home from solar for the rest, so you'd realistically need to calculate some costs for that since you'd need more solar panels with an ev. then i only used 10k miles per year, so for people driving a lot it'll be even more extreme.  either way, even if it's comparable to a $30k ev, that still means you can't call a $50k ev more expensive than a $40k ice car.](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyyk60q/)

$oxy / cl=f if you want to hedge against short term violent price moves. 
with futures contracts $50k minimum, and you have delivery risk (2020 covid) so if you can‚Äôt afford storage for it or storage prices &gt; crude you get negative crude prices. 

some people suggested $enb, but the correlation is less conducive to crude futures there but you do you.

if you‚Äôre purely looking to ‚Äúhedge‚Äù- then consider your fuel costs for ~ 1year. 

then buy something equating to roughly 1year of fuel costs let‚Äôs say $2000. then everytime you fill up $200, sell $200 of the underlying assets. 

commercial manufacturing use natural gas swaps / futures to hedge against rising cost. (eg. you make cars, want to ensure that if steel/alum prices rocket you are still able to make your cars and sell it to end consumer without raising end costs too much to change consumer behaviour).",1,,dancinadventures,0
1646432050,"crazy week, i initiated 16 spreads and exited 8 of them for profit. i did a good job of balancing my portfolio based on changing market conditions but the uncertainty of each day made me close my failing positions early and open new positions going with the market trend. 

of the 8 failed trades, 3 positions ($unp cds, $c pds, $ms pds) could have been closed for breakeven and a further 3 positions  ($tsm pds, $x cds, $clf cds) could have been closed at maximum profit if i simply held for longer. this would have pushed my success rate from 50% to 87%. 

of the 8 the profitable trades. 4 trades were closed early ($rrc cds, $rcl pds, $ual pds, $trip pds) that could have been closed for maximum profit. the remaining 4 trades were closed extremely close to maximum profit to generate funds for additional trades. 

of the 8 failed trades, 2 trades ($ip pds, and $cvx cds made halfway through today) were genuine analysis mistakes on my part and were incorrect reads on the market. i'm particularly disappointed in myself for making the $cvx cds as i sold my $cvx pds i got this morning for profit and got a little trigger happy and tried predicting a reversal. i'm embarassed about this one. the $ip pds seemed like a correct read on the market so i don't fully understand why this one failed but i exited early and it seems like there was no chance of profit or breakeven after i exited. i'll be analyzing this one closely. for now i need to address my primary instincts of closing early. albeit these unstable market conditions are making it difficult.",3,,[deleted],0

[the best time to invest in oil was anytime between the 2014 and the ukraine war. the best time to sell? who knows. all i know is that the government is interested in pushing gas prices lower. only way to do that is introduce more supply so reserves will be the first to go but it won't make that much of a dent. what really needs to happen is oil production needs to increase and that is up to the exploration companies (exxon, shell, bp, etc). in this environment (where the price per barrel is high), they would be hard pressed not to ramp up production, but ramping up takes time and requires resources. there have been some hard lessons learned over the years so exploration companies will be a lot more cautious in this environment to strike a balance in an attempt to not overdo it and end up with more supply than demand thus leading to more layoffs and downsizing. do i see price per barrel increasing to $150-200 a barrel? mmmm, it's a possibility depending on what opec decides to do. if i were them i'd try to stabilize the prices around 150-200 by maintaining the supply just below the demand but the rest of the world surely aren't going to like that. i know that most exploration companies have been hemorrhaging since 2014. they spent a lot of time downsizing and squeezing their suppliers for every single penny in order to make startup costs cheaper and drive down breakeven prices. this was all in preparation for living in a low ""cost-per-barrel"" environment for many many years to come. now that prices are up they will certainly take advantage of it by pushing more supply to the market thus decreasing the overall price. they don't need 150-200 a barrel to make it out like a bandit.](/r/stocks/comments/t83yl2/buy_oil_and_gas_stocks_now/hzm15ej/)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; houston/washington, march 8 (reuters) - u.s. officials have demanded venezuela supply at least a portion of oil exports to the united states as part of any agreement to ease oil trading sanctions on the opec member nation, two people close to the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. president joe biden on tuesday banned u.s. imports of russian oil in retaliation for the invasion of ukraine, ramping up economic pressure on a key venezuelan ally.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. diplomats have worked to find energy supplies worldwide that can help compensate for disruption to russian oil and gas exports caused by sanctions or war. u.s. officials met venezuelan president nicolas maduro in caracas for the first bilateral talks in years on saturday.
&gt; 
&gt; ##### register now for free unlimited access to reuters.com
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela has been under u.s. oil sanctions since 2019 and could reroute crude if those restrictions were lifted.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. officials made clear their priority was to secure supplies for the united states, the people told reuters. the officials told their venezuelan counterparts that any relaxation in u.s. sanctions would be conditional on venezuela shipping oil directly to the united states, the sources said.
&gt; 
&gt; the united states had not previously made stipulations about the specific destination of cargoes permitted under waivers to sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; the u.s. department of state and venezuelan state run energy company pdvsa did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; chevron corp [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n), the last u.s. oil producer still operating in venezuela, could be the first beneficiary if a deal is reached with maduro's administration. chevron has been barred from shipping venezuelan oil from its joint ventures since 2020 and has pushed to overturn the ban.
&gt; 
&gt; a chevron spokesperson declined to comment on the u.s. discussions. the company operates ""in compliance with the current sanctions framework provided by the u.s. office of foreign assets control,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; the california-based company has a special license that allows it to maintain a low-level presence in the country, only to ensure the maintenance and safety of its facilities.
&gt; 
&gt; with that license due to expire in june, chevron has sought authorization from the u.s. treasury department to trade venezuelan oil cargoes for debt repayment through a revamped exemption, reuters has reported. chevron wants the revised permit so it can recoup hundreds of million dollars in unpaid debt and late dividends from its joint ventures with pdvsa.
&gt; 
&gt; if washington decides to ease sanctions, chevron could be in position to partially recover production in venezuela and resume exports to its own and other refineries on the u.s. gulf coast, one of the sources said, replacing russian barrels.
&gt; 
&gt; chevron had no immediate comment.
&gt; 
&gt; little progress was made in the weekend talks as washington sought to gauge prospects for peeling maduro away from his alliance with russian president vladimir putin. but the parties agreed to further talks.
&gt; 
&gt; the sides established what one person familiar with the matter called ""maximalist"" negotiating positions. washington pressed for free presidential elections and for the release of americans jailed in venezuela, while maduro asked for a wide lifting of sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; but the most pressing topic was energy. the parties discussed returning venezuelan oil to markets hit by disruptions of russian supplies and a workaround for pdvsa to temporarily access international bank transfers, according to the sources.
&gt; 
&gt; the meeting sparked strong reactions on capitol hill, where new jersey senator robert menendez and other u.s. lawmakers criticized the outreach to maduro, who is under u.s. sanctions for human rights abuses.
&gt; 
&gt; the u.s. engagement comes as venezuela's financial lifeline to russia is fraying under sanctions on moscow following its bombardment of ukraine. venezuela's funds held in russian banks blacklisted by washington have been frozen.
&gt; 
&gt; oil prices rose another 5% on tuesday to $128 per barrel on the u.s. import ban on russia - which accounted for 670,000 barrels per day in 2021. britain said it will phase out russian imports by year end.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela's oil production last year recovered from free fall and averaged 636,000 bpd. officials have said it can boost output and exports, but analysts believe there is little room for further increases without massive new spending.
&gt; 
&gt; however, many refiners in the u.s. gulf coast that were importing russian barrels could potentially resume processing venezuelan heavy oil and fuel, among their preferred feedstock for specialized units.
&gt; 
&gt; before sanctions, u.s. valero energy [(vlo.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/vlo.n), citgo petroleum, chevron and pbf energy [(pbf.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/pbf.n) were among top u.s. buyers of venezuelan oil.

[it was nice being energy dependent. usa gas prices wouldn't have been effected as much from this conflict. banning russia oil won't effect us that much more. europe will get hit harder.  i just hope we don't start getting oil from terrorists. that was kind of the point of banning russia oil.  i've heard a lot of people say the president doesn't control gas prices recently. that just isn't true. biden has done a lot to control the gas prices.  we needed to ban russia oil, we cannot support them finically by buying oil from them. that must stand up to other countries that the usa cannot fund terrorism by buying oil from them. it needs to stop. we should have remained oil dependent.   i know this will get downvoted.](/r/stocks/comments/t9ig7n/biden_to_ban_imports_of_russian_oil_over_ukraine/hzugamg/)

[&gt;if you have followed the stock market for more than 2yrs, you will understand.  but why though ? stock market isn't usually run on qe times and its still going up fine, even more so qe was for economy not peoples apple stocks.  remember last time inflation was so high ? 1982 crash didn't come from inflation, it came from fed reaction to it when they raised the rates to 20%, what we are scared of ? 0.5% ?  after the crash what ensued was absolutely insane bull run that ended with dot com bubble, anual almost 60% for those who timed the bottom.  energy crisis is no good, but usa is not as affected as people might think, then everyone usually screams ''but muh europe'' which i find weird because in stock sub reddits before war europe was referenced as inconsequential europoors.  not promising sunshine or anything, i just don't see the supposed death to market as much.](/r/stocks/comments/ta4y9t/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_mar_09_2022/i01qwvd/)

here's some facts. congress men and women actively bought war, oil, and energy stocks the day before the invasion. while they aren't in charge of gas prices, plenty of low level republicans are profiting off forcing our country to rely on gas. forget putting money towards renewable energy, just keep making new pipelines.

1646959450,"i've put up a cross post on some other subs, i'll add it here as a comment just in case you're interested in the bigger picture:

hi there,

##**tldr**; inherited $450k of chevron stock which is currently experiencing extreme volatility and wondering if it's a good idea to take the jump into a long term active management relationship or if i should just bogle my money into a passive 3 fund etf portfolio that i manage myself for little to no cost, but any overall input on my situation is welcome as this is a big step for me.

i'm a 37 year old theater actor (theater industry still reeling from covid). i earn about 30k a year between my side hustle, which is wine tours (i live in napa, ca), and theater jobs, and 16k/yr from dividends from the inherited account.

i'm currently looking at moving to the la area to begin expanding into film work and better access to regional theater auditions, which would be a massive increase in expenses for me. my dividend income has really allowed me to stay afloat while i build my skills and resume in theater. my short-to-medium term picture is very unclear because i'm also tossing around the idea of relocating overseas, extended travel, going back to school for a different career, etc.

the big problem is, my account is 100% cvx shares (currently at all time highs and incredibly volatile due to recent events). my current broker does not actively manage my account since it's just 1 single holding and i declined their offer in years past to manage the account and help diversify for 1%aum. they are a medium sized firm and i would likely be one of their smallest clients, though we have family history.

they gave me a pitch to manage my assets and assist me in divesting from cvx:


*   i.      total stock market index (equity) ‚Äì 18%

*   ii.      esg fund (equity) ‚Äì 10%
 
*   iii.      international fund (equity) ‚Äì 10%
 
*   iv.      dividend fund (equity) ‚Äì 5%
 
*   v.      value fund (equity) ‚Äì 5%
 
*    vi.      low duration bond fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 20%

*    vii.      income fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 20%

*   viii.      short term bond fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 10%

*    ix.      cash ‚Äì 2%

this based on the discussion that i may need income to support my relocation and i might be looking at trying to finance a house/condo in the next 3-5 years. my short term plans are very much up in the air due to pandemic, relocation, possibly returning to school to look at a career change, etc. i don't have a job offer in la, nor do i have eyes on a place yet, but i have a lot of entertainment industry contacts and a background in the wine industry which i feel confident will help me at least find decent work quickly enough. i have about 60k saved in cash to give me a bit of a runway and i have another 10k available as margin (at 2% rate currently). no debt and very low expenses (for now).

i have a friend who is also a cfp who looked at their ideas for me and basically agreed that they aren't doing anything revolutionary or untoward and would likely serve me just fine, and he also offered to manage my money himself (he is with a much smaller firm and i would be one of his biggest clients, and might be able to devote a lot more time to my account). my friends ethics also align much more closely to mine which is important to me.

i currently have a roth ira and a taxable brokerage acct with m1 finance worth about 75k, about 50k of that is in equities and about 25k in cash earning 1% interest. i have another 30k in a savings account in cash. i'm looking at about a -$45k tax bill based on my cost basis for the shares if i liquidate that account and about $4k/yr for management with either option. my friend is also available on an hourly rate fee basis, but he feels it would be best to bring my account into his book given the complexity of my goals and current situation rather than just directing me to do it myself for $2k a year in consultation fees. of course, there's some bias to that recommendation, but it may still be good advice.

overall, i feel confident that both of these advisors are very trustworthy. both are about my same age, and both are interested in ethical financial practices like i am (my friend has a much more ethics-based component to his practices but will always defer to client preferences). i'm just not sure if i should save that extra $4k/yr and just draw out money as i need supplementary income myself, or if it would be a good idea in my position to have a go-to cfp to help direct my finances for me.

i am fairly confident in my ability to navigate a bogle-style 3 fund portfolio and i have a few speculative assets in my personal brokerage account, but i am not a financial professional. my own account is mostly index etfs with some speculative plays and individual picks and i've done fairly well for myself over the last 4 years in my own little sandbox.

1646996863,"it seems to me that you have enough knowledge to set up a diversified portfolio without paying a hefty 1% sum for aum. you found and sought advice from the boglehead forum so you must have predicted what type of advice you would get here.

my suggestions:
1. sell the cvx stock or at least enough of it to get it down to below 5% of your portfolio. where is the $45k tax bill coming from? it seems unrealistically high. inherited stock, when held in a taxable account, gets a step up in basis upon the death of the deceased and any gain would be considered long term, so a capital gains rate of 15% is the most likely rate. you would have to have a gain of $300k to force a ltcg tax of $45k

2. based upon you current circumstances, with several life changes being considered, i‚Äôd be cautious about scaling your stock picking based upon your wealth. adopt a three fund portfolio after setting aside any money you may need for your short term needs (3-5 years or less). if your plans change, you can deploy any excess cash later.",2,,BoglesFollies,0

1647074572,"so, ray dalio has done a lot of work testing his all weather portfolio over time:  
  
30% us stocks, 40% long-term treasuries, 15% intermediate-term treasuries, 7.5% commodities, diversified and 7.5% gold.  
  
this could be broadly covered by etfs 30% $vti, 40% $vglt, 15% $vgit, 7.5% $iau and 7.5% $pdbc.  
  
however, i'd guess that inflation will rise and growth will fall over the next five years... that creates a couple of problems, because stocks are going to be less  interesting and those vglt and vgit products should dip in value because of rising interest rates gradually making the bonds they hold irrelevant. so, perhaps foolishly i'd ignore these bond products and go for stocks in sectors that have a high level of outperformance vs. inflation and a high probability of beating inflation. that is basically energy, equity reits, consumer staples and perhaps utilities and healthcare at a push.  
  
warren buffett is better at picking stocks than me (though i appreciate he has some challenges because he is working with giant amounts of money unlike me!), but on a dcf basis his picks of $khc (consumer staples), $cvx (energy) and $stor (equity reit) look viable. i would add those to the 7.5% $iau and 7.5% $pdbc etfs.

the split between khc, cvx and stor is more difficult but i'd probably have the larger part in khc because it looks better value (and buffett has a bigger position in that).",1,,4dham,0
1647088015,"first off, this is a very good problem to have!

i‚Äôm studying to be a cfp right now, and i‚Äôm highly critical of the aum model. advisors tend to overcomplicate things, because if they just make what i see as a prudent choice and drop most of their clients‚Äô money into, say, a target-date retirement fund, you would quickly realize their 1% fee is patently absurd‚Äìyou could manage this shit yourself and almost certainly get better returns through passive index funds!

i‚Äôm not sure what the most prudent decision is regarding selling your chevron stock‚Äîmy instinct would be to sell it all, since if you‚Äôre filing single, your taxable income is presumably below the ~$445,000 cap, past which the ltcg rate becomes 20%. if you were to try for the 0% rate, you‚Äôd only be selling a fraction of the stock in any given year, and it would take more than a decade to dispose of it. (all the while, chevron‚Äôs value could plummet‚Äîyou never know!)

there might be some weird tax implications if your income suddenly skyrockets for a year (welfare cliffs and the like if you‚Äôre on government-sponsored anything), so if that sort of thing keeps you up at night, you might consider hiring your friend (at the hourly rate only) to clarify the tax situation in regards to selling your stock. (then again, you could probably do this research yourself, as i doubt the answer‚Äôs very complicated.)

i know myself well enough to say that i would be kicking myself if i held all my assets in one company and something bad happened to it. by being strongly invested in one company, you expose yourself to tremendous amounts of non-systematic risk since you‚Äôre only one oil spill or corporate scandal away from losing vast amounts of unrealized wealth. if your time horizon is plenty long, you can take your profits now and invest it all in something simple and cheap, whether that be a target-date retirement fund, or a total stock market index fund, or a total international stock market index fund, or a total bond market index fund‚Ä¶ sky‚Äôs the limit! just keep it simple (no more than three funds) and keep the fees cheap! the alternative is to let your advisor siphon off nearly $5000 a year from you just to create a complicated portfolio with 8 separate funds that closely mimics a conservative target-date retirement fund, one you could get yourself for less than 0.10% per year (only $450!)

i might not have all of the intricacies down yet (i‚Äôve only completed one semester), but one of the ironies in the industry is that it‚Äôs not vast amounts of knowledge that generate wealth‚Äîit‚Äôs practicing a few simple behaviors. keep your fees low when you can, keep your investments simple enough that *you* can understand and manage them, and if you still have questions and feel like hiring an advisor, stick with an hourly rate‚Äîcome to them with a specific problem and pay them $500 to deal with it. don‚Äôt sign up for an aum plan that costs 10 times as much year after year and only further complicates your life.",1,,have_two_cows,0

1647174093,"[talk to tdameritrade about transferring ownership.  but the tax implications may not be what you imagine.  there are tax rules about transactions between family members that attempt to seek to describe a taxable event in an advantageous way.  tdameritrade might simply recommend she sell, and you buy at market.  or she might request delivery of actual physical certificates of stock which no longer would be held by tdameritrade. then she could transfer ownership to you without tdameritrade involved by signing them over to you.  i suspect this is all going to waste much time, become unnecessarily expensive, and achieve less than you expect.  but  you might consider another alternative.  since a mere $150usd is involved, i suggest you just gift her the amount of her losses and ask her to hold the baba for you. that's informal and private. and settles the promise you made.    you are allowed to gift her a tax free gift of such a small sum.  if and when the stock is eventually sold, the profit or loss will be on her tax return. she might then quietly hand the proceeds over you after paying taxes on her 1040.  the irs isn't likely going to chase $150usd hidden transaction or even more if the capital gains taxes were paid.  this is all trivial.  if the sums are significant, get some legitimate tax help on your reporting.](/r/stocks/comments/tbyce3/possible_to_complete_off_market_transaction/i0a4hj1/)

[my bull case for coin. i doubled down at these levels:  coinbase (coin) is the most respected, usa based regulated cryptocurrency exchange trading at just 21 times earnings. it is the most secure crypto exchange and has a 56 million user base with 11% market share. 90% of their revenue comes from fees that they have held steady. coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. coinbase might make more money than nasdaq. why i like coin is that it is a play on bitcoin *and* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. for now, coin is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (nft marketplace; custody agent for facebook's crypto novi wallet and sofi's crypto offering and others; starting a media arm; crypto derivatives; coinbase cloud; etc). another advantage of coin is it being the first crypto exchange coming on to a major market exhange is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. and you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. in other words, crypto has a natural constituency. like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like bitcoin to me and i think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.   as far as the criticism of coinbase‚Äôs business model being eroded by other competitor entrants, coin isn‚Äôt the same as a traditional exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate. coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account. handling cryptocurrencies is much trickier than holding stocks, given that crypto has a history of being hacked or lost. the company is also building out a ‚Äúsuite of services‚Äù that have recurring revenue, including a program called ‚Äústaking‚Äù that allows crypto holders to earn interest.](/r/stocks/comments/te3f4q/is_coinbase_undervalued_now/i0qf3qe/)

[inflation just means prices go up due to increased money in the system. its doesnt mean less wage. the current inflation is caused predominantly by the labor shortage which has pushed wages way up. if wages werent going up, inflation would be very tame.  also even if we have bad inflation, its still not as bad as you say. how would i feel if my buying power went down? guess what ? its been plummeting since the 80s (see reagaonmics) and wages had not kept up until now. 2021 was one of the few times in nearly 40 years where we saw wages outpace prices.  also how bad was the stagflation era? are you actually claiming it was somehow worse than the pandemic? it wasnt. it was a bunch of cry babies peeing their pants like sissies thanks to news bias and huckster politicians (basically same as today but it was much easier back then since media was easily controlled). in reality, all that happened is what i said prior. they simply tightened their belts for a couple of years. once it was over, they had one of the biggest investment booms in history of the usa. check the charts. and mind you that was a very different situation. when stagflation happened, unemployment was high and wages were going no where. we have the opposite problem. unemployment is low, we cant fill jobs, and wages are skyrocketing. im not saying this is a good thing. it isnt, but thats our current reality and its not going away any time soon.](/r/stocks/comments/teiyy0/hang_seng_index_is_almost_at_2011_levels/i0x0780/)

[it is my belief that we are in a long term commodity super cycle.  now that can all end if the world goes into a recession.  however, nearly every government in the world has printed fiat money out of thin air at levels never seen before.  also, commodities tend to be the last stocks that boom at the end of bull markets.  that is what happened during 2002-2008.  if i look at oil futures, they are still over the 50 dma on the 3 month chart.  that tells me that panic fear of missing out the money from the russian/ukraine war has sold out.  we are going to have tighter demand if europe &amp; usa actually follow thru with boycotting natural gas and crude oil from russia.  plus there is the unlikely possibility that saundi's actually sell crude oil to china for yuan instead of us dollars.  i think that's unlikely,  but i also would have never thought the us would cut russia of from the swift banking clearinghouse either.    so, yeah i tend to agree with you. i have been buying oil stocks over oil futures or stocks that track the crude oil futures price.  i am fine holding to cheap companies that pay nice dividends.  i haven't bought any oil stocks since oil got over $90, but i will prolly be adding in the next few days.](/r/stocks/comments/tfkva1/i_believe_there_is_plenty_of_money_to_be_made_in/i0wgxmr/)

[all i infer: with sanctions on russia in place, opec will try to boost their revenue/profits, keeping pressure on oil, esp consumers like usa &amp; euro, japan, while india, china will deal with russia in local currencies.   us is forced to explore oil, gas, alternate energy like wind, thermal and nuclear. this is going for a long term say 2 to 6 years from now, along with possible recession in 2-3 years.  exploration leads xop, xle, oih and ura is bullish mode.  btw: i own all of these etfs now, dca every time it dips including today.](/r/stocks/comments/tfkva1/i_believe_there_is_plenty_of_money_to_be_made_in/i0wgdm6/)

march 18 (reuters) - oilfield services company halliburton co (hal.n) said on friday it has suspended future business in russia, including for certain state-owned russian customers, in compliance with u.s. sanctions after moscow's invasion of ukraine.  
  
the company said it has no active joint ventures in the country and had weeks ago halted all shipments of specific sanctioned parts and products to russia.  
  
other western energy companies such as bp plc , shell and norway's equinor asa (eqnr.ol) have either suspended business or announced plans to abandon their russia operations, leaving behind their investments.  
  
russia, which calls its actions in ukraine a ""special operation"", is among the world's largest oil and gas producers that mainly relies on home-grown service providers.  
  
earlier this month, oil major exxon mobil (xom.n) said it would exit russia oil and gas operations valued at more than $4 billion and halt new investment.",5,,PURPLESKOLDIER,0
1647658145,"so those leaps would only be considered hedges if you were long oil and natural gas or chinese stocks. do you own a ton of $baba, $tme, etc or $cvx, $xom, etc ?

if not, you're more just playing market trends. 

but to make a more important point for letfs as hedges... 

the purpose of a hedge is to protect against drawdown in your portfolio. if you have a leap two years out on an letf, it wont act as an efficient hedge, within only a few months.

letfs are calculated on daily percentage changes in the underlying, so lets say you had your whole portfolio in $ndx or $qqq. you buy leap puts on $tqqq or leap calls on $sqqq.

if your portfolio is actually doing well, 3, 6, 9 months after the fact, your hedges, depending on daily movement, have become very ineffective from a cost basis standpoint.

letfs are for day and swing trading primarily. you'd be better off renewing or rolling shorter term hedges, while being mindful of theta decay.",4,,One-Evening4725,0

i think with $100 oil we can see anywhere from $120 to $200 in terms of the price of the stock. the real question becomes what the market values the dividend and buyback as. normally dividends should get a 2 multiple (due to certainty) and buybacks a 1.5 multiple, so if you can do a 4% dividend and a 4% buyback for 4-5 years the stock deserves a 14 multiple at least just from that. given that $100 oil and $10 average gas would generate north of $15 a share, well that's how you get to $200+.‚Äù",1,,FemaleEcho,0

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; washington, march 22 (reuters) - sidelined in high-level talks between the united states and venezuela, the south american country's opposition is pressing washington to condition any easing of oil sanctions on political concessions, three people involved in the matter said, adding new hurdles to oil companies hoping to resume operations there.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. diplomats have sought to find energy supplies worldwide that can help replace russian oil and gas as buyers steer clear of russia's imports over its invasion of ukraine. u.s. officials met venezuelan president nicolas maduro in caracas for the first bilateral talks in years earlier this month.
&gt; 
&gt; the venezuelan opposition request adds to the issues temporarily thwarting efforts by oil firms to win u.s. approvals to get access to the country's crude for unpaid debts. if accepted, the opposition's proposal will pause any consideration of u.s. imports of venezuelan oil.
&gt; 
&gt; ##### register now for free unlimited access to reuters.com
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; furor created by the diplomats' visit to caracas has effectively chilled hopes for chevron corp [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n), eni spa [(eni.mi)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/eni.mi) and repsol [(rep.mc)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/rep.mc) to win u.s. approvals that would help them trade venezuelan oil cargoes for billions of dollars in past debts.
&gt; 
&gt; the opposition's stance, laid out in recent meetings between u.s. state department officials and opposition leader juan guaido's envoys, undercuts a faction within president joe biden's administration seeking a new policy toward the country with the world's largest crude reserves.
&gt; 
&gt; washington recognizes guaido as venezuela's rightful leader and had shunned maduro after calling his 2018 reelection a sham. u.s. oil sanctions imposed in 2019 were aimed at ousting maduro. the u.s. officials' visit to venezuela caught the opposition by surprise and sparked a backlash from u.s. republicans and some of biden's fellow democrats in congress.
&gt; 
&gt; democratic senator bob menendez urged biden to ""not breathe new life"" into what he called maduro's ""reign of torture and murder"" by relaxing oil sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; high cost
&gt; 
&gt; weighing into the fray, guaido warned oil companies lobbying for access to venezuelan oil to stick with democracy and not aid maduro's government. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-opposition-asks-oil-companies-stick-democracy-2022-03-17/)
&gt; 
&gt; ""biden's administration has realized playing with venezuelan barrels comes at high cost,"" one of the people familiar with the washington discussions said.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. officials have so far assured the opposition that no decision has been made on sanctions relief, according to two people familiar with the matter. washington also wants to see concrete steps by maduro for restarting discussions with the opposition in mexico and organizing free elections, the three people familiar with the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; a prompt authorization of u.s. imports of venezuelan oil could happen if global crude prices again hit levels reached earlier this month, pushing up u.s. gasoline prices that the biden administration is closely monitoring, one of the people said.
&gt; 
&gt; the u.s. state department did not immediately comment on the discussions.
&gt; 
&gt; a wrapup
&gt; 
&gt; high-level talks between maduro and u.s. officials were conceived to prod him to resume a political dialogue with the opposition that has been suspended since october, and to free americans jailed, according to people familiar with the visit preparation.
&gt; 
&gt; ""nobody in washington has taken responsibility for the idea of wrapping the oil licenses discussion with the political demands,"" another source said after one of the meetings with state department officials.
&gt; 
&gt; among the opposition's arguments against easing sanctions are the limited effect oil from venezuela - whose output has been cut to a third in five years by under-investment, mismanagement and sanctions - would have among u.s. refiners, versus the aid it would provide maduro as he continues dragging his feet toward new elections.
&gt; 
&gt; some u.s. officials share that view, while others are trying to secure any possible source of oil to replace russia's barrels even at a high cost.
&gt; 
&gt; ""what's the value of the commodity of freedom?"" said a member of guaido's team.
&gt; 
&gt; chevron's current license, which is set to expire in june, has allowed the firm only to keep and maintain its assets. the u.s. treasury had started drafting a revamped license to the firm and authorizations to others, people familiar with the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; but final policy guidance from the u.s. state department has not been received, two of the people said, as political winds shifted against any proposal to ease the u.s. sanctions.

* co2 stays in the atmosphere for 300-1000 years -[nasa](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2915/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/)

* this means co2 released into the atmosphere during the industrial revolution- is still present and still causing climate impacts. 

* [last year humans added 40.8 *billion tons* of co2 to the atmosphere](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2021-2). your car likely weighs ~2 tons. together we all made 40,800,000,000 *tons* of co2- just last year.



even if humans stopped adding co2 *today*, what we've done already gives the earth a heavy blanket. unless this shit gets pulled out of the atmo, its going to fuel even more catastrophic climate change. 

carbon capture isnt something we're we're very good at, and it isnt something humans can easily extract profit from, but it is necessary. yanno the way governments subsidize the oil and gas industries that *made* all this co2? we're gonna need similar subsidies to pull it back out of the atmosphere. 

if you believe that humans are going to meet the challenge of climate change, oxy.n is a good long term hold. if you believe humans are on the cusp of some mad max shit, oxy.n is a reasonable way to hedge in case you're wrong. and hey, if the future is more bartertown and pirate motorcycle gangs than start trek and teslas, the money you put on oxy.n wont mean anything anyway.

1648072991,"most of what i read expresses concern about the growing risk of a policy mis-step.  i've read some opinions suggesting the fed should have started moving rates upward in 2020 and 2021.  uh...and just how in a global pandemic with the sorts of extreme policy decision making going on at every governmental level in this nation and many others, does chairman powell suggest raising rates?  how soon we forget and how easy to say out loud now...

against the current backdrop, i've (mentally) prepared for several of my companies who were pretty optimistic about global capex spend, particularly in the eu and russia, to be singing a new song in q1.  

i think the eu has and will put major capex investment (smart buildings, other cleaner/greener infrastructure, added mfg capacity) on pause.   i expect $jci, $emr, and $slb to benefit from capex flowing into oil/gas and/or projects funded by oil/gas in other parts of the world with europe and obviously, russia, now on hold.  bp is selling its north sea field, i think they'll find a buyer, which has potential to benefit $hlx among others.  

a wild card is mexican oil policy.  earlier this year/late last year, their president signaled less exports and more internal use of their oil/gas.  the current pricing environment may influence a different direction with mexican gom off shore fields ramping.  in this game, make it will you can.  

$cvx will be fine.  expect my midstreams to report full pipes, filling storage, and exporting available barrels over their docks, impacted by the winter maintenance cycle and winter weather, but benefiting from oil/gas prices.

1648256003,"my process has been changing a little recently... with a company like $fb or $googl, my analysis is more focused on current valuation in respect to their moat -- in both cases, i'm confident that they will be doing just fine over the next 5, even 10 years, without calculating their cash flows. the fact that they are so profitable, have such strong moats, and are simply so *huge...* and can buy back shares on dips... is enough for me.

for a hedge like $xom, i simply tell myself: this company never dilutes, serves as an oil inflation hedge (something i'm very worried about, as my career capital is entirely in tech), and even if i'm wrong for 20 years, they will still pay a fantastic-to-me dividend yield of 5%

edit: where i do 3-5 year projections, is with growth stocks -- it is risky but i think it is basically is the best way to value a high-conviction growth stock. but, you have to do some in-depth qualitative analysis to have faith that your growth projections are in the ballpark for a secular story. examples from my portfolio would include $meli (which i need to review my valuation work), $upst, $roku.",2,,liquidamber_h,0

1648282100,"60/40 portfolio split no longer works. ( articles on google give more context)
i view it as funds like (buffet) ape‚Äôing into securities that have pricing power (rushing to rebalance fund in new env), so multiples not compressed as inflation rises. or, it could be that the stock market in inflationary environment is best place to park money (definitely not bonds). 

&gt;	steve chiavarone, portfolio manaaa ger at federated hermes, which manages $634 billion. ‚Äúright now the best thing to do in 60/40 is to overweight equities. equities are a better inflation hedge.‚Äù

or funds moving to commodities or alternative assets other than ‚Äústocks and bonds‚Äù. 

the bond mkt has been a very nice long for a long time, but recently you‚Äôve had 4 std deviation events to the downside. this money will go somewhere so i‚Äôm in the camp that entire sectors reprice quickly. i think it‚Äôs happening rn.

oil and gas, which is a small portion of s&amp;p has outperformed this year, and continues to outperform hard as funds rotate in; not that many companies to move into btw so seeing big moves . pricing power isn‚Äôt just oil/gas if you look at $vegi it‚Äôs moving quickly as well. individual companies with pricing power again outperforming and quickly, like $mos $ande $oxy $cvx moving 50%+ in 2wk spans. or commodities, which to some are the main instruments to monitor the russia crisis halting up and forcing companies like trafigura to beg for loans, and companies on the short side like tsinghan getting murdered. so being caught on the wrong side also causes this repricing.",7,,repos39,0

1648356898,"disagree.

&amp;#x200b;

number of shares change would show if buffet is increasing or decreasing his position, value of position is more impacted by the market's overall preference at the time.

&amp;#x200b;

for instance buffet recently reduced his chevron position 50% before the run up in oil.  however, oil/chevron stock also has nearly doubled over the same time period so via this value based chart chevron would not change.

&amp;#x200b;

even though buffet both missed the oil run up and decreased his position this chart is not indicative.  multiply this error by every stock in his portfolio and this chart is really quite useless.

&amp;#x200b;

with all that being said i would still work as a janitor at brk to parrot his genius trades.

$cvx looks topped out here. i'm guessing a lot of ""buy the rumor"" investors already moved on it. $fang depends on your opinion of how long this run will go. however, it doesn't look quite as topped out as $cvx. i probably wouldn't touch either at these prices, especially with the iran agreement looming.",3,,mrpoopistan,0
