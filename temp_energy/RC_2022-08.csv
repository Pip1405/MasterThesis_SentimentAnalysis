1659526583,"tldr: there is accounting stupid things that make it look weird, in part. however, i cannot find data on how much they do award in # shares for compensation.

for what it‚Äôs worth, i asked investor relations last qtr about shares to get my dilution metrics right. here‚Äôs a few snippets:

‚Äúthe main reason for the diluted share count increase is that accounting rules require us to use a formulaic accounting method to calculate the warrants that are considered ‚Äúin the money‚Äù and add them to the basic share count.  as the share price increases, more of the ~115 mm outstanding warrants are included in the diluted share count.  the average share price for 1q22 was ~$44 which translated to ~58 mm shares being added to the diluted share count.  here‚Äôs the math of how it was calculated in 1q (($44-$22)/$44*115,142,723) = 57.9 mm.  so as long as warrants remain outstanding and ‚Äúin the money‚Äù we will have to apply this methodology for calculating the diluted share count.‚Äù

in essence, as the share price increases, the stupid formula counts more (but not all) of the oxt-wt $22 strike warrants. 

same formula would apply to berkshire warrants. here‚Äôs a hypothetical of how it‚Äôs have worked at q1 end if share price had averaged $100 in that quarter:

‚Äúoxy stock price: $100

common warrants: (($100-$22)/$100*115.1mm) = 89.8 mm

berkshire warrants: (($100-$59.62)/$100*83.9mm) = 33.9 mm

basic shares outstanding: 936.7 mm

diluted shares outstanding: 1,060.4 mm‚Äù


summary: there are accounting rules dictating how diluted is measured. do your own math. here‚Äôs my minimum dilution metric: ~930m outstanding + ~84m brk warrants + ~111.5m $22 strike warrants = ~1,125.5

missing pieces: what options are granted but not yet exercised from the past, and what the annual share-based comp is.

1659825002,this highlights perfectly how you don't know about markets and bid and ask and mark and arbitrage.  the list goes on.   go take some statistics classes and data science related topics while you're at it to understand how lowering a high asking price that was no where near the mark price is a relevant point.  the stock market does this every day and we don't talk about how a seller lowered his ask price on xom stock.  it's irrelevant to the market.,2,,cj-the-pj,0

a safer lower volatility etf ($schd, $sphd, $vym, etc.) pays ~ 3%-4%.  you would need $743,000.

1659972195,"ok so let's say you got eth...

you can lend your eth on aave on the optimism layer 2. there you get 1% apy + 2.5% apy in $op tokens. then you borrow let's say usdt, effectively going long on eth (using leverage). current borrow interest rate is 3.4%, but you also get rewards in $op tokens at 1.6% rate. good job, now you are earning 1.6% a year for borrowing something, but be careful, you are leveraged...

now with that usdt you borrowed, you can naviguate through defi apps, like [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance). these apps have vaults for particular tokens and yield farming techniques already implemented for them, everything is clear as water , just verify. currently the usdt has a brand new vault and apy isn't known, (expect an additionnal 2%). maybe you can also go on [curve.finance](https://curve.finance) and provide liquidity there at 1% apy + stake that pool token you will earn for about 7% apy in additional $curve rewards. or stake that into [convexfinance.com](https://convexfinance.com) pools to get about 16% apy in $cvx/$curve rewards..

to yield farm you need to do a lot of research and understand how defi apps works. it can also cost a lot in fees if you only do this with small amounts of crypto.. usually you want to chase new protocols that have liquidity mining rewards activated, effectively inflation of a token to attract liquidity and users. optimism is currently having many liquidity mining programs.. thats why yields are boosted on lets say aave. in the past bancor was giving up to 35% apy on usdt in $bnt tokens. it was pretty neat.. just gotta look around, find yields, borrow for less , and provide for more... it's easier in bull markets though. and you dont have to use leverage, this is just a bit more risky and fun imo",2,,99Thebigdady,0

1661179944,"as the pandemic set in, investors including warren buffett ditched shares of occidental petroleum corp. now, the oil-and-gas producer is the best-performing stock in the s&amp;p 500 this year, and a newfound favorite of the veteran investor.

more than two years after selling off its common shares of occidental, mr. buffett‚Äôs berkshire hathaway inc. is the company‚Äôs largest shareholder with about 20% of its stock, according to recent filings, and mr. buffett received regulatory approval friday to buy up to 50%.

buoyed by soaring commodity prices, occidental has substantially paid down its debt load and is generating cash. the company now looks like a strong fit for mr. buffett, say investors and analysts. it is strengthening its balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders; it holds the largest position in the most active u.s. oil field; and it is investing in technologies to reduce carbon emissions, which some of mr. buffett‚Äôs businesses are also doing.

‚Äúit checks off a lot of his boxes,‚Äù said steven check, chief investment officer of check capital management, which is invested in berkshire. ‚Äúit‚Äôs american, it has great cash flow and it‚Äôs a rational capital allocator.‚Äù

mr. buffett has publicly praised the strategy of occidental chief executive officer vicki hollub, and many analysts have speculated berkshire could buy the entire company. mr. buffett hasn‚Äôt informed occidental of any plans to acquire a controlling stake in the company and is unlikely to do so in the near-term, people familiar with the matter say.

‚Äúwhat vicki hollub was saying made nothing but sense,‚Äù mr. buffett said at berkshire‚Äôs recent annual shareholder meeting. ‚Äúand i decided that it was a good place to put berkshire‚Äôs money.‚Äù

under ms. hollub‚Äôs leadership, occidental has cut its debt load, repurchased shares and raised its dividends. like other companies, it has also been conservative about boosting production, despite oil prices rising.

that strategy is paying off. occidental generated a record $4.35 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter and $3.7 billion in profit. after its shares fell roughly 80% in 2020, occidental‚Äôs stock has jumped 146% this year, a rally driven, in part, by mr. buffett‚Äôs purchases.

the company still faces challenges. long-term doubts remain about demand for oil and gas as some countries shift to greener energy sources and some investors remain wary of the industry. occidental is also betting big on carbon capture, a technology whose profitability is unproven.

occidental entered the pandemic saddled with debt from a $38 billion deal to take over rival anadarko petroleum corp., part of which it funded with $10 billion from berkshire. plunging oil prices led the company to lay off employees and cut executives‚Äô salaries‚Äîincluding ms. hollub‚Äôs‚Äîand slash expenses in the oil patch.

but while the deal looked ill-timed, analysts say, the assets occidental acquired from anadarko have since helped solidify its position as the largest producer in the permian basin, the prolific shale oil field in west texas and new mexico. the company said it produced roughly half a million barrels of oil a day domestically in the second quarter of the year, compared with about 280,000 barrels before it acquired anadarko.

occidental has said it generates a profit when oil prices are as low as $40 a barrel. in the second quarter of the year, brent crude oil prices averaged $114.1 per barrel and u.s. crude prices averaged $109.9 per barrel, according to scotiabank.

all facts point to occidental being a play on domestic oil production for mr. buffett, said bill stone, chief investment officer of glenview trust, which held shares of both berkshire and occidental as of the end of the second quarter.

mr. buffett has also boosted his purchases of chevron corp. this year, making it berkshire‚Äôs fourth-largest holding.

occidental has said it aims to reach net-zero emissions on its operations and energy use by 2040. the company has invested in carbon removal through its oxy low carbon ventures and plans to develop the first industrial-scale plant to capture carbon dioxide from the air, which it says will require upward of $1 billion in investment.

the company‚Äôs focus on becoming a greener operator may inform mr. buffett‚Äôs appetite, analysts said. berkshire‚Äôs energy unit, berkshire hathaway energy, has stated a goal of retiring its coal units by 2049 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

occidental intends to develop 70 plants to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2035, it told investors in march. it has said it would invest between $100 million and $300 million through its low-carbon unit this year. investment bank truist securities said in a june note that more than 10% of occidental‚Äôs total business could come from its carbon capture division in a couple of years, up from less than 5% currently.

the $433 billion climate package president biden signed into law this month could accelerate the development of carbon-capture projects, industry experts say. the legislation raises the tax credit for direct air carbon capture and sequestration to $180 per metric ton from $50 previously.

the credits are helpful for carbon capture businesses, but some scientists say it is unrealistic to deploy the technology on a large scale because it needs huge amounts of energy, while some environmental groups say it could prolong fossil fuel consumption.

ms. hollub told investors earlier this month that the climate package was a good development for the company, pointing to the tax credits as one reason why ‚Äúthis is turning into for us a net very positive bill.‚Äù

mr. buffett has long been a buyer of oil and gas ventures, not always successfully. in 2008, he bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gas prices were near a peak, just before they fell.

‚Äúthe terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars,‚Äù mr. buffett wrote in the company‚Äôs 2008 annual report.

1661198357,"**business insider: warren buffett's occidental petroleum stake could sour like 2008 oil bet**

should investors follow warren buffett as his berkshire hathaway continues to build a stake in occidental petroleum? according to bank of america, the answer is ""no.""¬†

the bank reiterated its ""neutral"" view on occidental in a monday note to investors, setting an $80 price target, which represents potential upside of about 12% from current levels.¬†

""if [buffett's stake in] occidental petroleum is a bullish view [on oil prices] there are better options given its limited upside,"" bofa said.¬†

buffett already owns more than 20% of the company, has warrants to purchase even more of the stock, and was granted approval last week to purchase up to 50% of the company. while buffett hasn't expressed intent for a full takeover of the company by berkshire hathaway, that can change down the road.

but with limited upside in the stock, buffett risks bidding against himself for full control of the company, bofa said.

""berkshire hathaway's role as the 'rate of change' agent may have been overlooked but their disclosed interest may continue to squeeze short positions, recent outperformance may mean the risk from here is that berkshire hathaway ends up bidding against itself,"" bofa said.

the bank reminded investors that buffett's oil bets haven't always panned out well, including his purchase of conocophillips right before the 2008 stock market meltdown.¬†

""this would not be the first time berkshire hathaway has publicly made a call on oil prices: but its track record has not always worked out so well... we recall a time in the past when berkshire hathaway has very publicly taken a sizeable equity position as a tangible demonstration of a directional position on oil prices,"" bofa said.

in 2008, berkshire hathaway built a 5.5% stake in conocophillips before its stock price plummeted amid a crash in oil prices due to an economic slowdown.¬†

buffett conceded in his annual shareholder letter: ""...[l]ast year i made a major mistake... without urging from anyone else, i bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gras prices were near their peak. i in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred...i still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future... but so far i have been dead wrong,"" buffett said.

""our point is not to pick on berkshire hathaway's misfortunes around energy in 2008: it was certainly not alone. it is simply to point out that just because berkshire hathaway has chosen to step into occidental petroleum in 2022 does not necessarily imply some proprietary insight that can drive differential market recognition of value,"" bofa said.

ultimately, if an investor has the view that oil prices will continue to move higher, there are better oil stocks to invest in to express that view, according to bofa.

""while berkshire hathaway will no doubt continue to squeeze an elevated short position, we see better options to play that theme where there is still: rate of change, capacity for outsized cash returns with similar operating leverage and more meaningful value upside. otherwise at this point, we see the risk for berkshire that it is at risk of bidding against itself,"" bofa concluded.

&gt; 
&gt; houston, aug 22 (reuters) - a u.s. court upheld a tribunal's $8.75 billion award to u.s. oil producer conocophillips [(cop.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cop.n) over the expropriation of its venezuelan oil assets, granting a default judgment in the case on friday.
&gt; 
&gt; the decision gives the u.s. company new authority to collect on a 2019 award by a world bank tribunal. the award includes interest that adds at least $1 billion to the amount owed to conoco.
&gt; 
&gt; the world bank's international centre for settlement of investment disputes awarded conoco $8.75 billion over the 2007 expropriation of three of its oil projects in the country. conoco had sought up to $30 billion for the takeover.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela's government rejected the court's decision in a statement issued by the president's office on monday evening, saying the country would continue to take legal action to ""preserve its patrimony.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""this unfair decision has been forged by violating... venezuela's right to defense,"" the statement said.
&gt; 
&gt; it added that the decision was in ""complicity with venezuelan extremists, including (opposition leader) juan guaido.""
&gt; 
&gt; guaido didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela seized conoco assets during late president hugo chavez's nationalizations of oil, electricity and steel industries.
&gt; 
&gt; the country was bound by the terms of the icsid convention and conoco had properly notified the country of its lawsuit through the u.s. department of state, u.s. district court judge carl nichols said in his decision.
&gt; 
&gt; conocophillips said it plans ""to pursue all available legal avenues to obtain a full and fair recovery,"" but did not comment on planned actions.
&gt; 
&gt; conoco previously has used legal seizures of venezuelan oil assets to enforce its claims. its share price rose less than 1% to $105.24 on a day in which the broader market fell sharply.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela's main foreign asset is u.s.-based citgo petroleum, an oil refiner that split from its parent in 2019 and has been operating under legal protections from creditors issued by the u.s. treasury department.

*with approval to buy 50% of occidental petroleum, the question for investors is what does berkshire hathaway see that the market does not?
occidental is expected to experience extreme downside earnings volatility into mid-decade compared to its peer group.*

*the market may be underestimating occidental‚Äôs growth potential outside of oil and gas production.
the chemicals business looks attractive from an economic cycle perspective, while carbon capture offers secular growth opportunities and synergies with oil and gas.
with the support of berkshire, and a technical mosaic that's bullish on all time frames, the risk/reward skews decidedly positive.*

1661856379,"&gt;oil production in the iraqi region of kurdistan could almost halve by 2027 if there is no new exploration or major investment in the sector, government documents seen by reuters showed.  
&gt;  
&gt;a steep decline in oil revenue, a lifeline for the kurdish regional government (krg), would compound the economic woes of a region already struggling financially within an unstable iraq, diplomats, officials, and energy experts said.  
&gt;  
&gt;according to the documents, the kurdistan region in iraq's (kri) oil output could rise to 580,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five year's time under a scenario in which investment is fully optimised, leaving 530,000 bpd available for export.  
&gt;  
&gt;but without new investment, the semi-autonomous region might only have 240,000 bpd available to export as older wells become depleted, the documents, which have not previously been reported, show.  
&gt;  
&gt;""it is very dangerous,"" said kri parliamentarian karwan gaznay, who is a member of the region's oil and gas committee.  
&gt;  
&gt;""we should be alarmed by it, but it will not be a real issue if we sort out our problems with the iraqi government, then kurdistan can develop new blocks and increase production. we have a lot of reservoirs,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;the krg did not respond to a request for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;under the iraqi constitution, the region is entitled to a portion of the national budget. but the arrangement collapsed in 2014 when the kurds seized control of iraq's main northern oilfields in kirkuk from islamic state and began selling crude from there independently.  
&gt;  
&gt;in 2018, iraqi forces retook disputed territories, including the oil city of kirkuk, and baghdad resumed some budget payments but they have been sporadic. so far this year, it has sent two payments of 200 billion iraqi dinars ($137 million). natural decline  
&gt;  
&gt;krg's debt currently stands at about $38 billion, according to a government official, and lawmaker gaznay said oil exports accounted for 85% of the region's budget.  
&gt;  
&gt;the krg's financial position has improved this year thanks to surging oil prices following russia's invasion of ukraine but a steep decline in output would significantly increase its fiscal constraints.  
&gt;  
&gt;the region's oil output has already slipped from about 468,000 bpd in 2019 to 445,000 last year and 434,000 in the first quarter of 2022, according to reports by deloitte.  
&gt;  
&gt;""the reason that the current oil production is going down is due to the inability of the ministry of natural resources to bring timely additional investment online to overcome the natural decline of 15% to 20% each year in production for each well,"" a source in the krg said.  
&gt;  
&gt;the government documents said falls in output at three major oilfields - tawke, khurmala and taq taq - are the main reason for decline.  
&gt;  
&gt;the potential slide in the kurdish region's oil output makes it important for the government to boost gas production, but a project to expand one of the biggest fields in iraq has been suspended due to security concerns. read more  
&gt;  
&gt;the oil in the region comes from drilling into fractures in limestone rocks. this initially results in high yields, but aggressive levels of production can rapidly drain the fractures and lead to water flooding in, energy experts said.  
&gt;  
&gt;rising water levels in several fields, including taq taq, have made it harder to access the oil, according to a government official and energy experts, who put the rapid depletion of the wells down to bad management and the challenging geology.  
&gt;  
&gt;energy experts and industry sources say attracting more investment could save the region from sliding into insolvency, but the difficult investment climate is getting in the way.  
&gt;  
&gt;""there is some field expansions, which are slow. companies are finding it hard to get approvals and there haven't been significant new discoveries for several years now,"" said robin mills, chief executive of consultancy qamar energy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""without big new developments they risk going into decline in the near future,"" he said. oil sector setbacks  
&gt;  
&gt;the kurdish region has proven oil reserves of less than 3 billion barrels at most, based on the most optimistic forecast, according to the krg source, only a tiny fraction of iraq's overall proven reserves of more than 140 billion barrels.  
&gt;  
&gt;and the region's energy sector has faced a number of recent setbacks.  
&gt;  
&gt;an iraqi federal supreme court ruling in february deemed the legal foundations of the oil and gas sector in the region to be unconstitutional, forcing some foreign firms, including u.s. oilfield services companies schlumberger (slb.n), baker hughes (bkr.o) and halliburton (hal.n), to leave read more  
&gt;  
&gt;the upcoming decision in an arbitration case dating back to 2014 between turkey and iraq about the oil export pipeline that runs between the two countries is also sending ripples of uncertainty through foreign firms still in the kurdish region.  
&gt;  
&gt;iraq claims turkey has violated an agreement by giving the kurdish region access to the pipeline without baghdad's approval.  
&gt;  
&gt;the final hearing at the international chamber of commerce in paris was in july and there will be a final decision in the next few months, according to iraq's oil ministry and sources familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;foreign oil investors first came to kurdistan in the era of former iraqi president saddam hussein, when the region was considered more stable and secure than the rest of iraq.  
&gt;  
&gt;but the region's star has started to fade, with the big foreign firms deterred by tensions between the region and the central government in iraq, a string of downgrades to iraqi kurdistan's oil reserves and security problems.  
&gt;  
&gt;now kurdistan only has a handful of small and medium-sized operators, many of which complain about the difficult operating environment. if the investment environment does not improve kurdistan risks further withdrawals.
