1667329904,"&gt;japan has decided to retain its stake in the new russian operator of the sakhalin-1 oil and gas project and has asked japanese consortium members to stay to ensure the country's energy security, the industry minister said on tuesday.

&gt;""the sakhalin-1 is extremely important for japan's energy security as it is a valuable source outside of the middle east,"" industry minister yasutoshi nishimura told a news conference, citing that japan was highly dependent on middle east crude oil.

&gt;""japanese government has decided to keep its stakes in the project,"" he said, adding he met executives of sakhalin oil and gas development co (sodeco), a consortium of japanese firms holding 30% stake in the formerly exxon-led project, on monday and urged them to consider joining the new russian entity.

&gt;russian president vladimir putin last month issued a decree to establish a new operator for the formerly exxon mobil-led project, authorising the kremlin to decide whether foreign shareholders could retain stakes in sakhalin-1. exxon (xom.n) fully exited russia after moscow ""unilaterally terminated"" its interests in the project.",2,,chakokat,0

here's my two cents:

* **$cop:** entry was during an impulse leg and not a retracement. where was your stop? if you can't find a pullback on the 5-min, [go down to the 2-min for a better entry.](https://i.imgur.com/dk7ie65.png) although it was strong, i avoid buying so close to resistance (hod). as for profit target at ath, you can trail the 20 ma on the 5-min.
* **$esty**: same idea as above‚Äîbought during a big momentum bar. personally, i wouldn't have traded around here because of the $100 whole number and [prior unfilled gap which trapped price the entire day.](https://i.imgur.com/ng7wxu8.png) the daily chart not the best looking either.
* **$sq:** looks like fomo. [check the daily and note that 51.45 was the low of the year.](https://i.imgur.com/u5q8geh.png) price bounced off it hard with high volume. that means buyers showed up to defend. i avoid going short when price holds/bounces off support like that. you want to see support become resistance during a re-test.

hopefully that is helpful. cheers :)",5,,Cranky_Crypto,0

1667668239,"excellent reflections from u/gfp, my favorite user of the cobf forum: 

q3 results are out.  another quarter with only $1b in repurchases will disappoint some.  insurance float up $3b to $150 billion (will rise by $13.5 billion to $163.5 with alleghany included).  geico had $600 million of losses from hurricane ian but the biggest problem for geico is that customers are leaving when it increases rates, and it isn't even increasing rates as much as it needs to.  geico has now been putting up underwriting losses steadily and has slashed advertising and expense ratio.  berkshire reinsurance only had $1.9 billion in ian losses - a very good result showing that berkshire has really pulled back from cat reinsurance.  companywide, ian was a $3.4 billion pretax, $2.7 billion after tax loss.  brk's q3 effective tax rate is over 37% - a short term blip but i guess they can stop writing articles about how brk will be the biggest loser from the 15% minimum tax on book profit bill.

 

oxy will be equity method accounted but with a one quarter lag, so q4 will include a partial q3's worth of oxy earnings.  no oxy earnings included in this release.  gains on oxy stock are not going to increase our book value going forward, similar to kraft (if kraft ever had gains..).  the oxy warrants will still be marked to market (or more accurately 'marked to model') each quarter, so those gains will show up.

 

looks like berkshire didn't change the apple holdings and purchased an additional $880m-ish worth of chevron stock.  berkshire sold $4.7 billion of cost basis holdings from the banks, insurance &amp; finance category in the quarter.  it wasn't bac or axp obviously.

 

berkshire's equity put derivatives are almost completely behind us.  berkshire's corporate borrowings are a thing of beauty with the foreign currency borrowings all looking like yet another version of negative cost float over their lifetimes.

* occidental petroleum just released earnings that vastly surpassed gaap earnings expectations.
* it's tempting to think that occidental petroleum stock is getting overheated, but it's still ""cheap"" in valuation terms.
* i've been holding occidental petroleum since $55 and i wouldn't exit anywhere lower than $80.
* the u.s. spr release will probably end after the midterms.
* we could see gains in oil prices and in oil stocks like occidental petroleum if that happens.

occidental petroleum corporation (nyse:oxy) just released its third quarter earnings. the release showed a large beat on gaap earnings and a very slight miss on normalized earnings. the release exceeded expectations overall, as oxy received many downgrades during the third quarter, which saw oil prices fall.

oxy has been one of this year‚Äôs best performing oil stocks. up 144% for the year, it is outperforming the oil sector, which is really saying something because oil is outperforming every other sector this year.

oxy has a number of advantages over other oil companies. these advantages are taking its price higher. for one thing, it has the blessing of warren buffett, who owns so much oxy he‚Äôs now accounting for it through the equity method. news that buffett owns a stock has been known to move markets, and he has bought enough oxy at this point (over 20%) that he is supporting the price by making the float smaller.

for another thing, oxy got beaten down so badly in the 2020 oil bear market that high growth from the weak base period was pretty easy to achieve. in 2020, oxy ran a truly staggering $17 per share loss. it also had an enormous pile of debt. when you‚Äôve got that kind of weakness in your past history, it‚Äôs not hard to look better in the future. so, it‚Äôs not surprising that oxy is now rising faster than other oil companies. it‚Äôs paying off debt and generally getting rid of the things that made it such a catastrophe two and a half years ago. as we saw in oxy‚Äôs third quarter release, that's paying off. that bodes well for the company‚Äôs future earnings.

it‚Äôs natural at this stage in the game to worry that oxy‚Äôs rally is getting long in the tooth. personally, i think the low hanging fruit has been picked; the stock may not be a ‚Äúmulti-bagger‚Äù from these levels. it does, however, have a valuation that suggests long term upside even if you assume that oil prices fall a bit from today‚Äôs levels. for this reason i consider oxy a moderate buy; a basically above-average stock, though not the mind-blowing opportunity it once was.

occidental petroleum - earnings recap

occidental petroleum‚Äôs recent earnings release was better than expected. in the release, the company revealed:

* $2.52 in diluted gaap eps, a significant beat (the estimate was for $2.41).
* $4.3 billion in cash from continuing operations.
* $3.6 billion in free cash flow.
* $1.8 billion in debt repayment.
* $1.8 billion in buybacks.

it was a pretty decent showing all around. the earnings were pretty decent, and the continued debt repayment points to a path to improved profitability in the future. the lower your debt, the lower your interest expense, which can result in a profit jump in later periods even if oil prices only stay flat. it‚Äôs very hard to say where oil prices will head from today‚Äôs level. the end of the spr release and opec production cuts point to lower supply and higher prices, but the fed‚Äôs continued rate hiking may reduce demand. so, occidental‚Äôs debt reduction bodes well. it‚Äôs not clear that oil prices will keep rising forever, and oxy has taken steps to ensure profitability despite that.

why oxy did so well this year

as we saw earlier today, oxy‚Äôs latest earnings release was pretty strong. the release was only one of several good ones from the company this year, and companies putting out impressive earnings tend to see their stock prices appreciate. however, that doesn‚Äôt explain why oxy has done so much better than other oil companies. the vast majority of oil companies have been growing this year, and xle (the energy sector etf) is up 63%. so, why is oxy doing so much better than its peers?

setting aside speculation about a possible buyout by berkshire hathaway (brk.a, brk.b), one factor driving oxy‚Äôs returns is the sheer weakness in the company‚Äôs base period. in its 2020 annual report, oxy reported a staggering $17 per share loss, and $35 billion in debt. the debt was nearly double shareholders' equity at the time, and nearly ten times operating cash flows. it was a pretty scary situation, which is why buffett initially invested in oxy through preferred stock and warrants rather than common stock. but later, oil prices rallied to extreme highs and oxy paid off a lot of its debt. in the second quarter, it was able to grow its earnings by $3.6 billion year-over-year.

so, oxy‚Äôs stock price rose faster than other oil stocks because of weakness in the base period. in economics, there is a concept called ‚Äúbase effects,‚Äù which says that inflation is likely to be slower after a fast growth period and vice versa. the same concept applies to corporate earnings. a company that starts at $10 in earnings and grows to $11 in earnings, grows at 10%. a company that starts at $10 in earnings and grows to $12, grows at 20%. both companies end up with $12 in earnings, but the latter one grows faster. if it‚Äôs publicly listed, its stock price probably goes up faster too.

&gt; 
&gt; the easing of the oil sanctions come as the venezuelan government and the democratic opposition re-started talks, brokered by norway and mexico. the talks between the two sides are the first direct contact in a year | #oott
&gt; 
&gt; a bit of extra context: before the sanctions were imposed, the joint-ventures between chevron and pdvsa, the venezuelan state-owned oil company, pumped about 200,000 b/d. so that's probably as much extra crude as we can expect -- and that will require time, money and expertise
&gt; 
&gt; another interesting tidbit of the ‚Äúgeneral license‚Äù that washington gave today to chevron: it only allows $cvx to export the crude oil it pumps in venezuela into the united states (and nowhere else). #oott

some of this was already potentially in the works, but its likely been spurred forward as a policy, [given saudi arabia cutting production right before the midterms to help republicans and help the russians](https://theintercept.com/2022/10/20/saudi-oil-production-cut/). a more diversified set of oil producers lessens the shock that any one producer can have. 

and also spurred on by [florida turning so far right.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-florida.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=statenavmenu) 

when florida was a competitive state, tailoring foreign policy to the emigre communities of cubans, venezuelans and others was a big concern to win florida's seats and ec votes. but with florida now a safe republican state, and those emigres siding strongly with republicans, democratic politicians can now develop a foreign policy based on the best interest, not winning votes.

maximum pressure tactics against cuba and venezuela clearly don't actually work. it doesn't lead to a regime change, it just punishes the people. so it's a very good sign that biden is taking this step.

1669573753,"buffett's berkshire hathaway discloses $4.1 billion tsmc stake  
[by jonathan stempel](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/buffetts-berkshire-discloses-big-taiwan-semi-stake-2022-11-14/)

  
nov 14 (reuters) - berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n) said it bought more than $4.1 billion of stock in taiwan semiconductor manufacturing (2330.tw), , a rare significant foray into the technology sector by billionaire warren buffett's conglomerate.  
the news sent shares in tsmc soaring, closing up 7.9% in taiwan on tuesday, as it boosted investor sentiment for the world's largest contract chipmaker, which saw its shares hit a two-year low last month due to a sharp slowdown in global chip demand.

tsmc's other foreign investors include u.s. asset managers blackrock inc (blk.n) and vanguard group inc, and singapore sovereign wealth fund gic (gic.ul).  
berkshire also disclosed new stakes of $297 million in building materials company louisiana-pacific corp (lpx.n) and $13 million in jefferies financial group inc (jef.n). it exited an investment in store capital corp (stor.n), a real estate company that agreed in september to be taken private.  
the filing did not specify whether buffett or his portfolio managers todd combs and ted weschler made specific purchases and sales. investors often try to piggy back on what berkshire buys. larger investments are normally buffett's.  
while berkshire does not normally make big technology bets, it often prefers companies it perceives to have competitive advantages, often through their size.  
tsmc, which makes chips for the likes of apple inc (aapl.o), qulacomm (qcom.o) and nvidia corp (nvda.o), posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit last month, but struck a more cautious note than usual on upcoming demand.

""i suspect berkshire has a belief that the world cannot do without the products manufactured by taiwan semi,"" said tom russo, a partner at gardner, russo &amp; quinn in lancaster, pennsylvania, which owns berkshire shares.  
""only a small number of companies that can amass the capital to deliver semiconductors, which are increasingly central to people's lives,"" he added.  
berkshire has had mixed success in technology.  
its more than six-year wager during the last decade in ibm corp (ibm.n) did not pan out, but berkshire is sitting on huge unrealized gains on its $126.5 billion stake in apple, which buffett views more as a consumer products company.  
apple is by far the largest investment in berkshire's $306.2 billion equity portfolio.  
berkshire disclosed the tsmc stake about 2-1/2 months after it began reducing a decade-old, multi-billion dollar stake in byd co (002594.sz), china's largest electric car company.  
in the third quarter, berkshire added to its stakes in chevron corp (cvx.n), occidental petroleum corp (oxy.n), celanese corp (ce.n), paramount global (para.o) and rh (rh.n).  
it also sold shares of activision blizzard inc (atvi.o), bank of new york mellon corp (bk.n), general motors co (gm.n), kroger co (kr.n) and us bancorp (usb.n).  
buffett, 92, has run berkshire since 1965. the omaha, nebraska-based company also owns dozens of businesses such as the bnsf railroad, the geico auto insurer, several energy and industrial companies, fruit of the loom and dairy queen.",1,,JeebusBuiltMyHotRod,0

&gt; # [venezuelan political talks set to enter challenging phase -opposition delegate](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/3amicwtrzylt_sq2a5imfhfp_hc=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80\)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/jumvdfnuibld7a5ug5ueenhgwq.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; caracas, nov 28 (reuters) - talks between the venezuelan government and the country's opposition, which resumed over the weekend, are set to enter a crucial stage, the head of dialogue for venezuela's opposition said on monday, as the political rivals seek to end a prolonged economic crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; ""now is when negotiations get tough,"" gerardo blyde, who leads the team of negotiators for venezuela's opposition, said in an interview with local radio station circuitos exitos.
&gt; 
&gt; the talks are ongoing but do not have a fixed schedule as yet. the discussions are held in mexico city and are mediated by norway.
&gt; 
&gt; the opposition will seek to meet with the venezuelan government again before the end of the year to discuss human rights, political prisoners and other topics including ""electoral conditions,"" blyde said.
&gt; 
&gt; delegates for president nicolas maduro and the opposition [met in mexico city saturday](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelas-frozen-funds-be-gradually-released-humanitarian-aid-2022-11-26/) to resume formal talks after a hiatus of more than a year.
&gt; 
&gt; the parties signed a ""social agreement,"" asking the united nations to manage the venezuelan money currently frozen in international accounts in a fund to be used for aid purposes, reportedly totaling [some $3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/exclusive-un-could-administer-over-3-bln-funds-aid-venezuela-2022-10-25/).
&gt; 
&gt; the agreement ""is not the solution,"" however, said blyde, describing it as a ""palliative"" step.
&gt; 
&gt; the $3 billion is not enough to meet venezuela's needs, he said, adding that once the fund is created, the plan is to dole out the cash in phases, taking around three years.
&gt; 
&gt; a date has not been set to create the fund, which will be used to make improvements to the electric grid, hospitals and schools in the nation where around half live in poverty.
&gt; 
&gt; blyde also said the administration of u.s. president joe biden had been key in getting the venezuelan government back to the table by easing some washington-imposed sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; u.s. oil company chevron corp [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) also [received an expanded license](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-issues-expanded-license-allow-chevron-import-venezuelan-petroleum-2022-11-26/) on saturday, allowing it to resume oil production in the south american country and bring venezuelan crude to the united states.
&gt; 
&gt; the decision gives broader freedom to chevron, the last large u.s. oil producer operating in venezuela, though it restricts the company from paying royalties in the country.
