you concede they‚Äôre making record profits but you ‚Äúdisagree with most of that opinion?‚Äù not following.

you keep posting that map despite the fact that it proves nothing in and of itself. the west is an anomaly because our pipelines are relatively isolated from the rest of the network. this makes us more sensitive to refinery slowdowns. sure, you could parrot ‚Äúdrill baby drill‚Äù and ‚Äújust build more refineries‚Äù as an easy solution, but to what end? are 20 refineries enough? 50? 100? should we just litter huntington beach in oil derricks again like it‚Äôs the 1930s, because heaven forbid we regulate fuel production or crude extraction?

&gt;moscow/houston, oct 7 (reuters) - russian president vladimir putin has signed a decree, published on friday, to set up a new operator for the sakhalin 1 oil and gas project, following similar steps to seize other oil and gas projects with foreign participation.

&gt;exxon mobil corp (xom.n), with a 30% stake, was the operator of sakhalin-1, a development in russia's far east. the largest u.s. producer has been trying to exit russia operations since march, days after moscow's invasion of ukraine. exxon declined to comment on friday's decree.

&gt;in april, exxon took a $4.6 billion impairment charge for exiting its russian activities, leaving sakhalin-1 operation open for a takeover from a partner. it also proceeded to reduce oil and gas production volumes and remove personnel from the country.

&gt;in august, putin issued the presidential decree 520 which exxon said impedes the company to conclude the exit safely. the producer then escalated the dispute and issued a note of difference that could ultimately end up in an arbitration process.

1665466062,"## india will weigh what russia has to offer on sakhalin-1 ownership revamp

by marianna parraga and gary mcwilliams

houston, oct 10 (reuters) - india maintains a ""healthy dialogue"" with russia and will look at what is offered following an announced ownership revamp to the sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, petroleum minister hardeep singh puri told reuters.

russia last week [issued a decree allowing it to seize exxon mobil's 30% stake ](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-setting-up-new-operator-sakhalin-1-tass-2022-10-07/) and gave a russian state-run company the authority to decide whether foreign shareholders including india's ongc videsh (onvi.ns) can retain their participation in the project.

""we‚Äôll look at what is the state of play and what‚Äôs on offer,"" petroleum minister hardeep singh puri told reuters in an interview on monday following meetings with u.s. oil executives in houston.

india is ""actively monitoring"" saudi arabia's asia premium over oil prices after opec+ last week agreed to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day beginning next month, puri said.

""at the end of the day, consumers start playing a role when situations like this evolve,‚Äù he said referring to global energy balance and the ""unintended consequences"" of the opec+ decision. too high oil prices could exacerbate inflation and tip the global economy in recession, reducing oil demand, he added.

on the proposed european union price cap on russian oil purchases, he suggested it is not yet firm. ‚Äúif the europeans come with a plan, let‚Äôs see how it evolves,"" he said.

puri this week met u.s. energy secretary jennifer granholm and energy security adviser amos hochstein in washington, where they discussed collaborations on biofuels and clean energy in addition to energy security.

""at no stage have we ever been told not to buy russian oil,"" he said, referring to talks with officials on global energy supplies.

in houston, he met executives from exxon mobil (xom.n), oilfield service provider baker hughes (bkr.o), and with liquefied natural gas producers after launching a bidding round for offshore oil and gas exploration areas.

india is interested in the u.s companies' technical expertise in offshore production, ethanol and sulfur recovery in oil refineries, puri added.

""for getting to green energy, you have to survive the present,"" he said.

tbh its likely some government intervention as well. the opec decision last week and higher than expected cpi figures should have had a far larger impact. throw on top expected increases in official interest rates for the next year or two and the markets should be tumbling faster than expected.

growth stocks are going to be hard to continue their meteoric gains of the last 2.5 years.
any shipping related activities are going to get more expensive - so retail will struggle with higher costs and lower revenue.

only the oil industry will benefit in the near term. look at $xom - pumped from mid to high 80's to over 100 a share since the opec announcement.

*however, we urge investors not to buy into such rhetoric, as the actual reduction could be much less. furthermore, street analysts have yet to factor in a global recession.
we explain why oxy remains ominously perched, with a steeper decline looking increasingly likely. we also discuss why wall street is still too optimistic, heading into a recession.*

*hence, we urge investors to use the recent rally to cut more exposure and let the overly-optimistic buyers take their shares from them at the current levels.
after the street has gone into a panic, it would likely be appropriate to move in and scoop up the shares at a much lower price from weak holders fleeing for the hills*",1,,qwertz238,0

1666646067,"and some good news for oil and gas investors from schlumberger's ceo, olivier le peuch.  after beating on both lines, he had this to say about the state of oil field services going forward:

*turning now to the macro. we have strengthened our view in a multiyear upcycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth. despite concerns over the slowdown of global growth rates and the potential for recession, the fundamentals for energy as a critical resource remain very constructive.*  


* *first, in the near term, a seasonal uptick in demand as winter approaches is pitted against a very intricate supply landscape for both oil and gas through the end of the year. this situation is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crisis in europe. looking further out into the horizon, the demand-supply picture remains delicate, with this imbalance amplified by geopolitics, increased instances of supply disruptions and limited spare global capacity.*
* *second, the growing necessity of energy security and supply-source diversification will also bring -- also drive urgent increases in energy investment. a significant step-up in investment is required to create supply redundancies, rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth.*
* *and third, recent opec+ decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation -- operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions. taken together, these dynamics will result in a supply-led upcycle characterized by resilient upstream investment that is decoupled from near-term demand volatility.*  


*we expect investment growth will be durable, reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory, multi-year capacity expansion plans, lower operating breakeven prices and supportive commodity prices. growth will be simultaneous in north america and in the international markets. this started first in the north america market, and we are already witnessing the next phase of growth with an acceleration in pace in the offshore and international markets that was very visible in the third quarter.*  
(source: transcript, linked below)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

despite the higher cost of capital, i am encouraged about multi year expansion plans plus all the work to remove cost has lowered break even prices for producers on a sustainable basis.  really a huge positive in my opinion.  $slb's q3 eps was the highest it's been since q4 2015.

cffo = $1.6b; fcf = $1.1b; expecting to exceed  fy guidance.

&gt; # [venezuela's oil partners head for the exit, forgoing unpaid debt](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/5e1lqjeq4qqd_iydlihhxhuv8da=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80\)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ev72sqncsznqxfgmdcmxevcm5q.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; cabimas, venezuela, oct 27 (reuters) - venezuela is allowing partners in state oil company pdvsa's joint ventures to leave - by selling their shares to others or returning them - so long as they forgo payment for past debts and unpaid dividends, four people close to the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; having to take a loss or relinquish unpaid debt has not stopped companies like france's totalenergies [(ttef.pa)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ttef.pa), norway's equinor [(eqnr.ol)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/eqnr.ol), and japan's inpex [(1605.t)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/1605.t) from leaving. their departure illustrates how u.s. sanctions on the energy sector have made operating in the country with the most crude reserves untenable, leading to idle oilfields.
&gt; 
&gt; eight foreign companies among pdvsa's 44 joint ventures have transferred or given up stakes since 2018. another seven smaller firms no longer have a presence in venezuela and 15 projects are inactive, even though those partners technically remain, an internal pdvsa document seen by reuters showed.
&gt; 
&gt; ""none of those stakes are recoverable at book value,"" said an oil executive whose firm left venezuela by selling to a another company last year. ""among those remaining in the partnerships, few hope to ever recoup pending dividends or commercial debts from pdvsa.""
&gt; 
&gt; more than three years of harsh u.s. sanctions on pdvsa have restricted access to capital and cashflow and have limited the markets receiving venezuelan oil, taking a toll on the mostly foreign minority stakeholders, their operations and workers.
&gt; 
&gt; since totalenergies and equinor in 2021 exited one of venezuela's flagship oil upgrading projects, petrocedeno, smaller firms have followed.
&gt; 
&gt; the french company reported a loss of $1.38 billion from transferring its 30% stake to a pdvsa unit. it received ""a symbolic amount"" for its assets, chief executive patrick pouyann√© said at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; the transfer freed total of past and future liabilities from its venezuela projects. but dividends and debts owed by petrocedeno to the partners also were wiped out, two people familiar with the matter said.
&gt; 
&gt; inpex last year sold stakes in two venezuelan assets to private equity firm sucre energy group, and returned a stake in a third project to pdvsa. accounts receivable and owed dividends were transferred to sucre as part of the transaction, but at a heavily discounted value, a person involved in the transaction said.
&gt; 
&gt; the departures highlight the risks of doing business with cash-strapped pdvsa and the few legal avenues available to companies that have not been paid.
&gt; 
&gt; equinor declined to disclose details of the transaction, but confirmed in an email the company has no remaining activity in the country. inpex, total and pdvsa did not reply to requests for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; ## what about the workers?
&gt; 
&gt; some companies losing staff in venezuela or dealing with labor claims, including venezuelan oil firm suelopetrol and gpb global resources, have discovered pdvsa appointed new joint venture managers or took over their operations.
&gt; 
&gt; gpb global resources, a stakeholder in the petrozamora joint venture, in september lost operational control on the ground of its projects, even though it had not been informed on a takeover nor received any compensation from pdvsa, the company said.
&gt; 
&gt; ""there is a very substantial debt owed by the petrozamora joint venture to a subsidiary of gpb global resources,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it intends to pursue ""all available avenues of recourse"" against pdvsa, venezuela or any third party that may acquire the shares or assets.
&gt; 
&gt; a worker from petrozamora who asked not to be identified said staff has not been paid completely. ""days ago, an official passed by and said the company had not respected its contract with pdvsa.""
&gt; 
&gt; suelopetrol declined to comment on talks with pdvsa, but said the company remains committed to venezuela, with assets and staff in place.
&gt; 
&gt; with companies and workers leaving almost en masse, the abandonment of oilfields is visible near maracaibo lake, among venezuela's oldest producing region. its oil output keeps falling, outages became routine and some workers are on the verge of starvation.
&gt; 
&gt; ""a month ago, they tried to restart a small rig and it caused an explosion that sent crude to people's houses,"" said a neighbor of maracaibo's cabimas oilfield, his feet stained with oil.
&gt; 
&gt; from over 110,000 workers a decade ago, pdvsa's workforce has dropped to about 60,000 people, said daniel delgado, a union leader at the tia juana oilfield.
&gt; 
&gt; ""we are risking our lives to get an oil barrel out by working in unsafe conditions, without proper equipment or medical assistance. it's a high price,"" delgado said.
&gt; 
&gt; between 2019 and 2021, pdvsa delivered oil cargoes to partners to reduce outstanding debt.
&gt; 
&gt; eni [(eni.mi)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/eni.mi) and repsol [(rep.mc)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/rep.mc) this summer received 3.6 million barrels in a temporary resumption of oil-for-debt, but nothing since then. chevron [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) has proposed to the u.s. government [it be allowed to recoup its debts](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/washington-plays-hardball-with-chevrons-venezuela-license-over-mexico-talks-2022-10-18/) through an expanded license, yet pending.
&gt; 
&gt; ""almost none of the companies that have left the country have been given that benefit,"" said an oil industry representative, who declined to be identified.
&gt; 
&gt; the departures have hit oil service providers and contractors the hardest, said the venezuelan petroleum chamber, whose members fell to 300 from 500 in the last four years.
&gt; 
&gt; venezuela last year fell short of reaching its oil production goal. and so far this year output has stalled at about 725,000 barrels per day (bpd), well below its year-end target of 2 million bpd.
&gt; 
&gt; to further increase production would require pdvsa to honor past debts, said enrique novoa, the chamber's president, adding: ""sanctions also must be eased, at least partially.""
