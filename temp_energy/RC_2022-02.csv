[well, you see, profit, uh, finds a way.  but i do agree that we are going to be living through very interesting times. the next major world war (which hopefully won't ever happen but... you know) will be devastating.  even without a war, the earth's climate is changing, the world population growth is grinding to a halt (and might actually start declining in the 2050s or so).  it's difficult to imagine which countries are going to be doing the best in the next 80 years. did the us already peak? did europe already peak? are india and china (or both) going to be the main drivers of the world economy in the next century? they both have massive populations which means they would be way more sensitive to food security issues (due to climate change or any number of unforeseen events). but they also have massive populations of consumers who all want the latest gadgets and their own vehicles (like people in the usa and europe and other places). or maybe the whole world itself will kind of become one more inter-connected economy and we'll all be lifting all the other countries up or something.  i personally think investing in some of these lab-grown meat, lab-grown-cheese, or insects-for-food companies would be a good idea because i see them growing huge in the next 50 years, i'm just not sure where to get started because a lot of them are private companies. even if you discount climate change or animal rights affecting people's purchasing decisions, pure economics will dictate that lab grown meat and cheese will be cheaper than regular meat, because of much lower production costs.  and obviously electric cars are going to be the future, but i doubt any one particular company will dominate that field. tesla kind of has a head start, but other companies already have tons of workers and factories too, and they've been making cars for decades now.  anyway yeah who knows.](/r/stocks/comments/sgedvt/listening_to_market_expert_analyses_feels/huwbfib/)

[nvda may have some issues coming down the pike but as far as i know, nvidia's ceo hasn't testified before congress about election interference and there haven't been any whistle blowers talking about harm done to child psychology from use of it's products.  there's also a lot of supply chain aspects that will allow nvda to charge more for gpus whereas facebook relies on advertising and data collection for something like 90% of it's revenue.  facebook just stands to lose a lot more money and has a worse business outlook which explains why they had such a massive stock drop considering they are looking at losing multiple revenue streams and user bases considering the eu privacy issues and apple preventing them from harvesting data on their platforms. nvidia has a lot of growth potential coming from multiple areas and there are a lot of ways they can offset any potential lost business from failed acquisitions by charging more for their products. fb doesn't have a product based business so they aren't as insulated. fb also operating in multiple areas like vr where they have lost billions of dollars year to year.  bottom line is nvda is running a product based business whereas fb's business model is data based and is totally reliant on them being able to harvest data on appl and google platforms, capabilities which are getting curtailed. nvda doesn't have those limitations. fb signs point to loss of business in multiple categories.  nvda also operating in semiconductors which has growth potential in many areas. only going to get more important over time. they can grow their business without having to rely on acquisitions alone.  anyone buying vr headsets or planning on signing up for the metaverse?](/r/stocks/comments/so26m6/fb_officially_worth_less_than_nvda/hw6l8q1/)

[unlike all other commenters here, i'm bullish. the current valuation means there's an opportunity here for a huge upside. first, if you check their latest er, unlike fb or pinterest, twitter's user base is growing (q3: 187m to 211m yoy), esp internationally. us user base is flat which is not a good sign but at least it's not shrinking like pinterest's. the biggest problem for twitter rn is that they are losing a ton of money. twitter's new ceo will have to cut costs while increasing revenue (q3: up 37% yoy) so that investors can see a path towards profitability. i think it's pretty doable with revenue surpassing $5b annually.   the other potential upside is an acquisition. twitter's current valuation is $27b. if microsoft offered $51b for pinterest, twitter is worth at least as much as it has way more potential. a bid from microsoft or even google doesn't sound that crazy if the stock will keep tumbling.

[wondering who is really to blame for the collapse of pton stock. is it the ceo, or the investors, or a combination? i think it's a combination. a blind man could have seen that the growth of pton was due to people not being able to go to a gym and that this was always going to be temporary. if the ceo and the rest of the executive at pton thought otherwise, they were fools. if investors, and i'm not talking about people buying 100 shares, i'm talking the fund managers, didn't see this for what it is, they should be out of a job as well. all this stock was ever good for was catching it at the right time in the early days of the pandemic and selling after doubling or tripling your money. i have owned a peloton bike for 5 or 6 years now and i was not foolish enough to buy into the idea that this growth was limited for a number of reasons, the smallest being the pandemic. i think the cost of the bike and the monthly fees are bigger inhibitors than people being stuck inside for the better part of a year.   the other nail in their coffin is remote work. i initially purchased my pton bike because of my schedule. i used to get up for work between 4:30 and 5:00 am, to catch a 5:30 train to nyc, and then get home around 6:00 pm. last thing i wanted to do was get changed and go to a gym at the same time everyone else was, then eat dinner at 8:00 pm. so i got the bike. but i've been working remotely for going on 2 years. once i feel comfortable enough to join a gym, i will. how many other people did the same thing as i did? got a bike because they didn't have time in their day to go to a gym, but now they do.](/r/stocks/comments/snhagh/peloton_ceo_john_foley_to_step_down_transition_to/hw2x1su/)

1644584183,"this is from a dividend growth point of view, i own all of these so there's a bit of bias, but the takeaway is to find a company that will be boring and safe with good fundamentals.

healthcare: $jnj- not weighed down by the threat of patent expiration (at least to an extent of other beloved companies in the sector), has a pretty good moat with medical treatment products.

consumer cyclicals: $kmb- massive moat and product line, paper-based products like diapers, tissues, and tp; pretty much always going to be bought. $ko or $pep- large food and drinks product lines, something people will almost always buy, either as a treat or daily life foodstuff.

energy: $xom or $cvx- both are your run off the mill large oil companies looking into expanding into green energy as well, with pretty good plans as well.

real estate: $o- safe, pretty popular, and grows rather well. not much to say past that.

financials: $trow- has something like $1.5 trillion of assets being managed, recently took a pretty big hit just for a bad protection of future growth, so pretty appealing.

industrials: $lmt- could see some growth from whatever comes out of the russia-ukraine situation. also very safe with how our military budget is.

communications: $t- is pretty much this or $vz but verizon has pretty subpar growth, and $t had the potential spinoff with discovery. keep an eye on whether or not it's a spinoff or split off though.",2,,SurfaceToAsh,0

1645141219,"he obtained a judgment against chevron in ecuador by bribing experts to write expert reports for him and bribing one of the judges presiding over the case.

when he tried to get that judgment enforced in the us, a us court ruled that the judgment was obtained through fraud and could not be enforced. the judge who was allegedly bribed, guerra, testified in this us hearing about the bribery. the judge presiding over the hearing noted that guerra was an unreliable witness, and specifically said in his ruling that even without guerra's testimony, there was cleat evidence that donziger's ecuador judgment was fraudulent.

after that ruling, donziger appealed his case to the 2nd circuit court of appeals. they ruled against him, and again specifically noted that even though it wasn't their job to review the factual evidence against donziger, that evidence clearly indicated in their opinion that the original ecaudor judgment was fraudulent. donziger was also disbarred over this. several international courts have also recognized that the ecuador judgment was fraudulent. in addition to that, many of the counternarratives that paint donziger in a good light - for example, the idea that the us judge who ruled against him had ""direct ties to chevron"" - are pretty much bullshit. in actuality, that judge just owned some shares in a mutual fund which happened to be invested in chevron stock. donziger spends almost all of his time raising money and doing media appearances to sell his side of the story, which is why a lot of pro-donziger narratives have seaped into the public consciousness.

however, don't think i'm only on chevron's side here: they have definitely gone to great lengths to try and punish donziger, especially in the criminal contempt case that he's currently serving time for. they're definitely invested in making his life hell, and possibly colluded with the prosecutor in that case. but that doesn't mean that donziger is ""in the right"". and the biggest wrinkle in the facts of the case is that guerra later went on to claim that he was *not* bribed by donziger, and was in fact bribed by chevron to testify against donziger. overall, there are no heroes in this situation. chevron is an evil megacompany trying to do anything they can to avoid culpability for their environmental destruction, and donziger is a crooked lawyer who tried to cheat his way into a historically monumentous win in court, got burned for it, and now spends all his time trying to gaslight people into thinking he's the victim of a grand conspiracy rather than someone who flouted the legal system from the beginning.",-4,,Mirrormn,0

1645162247,"i voted for the mc-101 because it was on the list (and i have one) but i third recommend the mpc one, especially if you can find a used one for sround $500. the mpc is way more flexible, plus, you can just get the free version of zenology(or just pay $20 for one month for the pro version and then get rid of it) and auto-sample all the best presets from it and put them in your mpc one. 


and i'll elaborate on why you want to do that. i have both the mc-101 and the mpc live. while the mpc is an incredible sequencer and sampler, the mc-101 destroys it in terms of diversity of stock sounds. the mc-101 has a very limited sequencer, only 4 tracks, no triplets and 16th notes together, and extremely limited sampling capabilities. with the mpc, you get the hype and tubesynth, but neither of these compare to the amazing high quality and diversity of stock presets in the mc-101. 


since i have both, i upgraded to zenology pro so that i can make custom presets and drums in the software and easily transfer them to my mc-101, but after much discovery, i found out that i can directly auto-sample the presets from zenology to the mpc. this allows me to make extremely high quality unique sounds (i've made 808s, synths, guitar sounds, etc. that the mpc stock library is missing) and transfer them to the mpc as keygroups so that i can play them with a midi keyboard. by having the roland sound library combined with the sampling and sequencing capabilities of the mpc, you have an extremely powerful (and portable if you get a battery for it) machine that gives you all the flexibility of a $3000 workstation, but without the price tag or weight. (the zen-core engine in the mc-101 is the exact same engine as the new roland fantom, but costs a fraction of the price)",1,,KaoticShock,0

soaring oil industry profits are costing consumers at the gas pump

[https://www.upr.org/utah-news/2021-12-15/soaring-oil-industry-profits-are-costing-consumers-at-the-gas-pump](https://www.upr.org/utah-news/2021-12-15/soaring-oil-industry-profits-are-costing-consumers-at-the-gas-pump)

&amp;#x200b;

exclusive: oil companies’ profits soared to $174bn this year as us gas prices rose  
this article is more than 2 months old  
exxon, chevron, shell and bp among group of 24 who resisted calls to increase production but doled out shareholder dividends

[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/06/oil-companies-profits-exxon-chevron-shell-exclusive](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/06/oil-companies-profits-exxon-chevron-shell-exclusive)

&amp;#x200b;

chevron corp (cvx.n) on friday posted its highest quarterly profit in eight years on surging oil and gas prices, higher output and a recovery in motor fuel demand that boosted refining margins.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-posts-highest-profit-eight-years-surging-oil-gas-prices-2021-10-29/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-posts-highest-profit-eight-years-surging-oil-gas-prices-2021-10-29/)

&amp;#x200b;

profits soared at the nation's two largest oil companies, as exxonmobil and chevron both benefited from the recent run-up in oil prices.

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/29/energy/exxonmobil-chevron-profits/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/29/energy/exxonmobil-chevron-profits/index.html)

&amp;#x200b;

exxon, chevron report billions in profits but plan to keep spending tight  
despite strong turnaround as some economies recover from the pandemic the oil giants  
restrain spending to draw back investors

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-posts-highest-profit-in-a-year-as-oil-demand-rebounds-11627640325](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-posts-highest-profit-in-a-year-as-oil-demand-rebounds-11627640325)

&amp;#x200b;

surging oil prices will add to producers’ revenue, but profits will be super-charged by executives determined to constrain capital spending on new output, the oslo-based consultant said in a note

[https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/oil-producers-to-make-record-profits-this-year-report-11624461868705.html](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/oil-producers-to-make-record-profits-this-year-report-11624461868705.html)

&amp;#x200b;

shell’s profit jumps, riding higher prices for oil and natural gas.  
europe’s largest energy company said it would use some of the earnings to buy back more shares and increase its dividend.

risk adjusted future cash flows = future earnings divided by risk free rate (interest rate).  

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;cash is more attractive. if you had moved to cash in december you’d be a lot wealthier than you are today. you could also hedge. you could also find a few sectors that have reasonable p/e.

hindsight is 20/20.  yeah, selling in december would have been a good play.  selling at the ath is a great investment strategy.  we're not at ath's right now.  all that matters is what we should do today.  

also, you seem to reducing the stock market to pe ratios.  as if that is some alpha-generating strategy itself.  low pe stocks have been vastly outperformed by high pe stocks over the last 15 years.  

&gt;your assumption that losing 3-5% risk free because of inflation is automatically worse than losing 50%+ by being in historically overvalued stocks is going to be tested when your portfolio gets cut in half.

the overvalued stocks have already lost over 50%.  pypl is down more than 60%.  fb is nearly down 50%.  tdoc, zm, dkng, hood... lots of these names are down 70%+ from ath's.  the situation you described has already happened.

you think these are going to lose another 50%?  i mean, it's possible, but these aren't vapor companies.  pypl is trading at its lowest pe ratio since at least 2016, that's as far back as i can check.  fb is at its lowest pe ratio ever (\~14).  

these are both companies that have grown revenue basically every quarter of their existence.  go ahead and buy your boomer stocks because they're low pe.  growth is what's on sale right now.  i'll take $fb at a 14 pe over $xom at 14 pe.

[interestingly i think chinas long game is happy to account for some stagnant growth. the b*tchslap to baba pointing out that they aren't interested in allowing companies to gain multi-sector monopolies that would cause governmental issues down the line (amzn).   i think china would be willing to allow portions of its barely above poverty line to slip back into poverty if it advances their global positioning. for example if the backing of russia's advance into ukraine results in sanctions on china i think they would be willing to take that for awhile as it will have knock on impacts on western societies, which imo will cave a lot sooner; like how china was willing to wait out trump's trade tariff war.   i think china would like to maintain some of its control on western countries through its manufacturing by potentially ensuring it doesn't grow too fast. just my 2 cents. sometimes the long game involves being at the bottom awhile longer.](/r/stocks/comments/t03o0u/with_russia_invading_ukraine_what_are_the_odds/hy8pbis/)

i realized last night that nato and eu were just going to sit by and do nothing (the sanctions are for show only).  tbh, that surprised me.  this is in their backyard, ukraine is a nato partner (though not treaty member yet), and the politicians had made all sorts of promises to stand by ukraine.

i had shared on this sub that i had the opposite view yesterday (i thought the west wouldn't stand by) and had sold my long $spy delta in anticipation of real economic disruption.  but it was to be business as usual instead.  as a trader, i accept the facts as they are, and trade them no matter how odious i find it.

[voo  rio  nio  bp  edit: i’d like to explain my choice as well.  voo is an easy pick and could also be easily replaced with spy (but i prefer voo for lower cost), with this one i am exposed to all relevant us companies.  rio is mining company with excellent dividend with headquarters in uk and australia, and operating in all continents (or most, not sure about this, but they are widely present). they are also undergoing expansion, especially in lithium mining and maintaining their iron ore production which is mainly being bought by china. need for ore in china is constantly growing and i don’t see this changing in the next 10 year period. rio would be my stock of choice if i could invest in only one company, mostly because of their long history, stability and high dividend yield.  nio is basically just a high risk chinese growth stock. but at a current price, they have much more upside potential. what i like the most about the company is their completely different approach to batteries in cars. i think their future will be focused on battery swap station (they own patents) more than ev. they are already leaders in battery swap business in china. recharging batteries in ev’s is just not a sustainable model, as even if we advance in fast charging i don’t think we could beat their swap time of 5 minutes. not sure how it works exactly or if it’s completely true but their page claims their vehicles have free lifetime warranty (quite confident about their product aren’t they?).   bp is one of the most relevant energy stocks in europe. it would be hard to choose between this and xom, but bp already showed it’s intention to move forward with their green energy program and they will be forced to focus more on that sector as europe is moving to that direction much faster than us. i think they will suffer in the process, but they are already one step ahead us energy companies. once their huge oil capital settles in green energy, they might become growth stock in the next 10 years. also they have decent dividend. russian conflict will also force them to focus more on alternative energy sources, but they have enough money to invest in it. only problem is their mental ceo, once he is gone, the stock will skyrocket.  i like to invest in stable companies that are looking into future the same way i do, and that’s electric. everything will be electric in the future no doubt. but we will need lot of materials and oil to do so. that’s why i choose bp and rio that are moving towards sustainability. i also like to take some gambles and i think nio is the best gamble.   all of those are my actual investments with rio and voo being the largest holdings. also have qqq,vxus,xli and sqm (sqm is my biggest winner so far, wish i’d put more money in it, but has some considerable risk to it)](/r/stocks/comments/t1hm76/you_can_only_own_four_stocks_in_your_retirement/hyg3mqm/)

[greed and fear drives the market.   the uncertainty about russians intentions and most importantly about the market's reaction took us down wildly. to try to profit from those movements in price, once they started, is at least for me a losing strategy, almost always has been.  now the greed part : prices are way down from ath, lots of stock were already pummeled before the war broke out. people woke up yesterday and realised russia and ukraine are tiny economies and their lives are and will be unaffected and they say to themselves: let's make a shit ton of money. greed.  i can't predict anything short term, but it's my view on the market action that we saw.  the world is so unstable right now, think what we went through lately, covid, inflation, huge bull run, now the fucking war. i like to think (and it's not my idea) that instability breed stability and vice versa](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t1epa0/im_fucking_done_with_this_shit_im_out/hyfxwjs/)
