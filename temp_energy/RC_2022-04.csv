exxon does not hedge, or lock in oil sales, and results generally match changes in energy prices. russia's invasion of ukraine pushed up oil by 45% last quarter over the final period of 2021, to an average of $114 per barrel, the highest in seven years.

&gt; - cpc normally delivers 1.2 mln bpd of oil
&gt; - novak says pipeline could be halted for up to two months
&gt; - delivery of spare parts has been halted - cpc's head
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; march 23 (reuters) - crude oil exports from kazakhstan's caspian pipeline consortium (cpc) terminal on russia's black sea coast stopped fully on wednesday after damage caused by a major storm and continued bad weather, a port ship agent and the head of cpc said.
&gt; 
&gt; the cpc pipeline has been in the spotlight since what russia calls a ""special military operation"" in ukraine, which has restricted russian exports and led to an oil price spike. the united states has imposed sanctions on russian oil, but said flows from kazakhstan through russia should run uninterrupted.
&gt; 
&gt; two of three loading facilities at the black sea port of novorossiisk were damaged by the storm and would take at least one and a half months to repair, the agent told reuters.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; cpc chief executive niklai gorban said the damage was ""critical"". he also said foreign suppliers have stopped deliveries of spare parts for the damaged facilities..
&gt; 
&gt; he didn't elaborate why, while the west has introduced sanctions against russia over ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; russian deputy prime minister alexander novak later said that oil supplies by the cpc may be completely stopped for up to two months.
&gt; 
&gt; ""technical experts are making checks... situation is quite difficult on the whole,"" novak said.
&gt; 
&gt; the cpc pipeline carries around 1.2 million barrels per day of kazakhstan's main crude grade, light sour cpc blend. the volume accounts for 1.2% of global demand. [read more](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-warns-sharp-caspian-pipeline-oil-export-drop-after-storm-2022-03-22/)
&gt; 
&gt; most of the oil in the pipeline belongs to russia, kazakhstan and international oil majors such as chevron [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n). any major disruption to its flows will put further strain on a global oil market facing one of the worst supply crunches since the arab oil embargo in the 1970s.
&gt; 
&gt; ""yesterday, after a spell of really strong northern wind the terminal inspected their facilities and found that spm (single point mooring) 3 required technical service and had to be taken off service. today it was decided that spm 2 requires the service as well and therefore would stay off operations,"" the ship agent said.
&gt; 
&gt; the third facility was still operational but bad weather on wednesday stopped these flows as well.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; caracas, april 7 (reuters) - the chair of the ad-hoc board of venezuela's state-owned oil company pdvsa (pdvsa.ul), which controls some of its most important foreign assets, said on thursday it was very likely that washington will extend chevron's [(cvx.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/cvx.n) license to operate in the south american country.
&gt; 
&gt; the united states has provided the u.s. oil company with a special operating license exempting it from sanctions on venezuela's vital oil sector for periods of up to six months, but only to maintain minimal operations and not including activities such as drilling and trading.
&gt; 
&gt; ""i think it is very likely that chevron and service companies will have their licenses extended,"" horacio medina, chair of the pdvsa ad-hoc board named by venezuela's opposition, said in a virtual event.
&gt; 
&gt; ##### register now for free unlimited access to reuters.com
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; an extension would not mean anything different to the terms chevron is currently operating under, medina said, although he added that the oil company seems to be asking for a two-year extension.
&gt; 
&gt; chevron did not immediately respond to request for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; a high-level meeting between u.s and venezuelan officials in caracas at the beginning of last month opened the possibility that sanctions imposed by the united states on pdvsa in 2019 could be relaxed amid a global need for fuel caused by russia's invasion of ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; the special operating license, which expires in june, also applies to oilfield service companies including halliburton [(hal.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/hal.n), schlumberger ltd [(slb.n)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/slb.n), baker hughes co and weatherford international.
&gt; 
&gt; chevron also hopes to operate the fields where it is based in venezuela and sell its crude, medina said, something that will require legal reforms and approval from the south american country's national assembly, which is controlled by the ruling party.
&gt; 
&gt; pdvsa and venezuela's ministry of information did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

even if you look at $schd, it is still above the 50 dma and outperforming the indexes.   why?  it is not overweight tech stocks.  it has coca-cola, and verizon, and pepsico, and blackrock, and cisco.  

this is a market rotation and not an all out market crash. it just might feel like a crash if you are not diversified.",2,,drew-gen-x,0

i don't think i'm very capable of determining what is fair value or not, but i look at companies relative to others. perhaps it is fairly valued, perhaps not. i suppose it depends on how long we will see current commodity prices. further below you see that i purchased fb and googl instead of xom, so i believe they are (long-term) currently valued worse than xom.",2,,Remah,0

1650805215,"typically when i give investing advice (or show people what i tend to do) i show them charts like $voo or $vti, and then i show them charts like $t or $xom. too many people fall into names they've ""heard"" people tell them to invest in because they get that dividend check and it's nice and plump but fail to see what happens to their money over time. this is the kind of advice so many people give out and it's a bit disheartening. i have a coworker that i helped her son. he inherited a lot of money from his passing father. so, i wrote up a few things on investing, showed him a few charts and historical returns and potential compounding interest calculators. 

talked about the diversification of $vti and $voo, what expense ratios are and that while it might be boring, you don't have to think about it or keep up with it as they are constantly auto restructured every so often. so, continually, constantly and consistently dollar cost average into it. you'll easily be a millionaire in 20+ yrs. 

then i said, to enjoy yourself and to get to know the market over time, utilizing around 10% of your total portfolio, invest in things you either know, like, or want to support. this way you don't feel like your missing out and it gives you a chance to learn by experience but not blowing up your account and lets you sleep easily and focus on life if your choices are unknowingly volatile.",8,,DaegenLok,0

1650911104,"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenpeace-blocks-tanker-delivering-russian-oil-norway-2022-04-25/

oslo, april 25 (reuters) - norwegian police said they had arrested 20 greenpeace and extinction rebellion campaigners who on monday blocked a tanker from delivering russian oil to an exxon mobil terminal.

in a protest against russia's invasion of ukraine, activists had fastened their red rubber dinghy to the ust luga's anchor chain, greenpeace said, as they sought to prevent it offloading an estimated 95,000 tonnes of oil.

""oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis, but also of wars and conflicts. i am shocked that norway operates as a free port for russian oil, which we know finances putin's warfare,"" greenpeace norway head frode pleym said.

the group called on the norwegian government to ban imports of russian fossil fuels and said that exxon mobil's (xom.n) norwegian esso unit should cancel any contracts for such imports from russia over its invasion of ukraine, which moscow describes as a ""special military operation"".

norwegian police later said all the activists had been removed from the area.

the hong kong registered ust luga is anchored outside esso's slagen oil terminal about 70 km (43 miles) south of the capital oslo, according to vessel tracker marine traffic.

esso norway had agreed to buy the oil before the conflict started and does not have plans for further purchases from russia, a company spokesperson told reuters.

""esso norway fully complies with all norwegian sanctions and we support the coordinated international efforts to end russia's unprovoked attack,"" esso said in an emailed statement.

1651106322,"looks like you probably bought erx and gush because oil was high? yeah, the trick is that you need to buy them *before* they go up in price, not after. it's awesome if you already hold oil/energy stocks, but it's probably a pretty bad time to buy them right now.

if it makes you feel better, even warren buffet has made that exact mistake with oil in 2008:

&gt;""last year i made a major mistake of commission (and maybe more; this one sticks out). without urging from charlie \[munger\] or anyone else, i bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. i in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. i still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40-$50 price. but so far i have been dead wrong. even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars.""
