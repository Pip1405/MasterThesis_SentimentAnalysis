I was looking at some stocks on the FinViz map and I noticed something so I decided to take a look for myself.

Do you see what I see? This makes me wonder if theres any stock in the market that isn't manipulated.

Also, why do they do this? Why would they want their charts to be almost identical. Is this proof that they are working together to keep their shit show up? I don't have much wrinkles so would appreciate if some wrinkle brains could elaborate on this matter.

1646163412,goldman sachs stock (gs) - potential bottom," 

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to point out a triple bottom I found along with unusual call activity in GS stock.

Check out the daily chart - there is support at $327. Three bounces this month, as well as additional bounces in Feb &amp; April of 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3s1tq85bvvk81.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4019011337a26be29a46fcd3f3071cd8f6444623

After, check the 1min chart on March 1 2022. Multiple bounces at $327. This shows there is decent support here.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, my bot which tracks unusual activity from high-net-worth traders is showing call activity for the $327.5 strike.

I'm predicting a rally to at least $340, but potentially much higher.

Let me know your thoughts and feel free to check out my other predictions on my profile.

1646251502,update on gs stock - options up 66% after signal,"Hey everyone,

GS bounced off support today. I discussed this as a possibility yesterday [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/wallstreet_vision/comments/t4g9kt/goldman_sachs_stock_gs_potential_bottom/). Feel free to check out the analysis.

The stock continued bouncing on the $327 level today at open before going up around 2.5%.  

https://preview.redd.it/c2nf2vgx01l81.png?width=1908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7225227a5402f5b3586c6b811b85d6866d88fa33

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the daily chart as a reminder. My original price target was $340. As we approach that, I'm keep tracking of market sentiment to see if this a real bottom, or if we are heading lower.

https://preview.redd.it/h6xix2f111l81.png?width=1873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e986533376d912fae918e2560003f8b88ea6c5a

IWM hit a double bottom at the $137 level. Other indexes made a new low while IWM only hit the previous low and bounced. So it will be interesting to continue watching here.

The soaring oil price and Western stock market selloffs mean Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s $500 billion Public Investment Fund has greater firepower and juicier targets.    The PIF has already bought minority stakes in gaming companies like Japan’s Nintendo (7974.T) and Embracer (EMBRACb.ST) in Sweden, while cash-rich Gulf companies such as UAE telco group e&amp; (ETISALAT.AD), formerly known as Etisalat, recently spent $4.4 billion on a 10% stake in Vodafone (VOD.L).

The  upshot is a bonanza for those with long-cemented relationships. JPMorgan, Goldman and Moelis (MC.N) have grabbed 50% of M&amp;A fees in the UAE and Saudi worth $198 million so far this year, according to Refinitiv. All worked on Aramco, and JPMorgan’s links to Saudi go back decades. Fellow Aramco advisers HSBC and Citi grabbed 24% of IPO fees, Refinitiv data shows. Citi, which blotted its copybook after 9/11 by withdrawing from Saudi, has cemented improved relations via a personal visit from Chief Executive Jane Fraser. Meanwhile, Riyadh is getting less austere.

HSBC has hired at least five bankers in Saudi Arabia in recent months and moved one of its Dubai-based managing directors to Riyadh, Bloomberg reported on June 9.

Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has been shortlisted to buy a stake in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia Starbucks franchise held by Alshaya Group.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, widely considered the best gauge of the health of the broad U.S. economy, rose a modest 0.9 percent since March 3. The S&amp;P 500 index also added 0.9 percent, while the Nasdaq composite picked up 1.3 percent. The Dow plunged 5.8 percent during the second week of March and has fallen 2.7 percent in 2018. That includes a small weekly drop of 0.4 percent Monday. The indexes' 1.3 percent gains since the start of 2018 are still below the 5.3 percent gain for the S&amp;P 500 during the same period.

1666188019,goldman sachs stock analysis (#gs),"Investment banking and asset management giant Goldman Sachs recently reported a big reorganization in their business, but what does that mean for potential investors?  Looking at the fundamentals, it's a mixed story.  

Although shareholders have been diluted a bit over the past few years and the company doesn't produce a huge amount of returns on invested capital, its income looks good and its dividend seems well covered.  Even with modest growth and valuation estimates, the stock looks like it is in buy territory based on today's prices.

1672237813,is bank of america stock a buy now!? | bank of america (bac) stock analysis!,"Bank of America is one the largest banks in the U.S. and has seen considerable stock declines this year, along with its competitors.  BofA is trading a bit more cheaply to its peers on a price-to-earnings basis, but it is still relatively in line with the industry, at around 10 times earnings.  

This makes sense because the return on assets, a measure of profitability, is a bit lower for BofA than for its competitors.  The company pays a solid dividend of over 2.7% and based on a few different valuation models, looks like it is somewhat undervalued at its current price point.
