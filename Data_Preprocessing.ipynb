    i think part of the criticism of capitalism is that a single ownership decision (buying/selling stock) has more impact on someone's net worth than 50 years' worth of brilliant contributions to the human race. witness steve jobs, who died with 1/20 the net worth of bill gates, despite having revolutionized or created the consumer personal computer market, fully automated, self-diagnosing factories (next), computer animation (pixar), mp3 players (the ipod), smartphones with touch screens (iphone), and pioneering the software subscription model. bill gates basically hacked out buggy, ugly imitations of steve jobs products (and according to an article i read, most of gates's net worth was in apple stock a few years ago!). \\n\\nthe difference? steve jobs sold his apple shares when he was ousted in favor of john sculley. bill gates kept his microsoft shares. \\*that\\* was the single biggest determiner of the net worth of each of them.   \n",

it from other people and other countries and hoards it in his/apple’s coffers. if that wealth were distributed equitably among apple’s workers (inclusive of the contracted manufacturers and retail workers) and the countries from which the resources necessary to fabricate apple’s products are procured, they would be much wealthier than they are and tim less so. the primary beneficiaries of the stock dividends you mentioned are the wealthy and large institutions/funds. retail investors and retirement accounts do not make up a substantial part of apple stock ownership.\\n\\nyour hunter-gatherer analogy falls flat on its face when compared with the gross inequality this economic system creates. a more apt analogy would be: someone discovers a huge food supply. they keep it to themselves, and pay the rest of the tribe one crumb to work and perpetuate the supply. upon finding out another has attempted to start his own farm in a nearby field, he bribes a couple warriors by giving them full meals to go burn it down so he remains the only source of food in town, thus cementing his economic and political power.\\n\\nwhere’s the reward? where’s the incentive? these rosy descriptions do not accurately portray the market economy which has ultimately led to countless wars, poverty, and our impending ecological collapse in the pursuit of profit.   \n",

and value..\\n\\nyou buy apple stock, then there is a company that actually gets better at what they do, and thus grows our economy.\\n\\nand yeh i think all hyper financialisation sucks including gambling your savings on the stockmarket .\\n\\nfuck in that sense i want that system to fail as much as the crypto crowd.\\n\\nbut it is a system with value that grows  iphones get better, lithium mines openened.  these things power our lives.\\n\\n\\ncrypto, not so much it is completely virtual , it takes and does not give.\\n\\nand as the spate of ape losses shows suddenly the advantages of centralisation pop up, law enforcement , rules , accountability.  \\n\\ni wouldn't trust a system ran and mined from third world dictatorships to be in your best interest.\\n\\nhave fun make some cash, but in the end if everybody went ahead and digged into it then your crypto would be meaningless. cuz who'd buy at inflated prices.?\\n\\nits a zero sum system, someone suffers for another to get ahead. and like every other such bubble market , when it pops it will have pushed a massive amount of real cash to a few operators leaving the average chum to pony up the bill.   \n",

`[ ... ]`!\\n\\ntake care, there are some subtle differences.\\n\\none of the biggest of these is that the right-hand side of the `==` and `!=` operators is treated as a _glob_, unless it is quoted.\\n\\nthat is:\\n\\n    [[ foo ==  f*  ]]; echo $?    # 0\\n    [[ foo == 'f*' ]]; echo $?    # 1\\n\\nsimilarly:\\n\\n    v='f*'\\n    [[ foo ==  $v  ]]; echo $?    # 0\\n    [[ foo == \"$v\" ]]; echo $?    # 1\\n\\nwith `[ ... ]`, the unquoted versions would perform filename expansion, which would certainly not be what you wanted!\\n\\nanother thing is that to keep in mind is that the and and or operators are `&amp;&amp;` and `||`, not `-a` or `-o`. but technically speaking, support for `-a` and `-o` inside `[ ... ]` is optional anyway, so portable scripts cannot rely on them. (this is related to the \"4 or more arguments\" thing i mentioned in my previous comment.)\\n\\napart from these few things, everything you might do in `[ ... ]` should work the same in `[[ ... ]]`. moreover, there are some things you can do in `[[ ... ]]` that cannot be done at all with `[ ... ]` &amp;mdash; regular expression matching, for instance.\\n\\ni also find it quite pleasing that `[[ ... ]]` mirrors bash's `(( ... ))` syntax for evaluating arithmetic expressions.\\n\\nand finally, as i said before, since `[[ ... ]]` is shell syntax its syntax can be checked _during parsing_. this is not possible with the `[ ... ]` command, which can only fail during execution.\\n\\n    $ [ = foo ]; echo survived\\n    bash: [: =: unary operator expected\\n    survived\\n\\n    $ [[ == foo ]]; echo survived\\n    bash: conditional binary operator expected\\n    bash: syntax error near `foo'\\n\\nin the second case, the execution of _the entire line_ was not performed since the syntax of the `[[ ... ]]` command was invalid. if you're writing bash scripts carefully, in such a way that the script's entire syntax is checked before any significant commands are executed, this can help prevent bugs.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      the one you started this post off was a somewhat subtle example of word splitting.\\n\\nword splitting applies to any expansion (something like `$some_var` or `$(some-command)` or `$((some expression))`) that is not double-quoted. when word splitting occurs the expansion is split upon whitespace (actually the characters in `ifs`, but let's assume you haven't changed that), and moreover if the expansion _only_ produces whitespace, or it is completely empty, no fields are produced at all.\\n\\nso let's look at an example:\\n\\n    $ v='a b c'\\n    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\\n' $v\\n    &lt;a&gt;\\n    &lt;b&gt;\\n    &lt;c&gt;\\n\\nhere `$v` is not double-quoted. its expansion is `a b c`, and this undergoes word splitting, yielding _three separate arguments_. this is why `printf` produces three separate lines.\\n\\nif `$v` is double-quoted, word splitting is suppressed:\\n\\n    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\\n' \"$v\"\\n    &lt;a b c&gt;\\n\\nas i said before, the command you opened this post off with had word splitting. when you ran:\\n\\n    [ -n $hello ]\\n\\nthe `$hello` was not double-quoted, so its expansion — just an empty string — underwent word splitting. word splitting turns an empty string into _no arguments at all_. you were actually running:\\n\\n    [ -n ]\\n\\nwhere the `-n` isn't even treated as an operator at all.\\n\\nnow let's do something slightly different:\\n\\n    $ v='/etc/host* /etc/*-release'\\n    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\\n' $v\\n    &lt;/etc/host.conf&gt;\\n    &lt;/etc/hostname&gt;\\n    &lt;/etc/hosts&gt;\\n    &lt;/etc/fedora-release&gt;\\n    &lt;/etc/os-release&gt;\\n    &lt;/etc/redhat-release&gt;\\n    &lt;/etc/system-release&gt;\\n\\nwhat's going on here is that `$v` is first expanded to `/etc/host* /etc/*-release`. this undergoes word splitting, so we then have two separate arguments, `/etc/host*` and `/etc/*-release`. both of these arguments contain glob characters, so filename expansion takes place on each of them. this produces seven separate arguments on my system, the filenames that happened to match those glob.\\n\\nagain, double-quoting `$v` can prevent filename expansion:\\n\\n    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\\n' \"$v\"\\n    &lt;/etc/host* /etc/*-release&gt;\\n\\nnow, i have deliberately avoided mentioning anything about `test` or `[ ... ]` here because i wanted to make it clear how word splitting and filename expansion worked on their own. let's see how they can do weird things with `[ ... ]`.\\n\\n    $ v='f != f'\\n    $ [ $v ]; echo $?\\n    1\\n\\nso what's happening here? the expansion `$v` is not inside double-quotes, so it undergoes word splitting. this yields `[ f != f ]`. there's no glob characters here, so no filename expansion occurs, and so `[ f != f ]` is the command that's executed. it's not surprising this fails.\\n\\nbut if we were to change this to:\\n\\n    $ [ \"$v\" ]; echo $?\\n    0\\n\\nnow word splitting is _not_ performed. we're back to the case when `[ ... ]` is given a single argument, and we know that just tests whether the argument is not empty. `f != f` is certainly not an empty string, so the command succeeds.\\n\\ni've given an example in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/s1yxnn/empty_variables_pass_both_n_and_z_in_if_statement/hsbkqi4/) of how filename expansion inside `[ ... ]` can end up doing the wrong thing.\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**edit**: i realise now there's another aspect to all of this that hasn't been made clear. we've been using the term \"expansion\" rather loosely.\\n\\ntake a look at [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/shell-expansions.html). this describes all the kinds of expansions performed by the shell on ordinary commands:\\n\\n* brace expansion\\n* tilde expansion\\n* parameter and variable expansion\\n* command substitution\\n* arithmetic expansion\\n* word splitting\\n* filename expansion \\n\\nthe order of these expansions is important. you'll note that word splitting is performed after most expansions... but it comes _before_ filename expansion! filename expansion actually takes place on the result of word splitting.\\n\\nnormal commands perform all of these expansions. `[ ... ]` is just an ordinary command, so it performs all of these expansions.\\n\\n`[[ ... ]]` however only does _some_ of these expansions. it does not do brace expansion, nor does it do word splitting or filename expansion.   \n",

think the crowd it gets hate from are mostly enthusiasts; it's clear that the console is a cheap trojan horse meant to drive game pass subscriptions to casual audiences like parents. but how do you sell a $300 device to the casual non-gamer audience when the switch exists? i expect to see more marketing for it going forward and not as much for the series x, honestly.\\n\\nlooking forward to $msft earnings in a week or so. they have not updated their game pass numbers in some time but interested to see how the holidays have changed things.   \n",

are good for sure, but also keep in mind subscribers aren’t shelling out as much money for games, which also cuts into microsoft’s income. it cuts into both hardware and software sales. \\n\\ninvestors love subscriptions because they’re trendy, sticky, predictable and tend to go up. but that does not mean they are universally more profitable. \\n\\nall i’m saying is that microsoft is a much larger company that xbox and if you’re looking for stock price movement, about 2/3 of the company’s revenue comes from b2b so any movement there is going to overshadow xbox. \\n\\ni’m not saying xbox isn’t important to the company and shareholders, just that watching $msft stock price movement in relation to gamepass subscriptions is a pretty lossy signal.   \n",

interesting thing about subscribers not spending as much money on games is that the cvp of xbox thinks the service does induce some increased spending. according to [forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2021/03/19/game-pass-massive-growth-is-bringing-developers-some-surprises/):\\n\\n&gt;  on average, according to bond, game pass subscribers **spend 20% more time playing games, play 30% more games, play 40% more genres and, crucially, spend about 20% more on gaming overall**. that could always change if game pass and other subscriptions become a bigger part of the industry overall, but bond stresses that there’s still a lot of room for overall growth, especially since xbox is tying its streaming services to game pass.\\n\\nhow that math and economics work out, i have no clue. there's no direct reference to software sales but i believe microsoft is banking on subscribers willing to open up their wallets to microtransactions and other in-game content without having to own the software (that brings up concerns regarding the variety of content created for the service but that's another topic). i don't do microtransactions myself so i'm a bit curious about how much that generates in the future.\\n\\n&gt; all i’m saying is that microsoft is a much larger company that xbox and if you’re looking for stock price movement, about 2/3 of the company’s revenue comes from b2b so any movement there is going to overshadow xbox.\\n\\n&gt; i’m not saying xbox isn’t important to the company and shareholders, just that watching $msft stock price movement in relation to gamepass subscriptions is a pretty lossy signal.\\n\\nmy bad, *now* i understand your position. i didn't mean to say \"invest in microsoft because of game pass\" or i'm anticipating a big stock move because of game pass numbers. my fault for not clarifying my position. i only wanted some updated game pass numbers from their earnings and other data/justifications for the existence of the series s (sales relative to the x, the series s: game pass attach rate, digital sales through game pass, etc.). \"how well is the series s working\" is what i'm curious about and i just think that its relationship to game pass (and vice versa) is something to keep an eye on. \\n\\noverall, i am optimistic about the prospects of game pass but unsure about series s - i just want to see the numbers!   \n",

for nearly 80 years so they will continue this i presume.\\n\\nthey aren't leaders for tv\\napple beat them to market for mp3 players and phones\\n\\nthey do have subscription revenue \\nplaystation has good market share \\n\\ni know nothing about sony pictures so maybe this is the appeal.\\n\\nxbox has halo and forza therefore i have an xbox. \\ni really wanted a ps5 for ff7 but that released on pc so i bought it there. \\n\\ni have started building microsoft stock and want more of it. if i lived in japan i'd probably have sony stock and a playstation 5   \n",

solution. you can definitely write a script that uses a docker list command and pipes it to the start command. this was easy, can also be copy/pasted for quick changes.   \n",

some examples of the rules that you have like the example with the text editor?\\n\\ni have a script that uses rofi to prompt me for the unlock password for an encrypted usb storage device that holds the key for my keepass:\\n\\n    bindsym $meta+k exec $home/.local/bin/padlock &lt;uuid of usb stick&gt;\\n\\nand lock it again before locking the screen when i hit meta+l\\n\\n    bindsym $meta+l exec $home/.local/bin/padlock &lt;uuid of usb stick&gt; lock; exec light-locker-command -l\\n\\nand if you want to open your launcher with just a single press of the meta key, you have to capture it with bind*code* instead:\\n\\n    bindcode 133 --release exec --no-startup-id \"rofi -no-lazy-grab -show drun -modi run,window,ssh,drun\"\\n\\nmy best one though is probably the shortcut to see the currently defined hotkeys:\\n\\n    bindsym $meta+f1 exec terminal=alacritty i3-sensible-terminal -e $home/.local/bin/i3-keybinds.sh &amp;\\n\\nthe i3-keybinds.sh script is (and this is probably a bit sloppy, but gets the job done for now)\\n\\n    #!/bin/bash\\n    /usr/bin/grep -e \"bindsym\" -e \"bindcode\" $home/.config/i3/config | /usr/bin/grep -v -e \"^#\" -e \"^ \" | /usr/bin/cut -d\" \" -f 2- | sed 's/\\$mod/meta/g' | less\\n\\n----\\n\\n&gt; some windows tiling and some windows floating?\\n\\nyup!\\n\\n&gt; how does i3 handle windows that are designed to be floating but are being tiled?\\n\\ndepends on the window. until/unless you've told that window to float, it will be stretched out across a workspace container, just like any other window. usually this just means a lot of empty space between elements. like a sentence of text, with two buttons way at the bottom of the screen. you can always tell a window to float on command with a hotkey (pretty sure meta+shift+space is the default)\\n\\nhere are some examples from my config of windows that i decided needed to be floating at all times. because i defined these in the config file, they never get tiled at all, and are floating immediately when opened.\\n\\nvirtual machine manager\\n\\n    for_window [title=\"virtual machine manager\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"virtual machine manager\"] border pixel 1\\n    for_window [title=\"virtual machine manager\"] resize set 600 950\\n\\nremmina main window\\n\\n    # remmina\\n    for_window [title=\"remmina remote desktop client\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"remmina remote desktop client\"] border pixel 3\\n    for_window [title=\"remmina remote desktop client\"] resize set 745 700\\n    for_window [title=\"remmina remote desktop client\"] move position center\\n\\nsteam\\n\\n    for_window [title=\"steam - news*\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"steam - news*\"] border normal 3\\n    for_window [title=\"steam - news*\"] resize set 635 840\\n    for_window [title=\"steam - news*\"] move position center\\n    \\n    for_window [title=\"steam - self updater\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"steam - self updater\"] move position 300 300\\n    \\n    for_window [title=\"steam guard - computer authorization required\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"steam guard - computer authorization required\"] move position 500 300\\n    \\n    for_window [title=\"move install folder\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"move install folder\"] move position center\\n    \\n    for_window [title=\"friends list\"] floating enable\\n    for_window [title=\"friends list\"] move position center\\n\\n\\n*edit: this probably seems like a lot, but those three are more than half of my \"window rule\" lines in my config file*\\n\\n----\\n\\nand i saved this one for last\\n\\n&gt; recommend for programs like a terminal emulator?\\n\\ni'm one of those weirdos that uses a dropdown terminal, specifically tilda. if i want to tile terminals, i'll use tmux, i don't need terminal windows tiled all over my desktop. instead, i prefer that all of my terminals be in a single tabbed window that is a single button-press away.   \n",

text editor (simply due to the fact i'm still learning)\\n\\nlearn vi (and regular expressions).\\n\\nyes, not as quick and easy to learn as, e.g. pico, but once fairly well learned, much faster and more efficient to use - an in the long-term, on \\*nix, one will generally spend much more time using editor, than learning it.  and you needn't learn all the goop that vim includes (it adds lots of non-posix goop, including even [annoying](https://www.mpaoli.net/~michael/linux/vim/vim_annoyances.txt) stuff ... but whatever, some folks like vim a lot).  see also:  \\n[https://www.mpaoli.net/\\~michael/unix/vi/](https://www.mpaoli.net/~michael/unix/vi/)  \\n[https://www.mpaoli.net/\\~michael/unix/regular\\_expressions/regular\\_expressions\\_by\\_michael\\_paoli.odp](https://www.mpaoli.net/~michael/unix/regular_expressions/regular_expressions_by_michael_paoli.odp)\\n\\nanyway, bre or ere, quite simple to do.  per your \"specification, looks like you've got columns 1-20 for names 21-40 for \"namephone\" - i'm presuming the phone number associated to the name in the first field in the same line.  so, all we need do is extract those and put some separator between them, e.g. if we want to separate with, let's say |, we could do something like:  \\nsed -ne 's/\\^\\\\(.\\\\{20\\\\}\\\\)\\\\(.\\\\{20\\\\|\\\\).\\*$/\\\\1|\\\\2/p'  \\nprovide the input as stdin or file argument (after the sed script), and the output goes to stdout, which one can redirect to some other file.  gnu sed also offers an \"edit in place\" capability with it's -i option - but read the relevant details in the documentation - as it doesn't literally edit the file in place, but actually replaces it - that can make a difference in some cases, and each method has it's advantages and disadvantages.  \\none could also use ed or ex (ex is same program as vi, just in ex mode).  \\neither of those could do quite similar, and with tiny bit of shell could do it as cli edit-in-place:  \\n1,$v/\\^.\\\\{40\\\\}/d  \\n1,$s/\\^\\\\(.\\\\{20\\\\}\\\\)\\\\(.\\\\{20\\\\|\\\\).\\*$/\\\\1|\\\\2/  \\nw  \\nq\\n\\nthat would work with either ed or ex (or vi or vim in ex mode), though in those later non-ed cases, we could make it a bit simpler and shorter, notably changing 1,$ to % and  \\nw  \\nq  \\nto simply:  \\nwq\\n\\nanyway, those edit bits - the first would delete lines that have less than 40 characters - our sed example does similar but omits them from the output by not matching for the s command, and with the -n option, then not outputting them since there wasn't a match - but if there was a match, substitution would've been done, and with the p option on the s command, output the result after the substitution.  and our s command between sed and the rest is quite similar.  just with sed we default to all lines, and ed/ex we specify all lines (otherwise they'd just default to the current line, whereas sed by default is handling all lines), and in the case of sed we have the p option used, as explained.  with ed/ex we just write the end results to our file then quit.\\n\\nanyway, you could change what character(s) you use to separate the fields.  if you wanted/needed to get snazzier, could also strip whitespace where present from the start and end of the fields - but then your fields would no longer be fixed width - but at least you'd still know their maximum possible width.\\n\\nand if we used ere rather than bre, that would slightly change our re syntax (notably when we'd include or leave out leading \\\\) - otherwise quite the same for this.\\n\\nand ... some have suggested awk ... could you do it with awk?  it would be much easier with awk if you had some field separator character - and especially if also the fields were of variable width - but that not being the case, probably much easier to do with sed/ed/ex/vi as one may wish/prefer.   \n",

the configuration system for php is an absolute nightmare, and knowing exactly how it works requires a serious amount of documentation memorization    \\n- php has a loooong history of terrible security, more so than literally any other language  \\n- the naming of standard functions seems completely arbitrary (`bin2hex` , `strtolower`, `str_replace` etc)  \\n- the standard library has _a lot_ of extremely surprising behavior, like for instance `date_parse` by _default_ will assume current time for values not specified. `json_decode` will return `null` on parse error even though `null` is also acceptable json    \\n- the truth-table looks like it was created by a [white-noise generator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php)  \\n- string conversions will not consistently produce text for display (true = \"1\", false = \"\") because whether they focus their \"features\" on amateurs or what's actually useful is completely arbitrary. they can't seem to make up their mind on whether string conversions should do the same in reverse or not  \\n- php still does not natively support unicode (if you by mistake save a file using utf-16 encoding, php will vomit out all of your source code)  \\n- modules in php are a nightmare, especially on windows. is it built-in? yes, no? well you better check  \\n- it's so difficult to get working correctly \"vanilla\" that most people use custom installers they find around. oh you're unaware? well, try installing a web site someone else has made and get it working the first time. almost literally impossible    \\n- php has a dizzying array of different ways of handling errors, which error handling mechanism you have to use depends on what functions you are calling. some return an error value, some set an error state, some have their own error handlers, and some throw exceptions    \\n- some language design decisions are made not because they make sense, but because they want the language to look different. why use `::` for namespaces when you can use `\\\\` while ignoring the fact that `\\` is an escape character making it a problematic choice for string interpolation (and windows paths i guess)  \\n- rasmus lerdorf argued in \"favor\" of memory leaks because it was just [so easy to restart the web server instead](https://medium.com/@wordcorpglobal/programming-doesnt-require-talent-or-even-passion-11422270e1e4)    \\n- some keywords are magic, like `(int)`, because `int` is not a keyword. so what's `(int)`? a special hardcoded syntax that has nothing to do with anything else  \\n- how and whether a function works is dependent on a lot of things, including my first point; configuration. it might also be compiled in such a way that certain function will simply just not do anything. you just have to know about it.   \\n- php used to have the strangest operator of all languages, the null cast operator. what does it do? it returns null. well, it supposedly _casts_ a value to null. the value itself is unchanged. `$v = (unset)$value` is the exact same thing as `$v = null` so what does it do really? absolutely bizarre   \\n- when looking at the documentation for php, __you have to read the comments as well__. there are tons of gotchas that are either poorly documented or not documented at all, and you need to read the comments to discover them\\n\\ni'd like to hear someone make some solid technical arguments in favor of actually using php over literally anything else, because i honestly don't think there are any.  (\"i like it\", or \"i'm productive in it\" isn't a good reason, you're an engineer not a dabbler in desserts. if you're unproductive in other things it's because you are inexperienced, not because there's something inherently \"productive\" about php)   \n",

point in the future made by someone else but whatever meta is making sounds like doa bullshit. if it will even exists as an actual working product. all we've seen is a couple of marketing videos like this one with obama, and shaq reading a script over the phone:\\n\\nhttps://www.econotimes.com/nba-unveils-new-metaverse-coach-1627526\\n\\ni'm sure everyone and their mother is going to sign up for this laughably pathetic crap. lol.\\n\\nthey're reaching. they certainly announced the metaverse but have no idea what to do with it and can't come up with reasons why people would use it.\\n\\njust look at meta stock. -30% or more since november. institutional investors can certainly see through the bullshit empty marketing for a product that doesn't exist.   \n",

personal app habits are all over the place. i currently am up to my ears in the apple ecosystem, but i work in a place that uses windows based machines, with some slight google aspirations. i'm personally someone that like to separate my work from my personal accounts, so i seem to have a noah's ark style app setup where i have two email apps, two messaging apps, two cloud storage apps, etc. and it's just getting overwhelming trying to keep up with everything separate the way it is.\\n\\ni'm aiming to combine these accounts into one smooth setup where everything \"works,\" but now i'm somewhat overwhelmed with indecision regarding using the stock apple suite of apps (mail, iwork, calendar, etc.) and other third party alternatives that often lock features behind some subscription paywall (fantastical vs. ical, carrot vs. weather, drafts vs. apple notes, overcast vs. podcasts etc.). i know that these apps may be overkill, but there are some people that really evangelize certain app alternatives as “the way” that it makes me pause for a bit. i don’t necessarily mind paying a subscription for an app or service that i’ll use that makes my life easier, but the baked-in apple apps are generally functional to say the least. i just worry about putting all of my eggs in one digital basket. \\n\\ni've also heard rumblings (or grumblings) that icloud is not as secure as it leads on - i've heard of people's files just disappearing, for example. so do a majority of you use onedrive? google one? dropbox? just looking for some suggestions.\\n\\nobviously, i think migrating to the apple stock apps is probably the way to go, but if you're someone that evangelizes one app over a stock one i'd be curious to hear your thoughts. i also intend on staying with apple forever unless they obviously do something horrible as a corporation, and the windows/google alternatives just don't seem as appealing to me since they're clunky and in some cases fairly obtuse. \\n\\ncurrent

pay for your gas and groceries? how about your taxes or your phone bill? two people can agree on the value of something, the problem is when that value fluctuates hundreds (or thousands) of dollars a day, nobody is going to want to spend any of said pseudocurrency on a loaf of bread or their netflix subscription. you’re trading pokémon cards that somehow do even less than actual pokémon cards.\\n\\n“what’s the point of your apple stock if not to sell to a greater fool?”\\n\\napple is a company that designs, produces, and sells products used by the consuming public. a share in apple is owning a very, very small piece of aforementioned profitable business. as innovation, then production, then sales progress, apple’s “owners” get to profit when they decide to sell to the next investor looking to fund and profit off of said productive growth. look up “compound interest” and “what’s the average rate of return for the s&amp;p500?”, then take a look at the s&amp;p’s historical data if you’d like a better understanding of the long-term effects of investing in entities that have what’s referred to as “intrinsic value” (which can be used to describe anything from blue text that all the teenagers like seeing when they text each other to superior proprietary software that helps design the world’s best fighter jets to a world-famous red-and-white cursive logo on the side of a soda bottle that consumers have been exposed to since they were babies).\\n\\noh-apple also pays investors cash dividends along the way as a reward for giving them the capital they need to create, market, and sell their next iphone and $800 tv stand.\\n\\ndoes bitcoin do any of the above? or is it-again-a currency that nobody *uses* as a currency, and instead just gets bought and “hodld” in the hopes some greater fool will purchase said useless token for a higher sum if the original purchaser just waits long enough? eventually, you’re going to run out of greater fools.   \n",

means something (hence my wwe comment). usually there’s a cringy vikings fan yelling about how the stock is just a (cool) piece of fundraising memorabilia, but it sounds like you actually believe the “ownership” line. \\n\\nyou don’t make decisions. you don’t sign checks. you don’t get to share in any profit. if you bought a share of apple stock and gaslit yourself into thinking you “owned apple” you could at least share in the profits. the packers board effectively owns the team, and they periodically fundraise with a “packers+” subscription.   \n",

bought a share of apple stock and gaslit yourself into thinking you ‘owned apple’”\\n\\ni’d recommend researching what a stock actually is and what it means to own stock in a company. outside of the scope of this conversation, it seems like you have some misconceptions regarding stocks. \\n\\nalso, i happen to be an owner of apple as well as green bay packers, inc., and a litany of other corporations too.\\n\\n2. “you don’t make decisions”\\n\\ni (and every packers shareholder) get to vote at the shareholders meeting. we vote on the packers board of directors. now, is my vote terribly consequential? no, and i don’t kid myself that it is. but it’s still cool to get a vote that no other teams’ fans get. \\n\\n3. “they fundraise with a packers+ subscription” \\n\\nyup. as opposed to the vikings getting $500m in public funds for us bank. if you’re minnesotan, you’re likely paying for your stadium too but you don’t even get to call yourself an owner.   \n",

 &gt;is it really better than being paid in a finite resource to begin with?\\n\\ngenerally yes.  money is universally fungible, you can use it to buy food or a car or a house or a new tv or a massage or a movie ticket.  there's a problem with barter economics (where people directly trade resources) called the coincidence of wants:  if i have apples and you have shoes, how can we trade if i don't want shoes or you don't want apples?  money solves this dilemma by being a universally desired resource.\\n\\n&gt;why would i ever sell my [finite resource] if i expect it to increase in value?\\n\\nbecause you want a different resource, either out of necessity (everyone needs to eat every day) or marginal utility (maybe you want to move away from ny, or maybe you think amazon will have better returns than apple, or maybe you want/need a new car so need to turn your stock back into money to transact).\\n\\n&gt;what if someone decides to pay their employees in stock?\\n\\nfirst, this happens all the time:  management positions are often compensated with stock options in addition to money.  the reason this is less common at labor positions is utility.  it costs time and money to convert stocks into cash, and if you're spending the majority of the money you make, it's generally preferable to get money directly rather than having to take steps to turn whatever you got instead into more fungible resources.\\n\\n&gt;should employers get to decide how they pay their employees?\\n\\na couple of things here.  employers often pay their employees in secondary benefits other than money or stocks.  medical and dental insurance are a common one, on-site amenities like a gym or a lounge exist.  sometimes you'll get something like a company car or phone, though usually only in jobs where those are necessary for the work.  pensions used to be a fairly common form of remuneration, now 401k contributions (which is analogous to stock) is more common.\\na key idea here though is employers can only pay with resources they have.  if you want to pay your employees in land or apple stock, you need to own those things in the first place.  additionally, if any of those things saw general adoption as payments, their price would inflate dramatically.  this is problematic, since prices should ideally reflect actual utility rather than speculative value, and while this is an extant problem with the existing system, having everyone adopt a specific limited resource as currency would make it worse.\\nfinally, i would be remiss if i didn't mention the problematic idea of a \"company town.\"  there have been instances in the past where certain companies had enough influence in a region to completely control the local economy, using a secondary currency known as company script.  this had severe consequences for their labor pool amounting to perpetual poverty, since the script they were being paid wasn't fungible outside of the company town, and the company controlled both the supply of money and the places to spend it.\\n\\n&gt;either you trade the [deflationary asset] for [goods and services] or you go hungry.\\n\\nthe vast majority of people are in a financial position where they need to spend almost everything they earn on survival (food and clothing and transportation and housing).  this \"lower class\" doesn't make enough surplus to save for large assets faster than those assets appreciate, especially if they need to save for something like a medical emergency or a car failure.  as such, they never get to benefit from the appreciating asset value.  even if they were paid in something that appreciates in value, they would need to sell it for necessities since you need to eat every day to not die and you can't eat stock.\\n\\ni'll stress again, i can barely cover the gist of it here.  it would take a book, if not several, to do the topic justice.  also economics is heavily political, with lots of disagreement about even fundamental parts of the system.   \n",

videos on your iphone 11, then make sure you also backup that as well. while rest of the apple stock apps will continue to sync between the two devices, even if your icloud data storage is full but unfortunately photos will begs you to buy icloud subscription so yes do backup before transferring or signing into an apple id on your iphone 6s.   \n",

you op.\\n\\nit's alarming the number of \"i.t.\" people that have no clue how scripting works, much less the initiative to take a look when things error off or \"don't work\". powershell knowledge should be mandatory in i.t. / cyber security.\\n\\ni started teaching myself powershell and scripting menial things, then my scripts started evolving and doing more. i then started writing scripts with the most limited network admins in mind to make it as fool proof as possible to help my team - then i realized they just never use them.. they would rather spend 45 minutes manually doing

             unless i'm mistaken, the foobar2000 documentation doesn't show any way to extract the cover art or information about the cover art as a \"field\" or \"title formatting string\", which is what those parenthesis-enclosed items like \"%artist%\" refer to.   and the retrieval of tag-embedded art via the id3 \"apic\" frame does not seem to work in my testing by using the foobar generic retrieval function \"$meta(apic)\" which is logical because i don't think that's intended to pull the raw id3 tag frame data.\\n\\nhttps://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=foobar2000:title_formatting_reference#track_info_fields_and_functions\\n\\nbut clearly at the plugin level there is some way for developers to access the cover art, whether it be on the filesystem or embedded via tags, because there are plugins that do stuff with the album art.  so you may be able to accomplish what you want via an existing plugin (such as one of the scrobbling plugins for last.fm) or one of the plugins that allow custom jsscripting.  but i don't see any way to do it with the custom copy command type of approach you are using now to get the artist/track/album info. \\n\\ni know there are folks more familiar with this scrobbling/now playing type functionality than me so i'll defer and see if anyone else can point you in the right direction. sorry i'm not much help   \n",

better than the stock ios app? in my opinion and in my use, no. \\n\\nsame with notes versus bear or drafts or evernote or whatever. i know there are ways that the stock apps could be better, but how much better? the apple apps are pretty robust considering they’re “pack ins”. \\n\\ni think subscription models jumped the shark when deliveries went to a sub model. a delivery tracking app. with a monthly subscription. what the hell?\\n\\ni am at the point now where even if an app has better functionality than the apple stock apps, i’ll do my best to use the free icloud apps than any

courage! 💜💜💜\\nin 4 days, it will be 4 years since my aunt-mother died. aunt-mother = biological aunt, mother by adoption. \\ni was in a brutally abusive home. my bio mother tried to kill me any chance she got. i was kicked, stabbed, punched, scratched, burned, left unconscious to die, and shot. and that’s just a short description. i was in hell on earth. i would lay on the floor, unable to move, and waited to die. i cried but no sound came out and no tears flowed. i couldn’t tell for help. \\nmy auntie literally saved my life. i’ve had chronic pain since age 6 because of it and i have no pain free days. \\nmy aunt-mother did everything for me. i can’t even try to explain how much. i can say that because of her, i was able to study music and i started singing in churches for money since age 7. the money was placed in a trust fund. i got into every college i applied to. i went to college, got a degree in administration of justice and worked in that field. i saved every extra penny i had and lived modestly. \\n\\nat 29, i met and married a man who was 18 years older. no daddy issues. my dad legit passed away the day before my 4th birthday. we decided before getting married to live debt-free except for our mortgage and we would pay it off. we invested wisely. in 2000/2001, we both bought a lot of apple stock and let it sit. today, just that stock is worth $millions$. plus my retirement fund, his and our other retirement accounts that include that stock. \\n\\nat 40, i went and got another degree and became a nurse. i have worked in pain for my whole life. i’m in the process of retiring right now at 53 because pain management is a full time job. \\n\\nhubby retired at 67 and we moved to florida because the weather would help with pain management. that was 4 years ago and was in the same month my aunt-mother died. she insisted that i was not going to sit and watch her die. she was ready. \\n\\nbecause of her, i learned about money. i learned how to find a good man who would never hurt or abuse me. i am fortunate to not have any mental health issues. sadly, my brother does. i got the physical pain, he got the mental health pain. sometimes i think he got worse than i did. as a nurse, i know for sure that the body in general is easier to manage than it is to manage the brain…the mind. he does it tho and he’s stable and well. my aunt-mother saved two lives. and then she made us her children. \\n\\nhe’s a master hair stylist and does well. i’m retiring at 53 with millions of dollars. i’m gonna need it for my health care. but i would not have that without her bringing me up in the world. she was there for every concert, recital, graduation, awards ceremony, musical, parent-teacher conference, and every sport i played…all in pain. \\n\\nwill i mourn her loss on april 22nd? yes. will i be taking the day off from my soon to be last nursing job? no. believe it or not, i would have to ask someone to switch shifts with me. i’m not going to do that. like you said, a loss in my world wouldn’t factor into theirs. i’m in charge of how i grieve and when i grieve. my aunt-mother was devoted to our care. everyone who knew her, loved her. she had no enemies on this earth. she gave up any opportunity to get married in order to raise me. she said that god put her here to raise me. she really did believe that was true. \\n\\ni’m truly sorry for the loss of your child. there’s no name for a parent who loses a child. there are widows and widowers if one loses a spouse. but a parent who loses a child is still called a parent.  blessings to you.

 but i’ll explain why i disagree\\n\\nanother strawman.  i didn't ask what you disagreed about.  i asked what was in any way factually incorrect.  you can't find anything technically at fault. you merely \"disagree.\"\\n\\n&gt;explain how something like usdc or tether is a ponzi, when it doesn’t grow in value and isn’t used an an investment\\n\\nstrawman #2.  i never said usdc or tether are ponzis.  these are a different type of fraud. those are merely unsecured stablecoins that have not been [properly audited](https://i.imgur.com/buhqfqw.jpg).\\n\\ni said \"crypto as an investment is a ponzi\".  stablecoins are not supposed to be investments.  they're just proxies for fiat, although they're a scam in a different way because there's no proof their claims of being 1:1 fiat backed are true.\\n\\n&gt;every operator of a ponzi scheme stamped their face to it, told the investors there was something they would do to give them a return, (eg, sell the stamps,) and then paid them off with the investment of later folk. \\n\\nit's not a requirement that a ponzi have a single, central operator.  crypto proves you don't need a central operator to create a ponzi.  plus there are [plenty of ponzis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ponzi_schemes) that were de-centralized in various ways, especially involving satellite agents. \\n\\nthere's ample evidence in my original article that there's lots of deception and false promises made in the industry.  the whole \"to the moon\" and \"\\#wagmi\" memes are examples of deception and false promises.  \\n\\n&gt;secondly, how are investors compensated with the profits of new investors? because the more people that buy in=the more it grows? i know you hate this line of reasoning and call it a fallacy, but dude, our whole financial world is a ponzi scheme according to you. \\n\\ncrypto creates no value.  the *only* way you profit in crypto is by taking money from greater fools who buy in later.  that's the *only* source of income.  \\n\\nother things are not ponzis.  the stock market is not a ponzi scheme.  stocks represent shares in real world companies that can create value via products and services.  it's painful that this even needs to be explained to somebody out of elementary school.\\n\\n&gt;they key part, paying off investors, is just what isn’t here. no old bitcoin investors receive a check when someone new buys in, it’s just not how it works. \\n\\nyes it is how it works.\\n\\nwhen someone new comes in, they pay off/cash out someone earlier in the scheme.  crypto has no use or utility other than as a speculative token an early buyer hopes to sell to a later buyer.  the only value attributed is through marketing and peer pressure.  \\n\\nif i own shares of apple, they create products. whether you think apple stock has value is meaningless.  they create value and as a shareholder, i'm entitled to a fractional representation of their business.  crypto has no such attributes.  it's nothing like traditional investments.  it's not actually an investment at all.  it's a speculative commodity - and yes people can treat stocks like speculative commodities as well, just like i can make a bet on when a traffic light will turn red - that doesn't mean traffic lights are gambling devices.  they were designed and used for specific purposes.  crypto has no such design other than as a speculative token.\\n\\n&gt;like i said, if i start asking people to invest in the yen because i think it’s a solid investment, am i now running a ponzi?\\n\\nwow.. you can't seem to understand the difference between an investment and a currency. those are two different concepts.  eth and bitcoin are no longer currencies - they failed at that a long time ago, and have been re-branded as an investment.  currencies need to be stable to be useful and not fluctuate rapidly in value.  crypto is too volatile to be a currency.  which is why it's not being sold as an investment.  it's crappy at both.  for more info see: https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoreality/comments/pyn7c9/why_crypto_is_a_worse_more_volatile_and_more/   \n",

i also hate china stocks. i just needed a good leap candidate and, given their discussion of opening monetary policy to prop their market...it felt safe(r).\\n\\ni certainly feel better about china stocks that have been beat down to nothing than tech that is still heavily overextended...it would either be $yinn or $msft, and $yinn is cheaper   \n",

already knew that,\" you probably have it down.\\n\\nas for budgeting, the most basic of basics is something like this: \"i spend $x for monthly bills that are required and don't change much (rent, utilities, car note. even if they vary, set aside enough for when they're at their most expensive, like electricity during the summer), $y for bills that are optional luxuries (game subscriptions, netflix if you have your own, etc), and taken from my paycheck of $z, it gives me $m. can i afford food? if i plan meals, and give myself a budget for eating out (if it's affordable), that gives me $f for food, then the leftovers...out of that, l can then afford to put $v in savings, and have $l as fun money left over.\\n\\nseparating the monthly bills into necessities and luxuries also helps because in a pinch, you can cancel a luxury for a bit. if i'm in dire need of food, i'm not going to worry much about my xbox ultimate, i'll cancel that real fast.\\n\\noh! and set aside money for gas if you drive, or for transportation of some kind. unless you bike, then kudos!\\n\\ni'm 30 and had to learn all this the hard way, so i hope it helps at least a bit!   \n",

                            you might want to start with giving an exemple that is correct. the fish syntax doesn't have the `do`.\\n\\nthere are a few reasons why someone would want to use fish (especially as a interactive shell). \\n\\nfor starter the syntax makes more sense and is less cluttered. with the syntax highlighting and auto-indention, it's easy to remember the syntax.\\n\\non top of that, variables with fish are arrays. you don't have to worry about setting the `ifs` (what a cluster fuck that thing is by the way). you can have the shell make combinations by simply writing `$v1$v2`. when typing `$v` each element of the list is an argument. you don't have to worry about spaces or whatever nonsense.\\n\\nif you really want to use it for scripting, it's also much nicer than bash. completions would be an exemple where fish shines and it's one of the reason is that these usually run faster than bash and zsh thanks to its built-ins.   \n",

some reason 60% of apple shareholders suddenly sold tomorrow, the company would still have its iphone and ipad and mac sales, factories, contracts, subscription users, etc. all the revenue and all the cash.  the stock price is also more closely related to an actual real-world valuation based on sales figures, assets, expected revenue, etc.\\n\\nbitcoin is just, bitcoin, no actual value other than what the going rate for it is.  at least people who got burned on beanie babies still have physical beanie babies.  if bitcoin crashed to the bottom or disappeared, nobody would have anything, except maybe those people who got those physical bitcoins out of those bitcoin atm's, which maybe one day will be worth something as a collector's item...   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                yes, you can, but of course it would be a heck of a lot of manual tagging. if you want to stick to \"standards\" (a very loose term), i suppose the tags to use would be performer and instrument. (both as multi-value and in the same order). see [tag mapping](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=tag_mapping) for suggested \"standard\" field names. or sure you could use custom tags if you like as well.\\n\\nexample tags -\\n\\nartist: `the beatles`\\n\\nperformer: `john lennon; paul mccartney; george harrison; ringo starr`\\n\\ninstrument: `lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica; lead vocals, bass guitar; background vocals, electric guitar; drums, tambourine`\\n\\n(note multiple values are separated by semi-colon)\\n\\nin foobar [title formatting](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=foobar2000:title_formatting_reference#track_info_fields_and_functions), you can then combine the two fields for display purposes (for example in a [text display](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_textdisplay) / item details panel) -\\n\\n`$meta(performer,0) '('$meta(instrument,0)')'`\\n\\n= john lennon (lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica)\\n\\n`$meta(performer,1) '('$meta(instrument,1)')'`\\n\\n= paul mccartney (lead vocals, bass guitar)\\n\\n(etc)\\n\\nthe advantage of a separate field for instrument is that you can leave it out and group the other two fields as individual values. in a library viewer like [facets](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_facets) or [library tree](https://github.com/wil-b/library-tree) (script), they have a feature to list \"[multiple patterns](https://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=foobar2000:components/facets_(foo_facets)#multiple_patterns)\" so the column can combine multiple fields together in one list.\\n\\nexample view pattern -\\n\\n`%&lt;artist&gt;%|%&lt;performer&gt;%`\\n\\nand so, when you click on 'john lennon', you would get his (solo) artist credits as well as performer credits, in this case 'the beatles'. similarly you can add additional custom fields to get the complete works of a single artist. i also tag featured artists for example all into one column -\\n\\n`%&lt;artist&gt;%|%&lt;performer&gt;%|%&lt;featured&gt;%`\\n\\nnow if you also wanted the instrument field to have its own column of individual multi- values (so you could click on just 'harmonica'), that would be a bit more difficult. it would probably take some advanced title formatting or a different way of tagging than the above. (unless you just tag one instrument per performer per track)\\n\\nanyway, just some ideas there and one way of going about it...\\n\\ncheers   \n",

by a number (rather than a string key), you can use...\\n\\n    foreach ($x as $i=&gt;$v) { ... }\\n    \\n\\nwhich gives you each entry as $v and the index (0,1,2...) as $i, and then you can use iseven() and isodd() on it to determine if it's in the left or right column. it you can use modulus (% operator) to group into other numbers of columns.   \n",

metaverse ambitions**\\n  \\n**msft stock was flat on news hololens creator is leaving microsoft after accusations of misconduct.**\\n\\n[https://investorplace.com/2022/06/hololens-creators-departure-wont-derail-microsofts-metaverse-ambitions/](https://investorplace.com/2022/06/hololens-creators-departure-wont-derail-microsofts-metaverse-ambitions/)\\n\\non jun. 8, microsoft corporation (msft) confirmed hololens creator alex kipman is leaving the company after being accused of inappropriate behavior.\\n  \\nthis is a critical time, with the hololens ar headset the subject of a $22 billion army deal and a potential metaverse anchor.\\n\\n**microsoft corporation (nasdaq:msft) had a head start on the metaverse, the next big thing that could prove to be a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in less than a decade**. the company revealed its hololens ar headset back in 2016. in 2019, the company launched a second generation hololens 2, aimed at the commercial market. in 2021, microsoft landed a nearly-$22 billion contract to supply hololens 2 headsets to the u.s. army. however, msft has stayed fairly flat on both pieces of news.\\n  \\n\\n  \\n**as you might expect, a deal of that size was a win for msft stock. even more so because it involved futuristic technology instead of a bunch of office or windows subscriptions. this showed the future of microsoft and confirmed the company as a big player in the metaverse — even if the metaverse term hadn’t really entered business vocabulary at that point**.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nthat makes wednesday’s news disconcerting. alex kipman, a 20-plus year microsoft employee and creator of the hololens, is leaving the company. kipman has been accused of inappropriate behavior, including misconduct against female employees. according to cnbc, microsoft has indicated it will reorganize the mixed reality team and is weighing whether to continue hololens development.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nfor some investors, this may be a concerning moment, an apparent obstacle in microsoft’s metaverse ambitions. it may be embarrassing, but it is not the problem some think it is. with msft stock down almost 19% in 2022, this is a good time to buy it on the cheap. growth will return and keep going, with the metaverse playing a big role, despite the current hololens creator drama.\\n\\n**hololens will keep on rolling if microsoft wants it to**\\n\\n\\n  \\nalex kipman may be the creator of the hololens, but his departure does not mean it grinds to a halt. this is a team that was estimated at 1,500 people earlier this year. the engineering talent is there to keep product development rolling. if microsoft even wants to, that is.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nthe company previously cancelled the third generation hololens. the army contract is reportedly in trouble. at this point, microsoft may decide it’s better to leave ar headsets — and the cost of developing them — to third party vendors. \\n  \\n\\n  \\nmicrosoft has bigger metaverse ambitions than hololens\\n\\n\\n  \\nhololens was an early part of microsoft’s metaverse ambitions. however, it was also a small piece in the grand scheme of things. the company has much larger plans in motion to capture those trillions of dollars in expected metaverse spending.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nthis includes its azure cloud service — the metaverse lives on servers — xbox gaming, and its acquisition of activision blizzard (nasdaq:atvi).   \n",

acknowledged that private entities may qualify as state actors in limited circumstances, including when the private entity performs a traditional, exclusive public function, the court concluded that exception doesn’t apply in this case\"\\n\\n“[a] private entity may qualify as a state actor when it exercises ‘powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state.’ it is not enough that the federal, state, or local government exercised the function in the past, or still does. and it is not enough that the function serves the public good or the public interest in some way.”\\n\\naccording to the court, operating public access channels has not been “traditionally and exclusively” performed by government. “since the 1970s, when public access channels became a regular feature on cable systems, a variety of private and public actors have operated public access channels, including: private cable operators; private nonprofit organizations; municipalities; and other public and private community organizations such as churches, schools, and libraries.”\\n\\nthis is mainly focused on first amendment but it does give examples of private entities operating public spaces.

                          not true, interestingly. i actually wrote a script for a blog post exploring this topic which i still haven't got round to writing an publishing yet, but the fastest way in php to calculate the nth term of the fibonacci sequence is a straight up iterative loop of adding numbers. my script tested the performance of iteration, recursion, tail recursion and the golden ratio formula, both using regular ints up to the limit of php\\_int\\_max and using bcmath for larger values.\\n\\nfor example, to calculate the nth term using the formula via bcmath, the code looks something like this:\\n\\n        $magic = bcsqrt(\"5\");\\n    $a = bcpow(bcdiv(bcadd(\"1\", $magic), \"2\"), (string)$n);\\n    $b = bcpow(bcdiv(bcsub(\"1\", $magic), \"2\"), (string)$n);\\n    $c = bcdiv(\"1\", $magic);\\n    $v = bcsub(bcmul($c, $a), bcmul($c, $b));\\n    return bcadd($v, \"0.5\", 0);\\n\\nthere's actually quite a lot of work going on there. but the iterative approach\\n\\n        if ($n &lt;= 2) {\\n        return 1;\\n    }\\n    $a = $b = 1;\\n    for ($i=2; $i &lt; $n; $i++) {\\n        list($a, $b) = [$b, bcadd((string)$a,  (string)$b)];\\n    }\\n    return bcadd($b, \"0.5\", 0);\\n\\nalthough that for loop may be running hundreds of times, it's much more simple. it's *fast*, because it's just adding numbers together. and your computer is *really* good at adding numbers, it can do it a lot faster than it can calculate square roots or even multiplication, because adding numbers is something your computer is highly optimized to do *at the hardware level.*

[bbc link to article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-38691882)\\n* due to documented cases of malicious activities, the business is required to defend their actions in court. \"we warned them\" is not a defense that has succeeded in court in terms of child endangerment.\\n* in court, when the topic of 'knowledge' comes up - as opposed to legal suits of similar surrounding gta online, and battlefield/call of duty, microsft has extremely higher guidelines to meet as they market the game to minors. (vs, with the aforementioned examples, minors claiming suit are dismissed due to their falsifying of information to gain access to age restricted material).\\n* this ideology has been made public in recent cases of restriction of action, and scrutiny of inaction in cases on multiple social media platforms (ex. \"x group is now to recruit using z platform. z platform is now issued summons to explain their fostering of x group\")\\n* optional oversight, due to these unfortunate (yes rare) cases, is not possible for the legal reason of, \"microsoft knew the issue of predidation existed in their game, and cut off children's access to aid. instead allowing the owner of a illicit group to determine what was/wasn't appropriate.\"\\n* *financially - there is an incentive of global bans is to increase sales numbers, and quarterly profits.* this is well documented and practiced in the digital industry as *a subsidiary source of income for non-subscription based* customers. (i.e. the theme park model. we charge at the gate, but everyone is forced home. they have to pay to return.)\\n* developmentally - there is an incentive to remove older users/accounts. when banning users, the older members are more likely to be removed than newer accounts due to volume of previous interactions. legacy users carry with them expectations that hamper progress (here being known in terms of 'opposition to change in financial systems' examples such as subscriptions, micro-transactions, paid skins, paid maps, latency reduction, priority, etc.)  in short - consistent users who don't buy, are less useful to microsoft than new users who buy and accept. because new users, accept the game as it is, not as 'it should be'.\\n* it matters not what our customers want, it only matters what the court will decide.\\n* \"a customer who doesn't pay, doesn't have a voice.\" \"a customer doesn't make a sound till the exchange funds.\"\\n\\nsadly - these are the main driving points of issues like these. for pr - this is always pushed as \"protection of minors\" - such as to appeal to groups like parentstogether. and with that, they're able to push these oversight onto users without legal restriction because, as shown above, 'warning players' doesn't absolve microsoft from legal repercussions. and again, there's clear financial incentive to new sales through banned users.\\n\\nthis is the by-product of a multi-billion dollar game, with millions of daily users. we are the few, were are the silent (because we don't keep paying microsoft), and when we're gone, by choice or force, there are tens of thousands willing and able to replace us. and best of all for microsoft, those replacements will keep paying.\\n\\np.s. \"but our community is what makes the game.\" *made* the game. minecraft is self sufficient now. want proof? \"embrace\" - they took suggestions form reddit and mods. \"extend\" they encouraged sharing ideas and gave a new platform for new suggestions on their own site, \"extinguish\" now microsoft only acknowledges suggestions, through their official suggestion box, and only after suggestions have passed their moderation.\\n\\nsad but true. you and i, and the minority market share of java players - don't made enough impact to change the course of the game. case and point, even if hermitcraft stopped playing, bedrock sales alone would perpetuate...as they have been in this decade old game.\\n\\nedit: spelling   \n",

\"sentient ai\" google has? basically they took the text of all his testimonies and interviews and trained a natural language model in  openai’s gpt-3 ($msft)\\n\\nthe transcript is pretty entertaining:\\n\\n&gt;interviewer: you’re giving a major speech on friday [august 27, 2021]; what topics will you be covering?\\n\\n&gt;mr. powell: so today the world economy is strong. we have just seen an acceleration in growth. some countries are performing particularly well. it’s really a worldwide expansion that is having, in our view, a continued broad-based, moderate expansion. i will be talking about that in the context of the theme of jackson hole, which is the importance of moving in a more thoughtful and gradual way toward a more neutral monetary policy.\\n\\n&gt;interviewer: does climate change factor into your monetary policy?\\n\\n&gt;mr. powell: sure, we monitor it closely. this is a data-driven institution, so we consider all relevant information. if the data indicate a significant risk to financial stability that requires a more assertive policy response, the federal reserve will act as appropriate.\\n\\n&gt;interviewer: what do you think of electric cars?\\n\\n&gt;mr. powell: i’m a big fan of electric cars. i think we have to keep finding ways to reduce emissions, to get better mileage in our cars. i’m a big fan of electric cars.\\n\\n&gt;interviewer: do you think you’ve done a good job?\\n\\n&gt;mr. powell: yes, i do. i’ve had an excellent team at the fed. i think we’ve had a lot of successes at the fed. i think we’ve provided a very stable economic and financial system. i believe we’ve done a good job.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1tktmhcfdyqsk/an-interview-with-a-hyper-realistic-ai-powered-simulation-of-jerome-powell   \n",

also use grep:\\n\\n`return @bt.kv.grep(-&gt; $i,$l { $l.file ~~ /^^setting/ &amp;&amp; $l.file !~~ /backtrace/ }).map(-&gt; [$i,$v] { ~@bt[$i+2].line, @bt[$i+2].file}).slip`\\n\\nedit: you need to use the destructuring form (`[$i,$v]`) with `map` because `grep` passes on a `positional`. i’ve also used `~` to stringify instead of the `.str` coercer. you might also prefer to use the feed operator (`==&gt;`)  to make this “one-liner” style code a bit clearer.\\n\\nedit 2: you will also likely want to include a `.slip` to return a “single layer” list.   \n",

                                              microsoft has a massive moat in the enterprise software world. 90% of the pc market share is still windows. this allows their cloud service to complement the office products very well. \\n\\nthe reason i like buying msft over amazon is that both aws and azure make a comparable profit off of aws and azure ($20-30b+), meanwhile amazon has to spend more on their retail business, compared to microsoft that is generating recurring revenue from office 365 subscriptions. \\n\\namazon could outperform msft stock-wise but that is going to have to come from amazon’s other businesses blowing up so much in revenue since they’re low margin. businesses like prime video with tv deals, and international retail are two catalysts i see.\\n\\nanyway microsoft has a great ceo, great credit rating (aaa), great revenue, net income, and dividend growth + share repurchasing that is reasonable for its $2t market cap   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      first of all, if this feature will make it and in a proper way, that would be fantastic for the reasons mentioned earlier (so mainly separating unique and complex enough indicators useable in different scenarios, and composing their insights flexibly and reusable in any main indicator or strategy).\\n\\nbut it wouldn’t (or at least it shouldn’t) help with the security call limits as it is not the idea to misuse it as a workaround due to technical restrictions to only sneak in data by an otherwise useless „auxiliary indicator“ into an actual indicator. it’s like with any service architecture, where each service should offer one specific finite service, that actually solves one problem (not more, but also no less) and bigger more complex services should be composed by orchestrating these simpler reusable services.\\n\\nso for a made-up example from some things i mentioned earlier:\\n\\na basic indicator (indicator 1) showing the open interest for a ticker has some use in itself. this may not be enough for a complex strategy based on multiple pieces of information, but it definitely gives at least this one usable piece of information, that can be used in all kinds of scenarios.\\n\\nanother basic indicator (indicator 2) showing the percentile within a certain period of time for each value from a randomly given input, also serves a purpose in itself. it shows, within which percentile apple is from its highest value in the last 5 years, if the given input is the apple stock and the selected period of time is 5 years, or it shows within which percentile the spread of the 50d ma and the 200d ma of the chart symbol is, if the given input is an indicator, that is calculating exactly this spread, etc. anyway, the indicator serves this one purpose on its own.\\n\\na third indicator (indicator 3) plots the seasonality of any given input, and therefore also serves a purpose on its own.\\n\\nso, if i want to create an indicator or a strategy on a higher level, that combines several more basic indicators and in this example maybe gives a signal when the open interest of some ticker is within its 90% percentile and the seasonality is favorable as well, it, of course, needs to combine these pieces of information. in this example, i would therefore add indicator 1 to the chart to receive the open interest, and then apply indicator 2 on the output of indicator 1 to get the percentile of this open interest (and just by the way as another example, maybe i decide later, that it makes more sense to get the 90% percentile of some moving average of the open interest instead of the direct current open interest, in this case, i would just layer another indicator-on-indicator in between and apply a ma to the open-interest indicator and only then apply the percentile-indicator to the output of the ma), and then add indicator 3 to the chart to also receive the seasonality, and then i would add my orchestrating main indicator, that includes a set of rules based on any given percentile of an open interest and any given seasonality, where i would correspondingly deliver the outputs of indicator 2 and indicator 3 as inputs into this main indicator, to apply its calculations to them. this is the way, it’s meant to be and how it should be used.\\n\\nbut i don’t think, it’s a good long-term solution to regularly misuse this feature as a workaround to just sneak in data to support the creation of an actual useful basic indicator. let’s say, i would create such an indicator z, that relies on additional inputs from indicator x and indicator y (or that same indicator z with different settings to create the other part of the needed data as an input) as a crutch. how do you want me to communicate that to your end-users on the platform? „here is indicator z, to use it, please first add auxiliary indicators x and y (or a second time indicator z, but with a certain input configuration) with no purpose on their own to the chart and select them as inputs in indicator z, not because it makes sense to you (like in the example above, where the purpose of the composing indicator is to combine flexibly any percentile and any seasonality and therefore it will be logical to anyone, that you have to give him a specific percentile and a specific seasonality first), but just because otherwise it won’t work for technical reasons?“ i don’t think, this is a good long-term approach and just because this workaround is feasible, you shouldn’t consider any issue about limited security requests as being closed just because of this workaround.\\n\\nand a higher number of plots is of course used for visualization as currently only one plot could be transferred into another script anyway (unless applying indicator-on-indicator-on-indicator-on-indicator-on… , which i wouldn’t do). for the reasons mentioned above, it would also be recommendable not having to use it only to sneak data into another script as a workaround for a long-term solution.   \n",

because you work for apple or can’t take your head out of tim cook’s ass.\\n\\ni refuse to believe that anybody can be that stupid. i enjoy my apple products and i even own a decent amount of apple stock, but people like you who just repeat marketing propaganda from apple used to defend against anti competitive measures are really cultivating the image of mindless apple sheep.\\n\\nfirst of all, citing the os market share for desktop and mobile apps is totally missing the point here.\\nif you own a smartphone in most parts of these worlds, you will likely use an ios and android device. if you own such a device, the app store and google play store will amount to 95% of the total revenue generated by mobile app stores. if you own an android device, the play store is by far the market leader and has a quasi monopolistic market share, but other app stores have emerged allow viable alternatives like f-droid.\\nif you own an iphone, you only have one choices and it’s apple. they are a monopolist in their ecosystem.\\nyou also have to keep in mind that device market share can not be used to argue for the app store market share, because iphones are premium devices, while android devices are sold at a huge price range. people in third world countries who got an android for $50 are not in the market for a $5/month subscription, while someone who has paid $500-1500 for a iphone will likely spend more money on apps and subscription services \\nthis is the reason why the apple app store is the leading store regarding revenue and profits. your numbers are totally useless and i have no idea why you thought that this would be a good idea.\\n\\nin the end i am really glad that more and more markets are establishing consumer protection laws and allow choice so that people like you who lack the brain capacity and knowledge to understand why it’s bad that the largest store front for mobile digital purchases doesn’t allow any competition, can still benefit when more intelligent people with push laws and regulations.\\n\\nif people like you would have the power, we would use archaic bell “internet” on slow and ridiculously expensive ibm computers.   \n",

playing from the \"subscription\"?  the whole point of scrobbling for me is to keep track of what i was listening to, and to be able to go back and find \"that song i liked when i was driving past another amazon warehouse\".  yet another reason to stick with spotify.  fml. i'm glad i sold my apple stock!  this company is committing slow suicide.   \n",

clarify i read bill gate's 1st book more than a quarter century ago because the press portrayed him as such a tech rock star and my mom sent him a catalogue of her furniture design because she read an interview of him having difficulty picking out chairs, tables and coaches for his home.\\n\\n&gt; dang, you got me. i'm sure you would have picked all the winners. i withdraw my original comment.\\n\\ni made moves to sign up for e*trade in 2008 to indulge my apple fanboi impulses by buying $aapl.\\n\\nback then i was irrationally in love with the company because of their awesome products. so why not own part of a resurging company?\\n\\ni failed to execute out of intimidation with the documentary requirements. dumb of me not to reach out to family and friends who do stock trading to make sense of what i needed to send back to e*trade.\\n\\ni had this money on hand at the time. dumbass me would go all in one 1 company because i believed in the reality distortion field generator known as steve jobs.\\n\\n|date|20-jan-2009|30-jul-2022|\\n:-:|:-:|:-:|\\n|forex: $ = ₱|₱40.29|₱55.36|\\n|$/share|$78.20|$162.51|\\n|number of shares (28-for-1 split: pre vs

shares tanked of late due to people cutting their subscriptions. my guess is they're all fed up covid-induced binge watching and want to be social being again.\\n\\nfrom my 2 decades of download perspective netflix serves subscribers who\\n\\n- do not want to become datahoarders\\n- want to pay the equivalent of a cable subscription\\n- want the flexibility of anywhere with a 5mbps or better internet connection i can watch hollywood-class productions\\n- live in countries with isps that actually block p2p file sharing\\n\\nthis is unlike those other companies i mentioned that had other business units to lean on when lean times impacted a leg.   \n",

$h\\^1(\\\\mathbb{r}) \\\\subsetneq l\\^2(\\\\mathbb{r})$. this is an (unbounded) self-adjoint operator. $u(t)=\\\\exp(ith)$ is the translation operator $(u(t)f)(x)=f(x+t)$. thus, for any $f\\\\in l\\^2(\\\\mathbb{r})$, $\\\\lim\\_{t\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\lvert u(t)f - f \\\\rvert\\_{l\\^2}\\^2 = 2 \\\\lvert f \\\\rvert\\_{l\\^2}\\^2$.\\n\\nyou can also cook up a counter-example using the usual schrodinger hamiltonian $h=-\\\\partial\\_x\\^2$. say, a dispersing (and/or translating) wavepacket [\\[video link\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icjzm6nhzek), which is an exercise in most intro qm courses.\\n\\nwhat is true (and what the argument in the video shows) is:\\n\\n**proposition.** *if $h$ is a self-adjoint operator on a hilbert space $\\\\mathcal{h}$ \\*and $\\\\psi\\\\in \\\\mathcal{h}$ is orthogonal to the continuous spectrum of h\\* then, for any $\\\\epsilon&gt;0$, there exist a $t=t(\\\\psi)$ arbitrarily large such that $\\\\lvert u(t)\\\\psi - \\\\psi \\\\rvert &lt; \\\\epsilon$.*\\n\\nphysicists often act like all of their hamiltonians have pure point spectrum. usually this is a harmless abuse of notation, but here it actually matters. in the counterexamples above, the spectrum is absolutely continuous. this is actually typical in qm. for example, if our hamiltonian is the schrodinger hamiltonian $h=\\\\triangle+v$ and $v$ is a reasonable decaying potential, then the spectrum of $h$ consists of the nonnegative real axis and finitely many eigenvalues. (if $v$ is coulombic, we can have an infinite discrete set of eigenvalues. either way, we have a whole half-axis worth of spectrum.)\\n\\nps. the sho is one of the few infinite dimensional examples from introductory qm where there is no continuous spectrum. this has to do with the fact that the potential is growing rapidly at infinity (ergo *not* decaying).   \n",

done with acting as he had been blacklisted from hollywood and didn’t need the work thanks to having bought apple stock in the 1980s……\\n\\nso, he’s willing and able to be quite open about what he thinks, and routinely uses that freedom to sound off on hot-button issues on twitter, where he’s known for being a right-leaning dissident, particularly on cultural topics.\\n\\n➖and now he’s back at it, this time sounding off on the topic of electric vehicles, cars that have somehow become the current thing despite being almost unusable for road trips or basic tasks expected of them.\\n\\nwoods, however, in his criticism of electric cars doesn’t focus on those typical, mundane problems with them. having to wait forever for them to charge, dealing with the tech as it matures and the batteries slowly become more useful, the problems posed by lithium fires…all those problems are real and must be dealt with, but they’ve already been brought up and will be endlessly debated.\\n\\nso, in his attack on evs, woods brought up the safety issue associated with them, something that no one else has really focused on as of yet.\\n\\ntweeting about that, woods said:\\n\\n&gt;the unspoken nightmare of owning an electric vehicle is the safety issue. a woman alone forced to sit for an hour charging her ev on a dark highway is not a comforting scenario, except to the roving gangs of hoodie thugs roaming our streets and highways.\\n\\nand while there aren’t many articles on that topic yet, the problem of women being harassed at a gas station is a very real one. harassment is already a real problem at gas stations, where fill ups currently just take a few minutes. think how bad that problem will be if charging takes an hour or more. \\n\\nclean technica, for instance, ran a good article highlighting current problems with gas stations and electric vehicle charging, saying:\\n\\n&gt;ev charging operators need to prioritize safety — especially women’s safety. our friends at irishevs shared two articles with me that touch upon safety issues that women are dealing with while charging their evs while traveling. they highlight how ev charging operators need to take safety into account in order to not lose/miss customers and also simply make sure their stations are safe places to charge.\\n\\n&gt;…..\\n\\n&gt;there are countless stories of women being harassed at gas stations. just last month in atlanta, a woman was shot and killed at a gas station. so, our friends at irishevs are making an excellent point about safety at ev charging sites — especially women’s safety.\\n\\ngas stations are already problem areas from a safety perspective, particularly as crime spikes and soft-on-crime policies embolden criminals. that’ll likely just get worse as the evs take long times to charge and criminals continue to be emboldened.\\n\\n###[‘sitting ducks’: ev charging stations leave some drivers feeling exposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/vf3yl3/sitting_ducks_ev_charging_stations_leave_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\ncharging an ev is more complicated and time consuming than pulling up to a well-lit service station with cameras and attendants nearby and refuelling in mere minutes. it takes at least 20 minutes to charge, if you’re lucky enough to find a dc fast charger that can charge at the speeds promised by auto makers. if you can only find a level 2 charger, you could be at the station for hours.\\n\\n…..\\n\\nin the united states, there have been reports of car robberies at ev stations dating back to 2015.   \n",

apps. at first it was nice to fiddle with third party options for everything with x extra feature or y better feature. but now i’m older and i value a lot more stability and peace of mind. not needing to install or sync anything. \\n\\nexamples: used bear, obsidian, evernote…ended up with apple notes as second brain. plenty powerful of you master it. you’ll never have any issue or lose anything. \\n\\nsame with fantastical and their greedy practices the last few years, or chrome, or yt music, or spark, or things…i even stopped using bettertouchtool a while ago. \\n\\nfor me, less is more, i just want what i have to work without issues, or waking up any day to a new subscription transition, new version paywall, etc. just peace of mind. and i assure you each apple stock app looks simple but packs a punch if you take the time to master it.\\n\\ntldr: i don’t refuse to use any apple app. that’s the whole point of choosing the apple ecosystem.   \n",

unlikely. blockchains are good for de-centralization and security. stock markets require transactions per second, not seconds per transaction. they need speeds that no blockchain can achieve without a less centralized, less secure layer sitting on top of it.\\n\\nit would definitely be nice to have more transparency and security in the market, but (as much as i would love to see hft and dark pools go away) blockchains are simply too slow. also, we already tried icos. how did that work out? think of how many bored apes have been stolen by hackers versus major blocks of amazon or apple stock.\\n\\n&amp;#x200b;\\n\\n&gt;i've read the transcript of this podcast\\n\\nit's not a podcast. maybe actually click the link.\\n\\n&amp;#x200b;\\n\\n&gt;instead of reading the white papers and thinking about the possibilities \\n\\n\"ah, yes, the \"do your own research, bro\" argument. i have read a lot of analysis by actual software experts, i suspect most of your sources are heavily invested in crypto.\\n\\nif you want analysis by an actual computer scientist, here you go:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xchab0dnnj4\\n\\n&amp;#x200b;\\n\\n&gt;it's a very democratizing advance\\n\\ndo you know how \"proof of stake\" works? it's basically the rule of the few. the gini coefficient of the crypto space is over 90% (compared to 42% for the us). this is the polar opposite of \"democratizing\". early adopters and whales dominate crypto and always will. \\n\\nif you're already a crypto whale, congratulations. if you missed out or got in late, you should be rooting

here, about 95% through transitioning from on prem to azure. if you are just going straight azure ad i don't think you get any gpos, azure ad is not the same animal as on prem ad. however, if you use intune to manage your azure joined pcs (which is what i am doing) then you can setup similar security groups to divide out policies, and create config profiles or scripts to set the restrictions your gpos did previously. if you have azuread connect setup, then if you have it setup right it would sync your existing groups in your on prem, to azure. this would make you a hybrid setup though, which i would not recommend. what i did was used intune, and 1:1 replaced our gpos with configuration policies or powershell scripts. you can hybrid join pretty easily and doesn't require a reinstall or profile wipe. but hybrid sucks from what i have seen. much easier to just use intune and buy microsoft stock because this is the new way of doing things.   \n",

                  #### okse fundamental analysis ####\\n\\nokse is the first non-custodial wallet directly with a visa card. it is made available to more than 170 countries with all transactions being on chain and also enable payment with crypto in more than 60 million merchants worldwide.\\n\\nthe okse wallet is a defi payments platform designed to revolutionize the financial market. it aims to replace all third parties in a financial transaction with smart contracts — so that users can avoid unnecessary fees as well as credit/debit card fraud.\\n\\nokse card functions like a debit card backed by a very strong belief in a decentralized financial system.\\n\\nwith the okse card you can spend and top up tokens like, bnb, busd, usdt, avax, usdc , ftm and several others.\\n\\nokse utility token called $okse can be use to apply as a discount option and as a valuable asset to increase your daily spending or top up limit for your okse card . apart from that, it can also be use to participate in protocol governance and to vote on proposals , staking , payment and rewards of up to 5% of the monthly subscription .\\n\\nhaving done a thorough research and due diligence about the okse project , i strongly believe that this project will appreciate better in the market .\\n\\nthe okse project is based on several networks (chain) and are backed by reputable investors such as the cypher capital, celer network and already gain limelight across the globe .\\n\\nwith some recent developments in the crypto industry and some major industries such as stocks, tech e.t.c, this project is coming in at the right time .\\n\\nrecently, mercado libre which is the latin america’s largest e-commerce company launched its own cryptocurrency for its 80 million users in brazil . also, the recent one from samsung ,which is one of the high reputable company in the world launches into the metaverse with its own game and also google ($googl) has invested $1.56 billion into blockchain companies till this moment . the recent $430 billion inflation reduction act signed by the president of the united state can’t be understate because it will reduce the persistence increase in inflation rate and have a positive impact on the economy and purchasing power of the citizen .\\n\\nthe adoption of cryptocurrency has increase drastically of recent and this will help a lot of new project to appreciate provided they have a strong utility and backing . the okse project has what it takes to appreciate in both the short run and the long run .\\n\\nalthough the underlying economic condition and situation around the globe must be taking into consideration such as the persistence increase in inflation , high interest rate , economic unrest of some nations, taxation rate and demand/supply which may just have a little effect on the performance of this project in the short run .\\n\\nconclusively , with the spend-to-earn mechanism entails in the okse project and using of the okse card on different tokens to purchase goods, i strongly believe this project will appreciate in due time . most people will surely adopt the use of the okse wallet and card because it will be easier for them to open an account at your convenient time and purchase any goods you want more than the conventional bank account which has some kind of stress in it .\\nspend your crypto

this is what got me digging.\\n\\ni saw this segment this morning live on cnbc  and decided to look around for other sources on chris schwarz and his paper. becky segways from bath so i didn't want to post it.\\n\\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/01/new-study-shows-no-fee-trading-may-be-costing-investors-34-billion.html\\n\\ni had a listen to the recorded version and they trimmed it. i decided to post the link as a source  for some additional information. for those who do not want to click the link i did a rough transcript.\\n\\nintro after bath segway\\n\\nbecky: trading has been done by retail investors on platforms that often offer zero commission trading. however, there's a new study out that shows no fee trading isn't what it seems, and it may be costing investors billions\\nof dollars a year. \\n\\njoining us now is one of the authors of that study, christopher schwarz. he is a finance professor at university of ca. irvine. \\n\\nchris, let's talk about this study because when i saw it, it really grabbed my attention. \\n\\n*you went about doing this with some other professors, you put your own money\\nat work executing trades, did the trades simultaneously over 5 different platforms, and found some very wide differences in terms of what you ended up getting with those charges. i guess its proof that there is no free\\nlunch.\\n\\nchris: cough, cough. we basically, what happened was we were doing another\\nstudy and we opened a brokerage account, and we decided to do one other brokerage account in parallel, so nothing related to this, and after the first day the one account lost $150, and the other brokerage account\\nactually made $12.\\n\\nwhat we found that lead us to this rabbit-hole that you talked about was we ended placing an 85k trades for $17m dollars over 5 1/2 months on 6 different brokerage accounts. \\n\\nbasically we found that the very best broker, you lost about 7 basis points on a round-trip trade. so on a $1k trade, you lose about .70c. \\n\\non the very worst broker, you actually lose about 46 basis points, $4.60.\\n\\nthe spread between the best and the worst broker was almost 6 ½ times the cost.\\n\\nbecky: which is shocking! i mean, there had to be reasons behind that. what did you find?\\n\\n*chris: what the sec would probably tell you is pfof, but what we actually found was that there was no relation between the variation of payment for order flow and the variation or execution.\\n\\njust to give you a concrete example our #1 broker has pfof, but our #3 &amp; #5,\\nin terms of execution and price actually don't have pfof. so that didn'texplain it.\\n\\nultimately, what we found was, essentially the market centers, though as you know when you place a retail trade now it doesn't go to an exchange it goes to citadel, virtu, or some other market center. \\n\\nbasically the market centers were giving different pricing to different brokers. so you would have 2 trades go to the same market center at the same time and get radically different pricing on a consistent basis. \\n\\nbecky: chris what did citadel and virtu have to say when you reached out to them? \\n\\nchris:  so, you know, basically all of them said that each broker has a different value for their order flow. so, just to give you an idea, if i'm a brokerage and i have one person buy apple stock and one sell apple stock, that's great for the market maker because they can just cross the 2 trades and make a profit.\\n\\nbut if all of us go out and buy bath at the same time, then obviously that is incredibly expensive order flow for the market centers, like i'm guessing right now citadel, virtu and others wish they didn't have to actually fill orders for that stock. \\n\\nso the explanation we got was, basically the value, or the profitability for order flow from different brokers is different. \\n\\nbecky: when i read this study i was kind of amazed because when you read free trades you think it's free trades but obviously there are costs behind the scenes.   \n",

were not in folders and radarr did not like that. instead of manually moving them all into their respective folder (say `/movie (2000).mkv` -&gt; `/movie (2000)/movie (2000).mkv`) i made a quick and dirty powershell script to do that for me. just change the extension to whatever files are to be moved:\\n\\n\\n    $vs = dir *.mkv\\n    \\n    foreach($v in $vs)\\n    {\\n        $file = $v.basename\\n    \\n        md $file &gt;$null\\n    \\n        move-item $v -destination $file\\n    }        \\n\\ni am sure it could be condensed and optimized but it worked.\\n\\nit will not remove or move things into existing folders, it just iterates the directory where it is executed from and if a folder does not exist it makes it and moves the file there. any others are left where they were. actually as a happy accident because of this it found a few duplicate movies saving me some storage space.\\n\\neverything is working fine now. thanks again for the input!   \n",

indicated that revenue is still rising despite the drop of subscriptions, also we’re going to be going through an er recession so everything will be most likely coming in red. aside from that the debt has dropped from last year, i wouldn’t make this more than 5-10% of my overall portfolio but i know vz would be one of the companies to get bailed out if it came to that, given that their demographic is people with middle to high income (given their price and fast connection). i know there has been some issues with the 5g bandwidth in certain states, however i don’t see it affecting their overall retention of subscriptions more than their recent rise on prices. i am fully aware of their debt and livabilities, but me personally i don’t see the company failing, i will say that maybe in a year or so (whenever the next bull run starts for the market) i’ll be transferring over to $avgo since their semiconductors are usually used for telecommunications (t,vz,tmus), i’ll be a cut for the yield but at least i’ll get more stock appreciation and a modest yield (3.6%), it’s gonna suck leaving that nice 7% but gotta go with the better option longterm.   \n",

file-handling on the web, but those scripts are probably more for the more technical people anyway, they are single-line-only and can get very convoluted.\\n\\nit's probably better just to ask yourself what you find interesting and implement that step by step\\n\\nhere's my filesort-string after sucessful tagging, it took 15 years to hone and just now once again feels adequate

like the entire rest of the market ???? lol meta is only down until it pivots again into the next iteration and rises back up again. people betting against the future are stupid. mark zuckerberg did not create the concept of virtual or augmented reality, he is simply latching on to the early innovations and promoting the hell out of his own innovations to the already existing framework. vr will be widely used in just about every facet of life within the next couple of decades or so, just like the internet, smartphones, social media, etc. zuck realized facebook’s prime had passed and decided to move into a space that has ‘industry not yet in its prime’ written all over it. he jumped in early, maybe too early, but soon enough, the rest of the market will catch up. competitors will start to fill out the space even more and make meta work even harder to stay ‘on top’. that’s when the masses of the population will step in and start to take part, bringing it even closer to ideal vision mark is trying to lay out right now. the iphone was created in 2007? now just look at everybody and their smart phones. inseparable. i don’t think the metaverse using vr and ar is that crazy of an idea, in fact, mark zuckerberg has probably spent billions and billions of dollars just to try and prove just how not crazy of an idea it actually is. in my opinion, the world will adapt to the metaverse overtime, just like horseback riders adapted to driving cars, and fax machine operators resorted to sending emails, and house phones turned into mobile phones. eventually, certain aspects of life and activities themselves will start to take place online inside sorts of digital worlds, and it will be a normal everyday thing. until then i’m staying away from $meta solely because of people’s generally negative sentiment towards the whole movement, but it wouldn’t be a bad choice to keep meta on the radar for, well, the indefinite future. time’ll tell   \n",

bought dark sky. what you see from the apple stock weather app is a redesigned dark sky. if you’re looking to pay a subscription than the other weather app that a lot of people absolutely love for it’s quirky weather descriptions is carrot. personally i think the stock weather app does a decent job, just wish it’s notifications were better.   \n",

fake results about ad click and subscription by facebook, which was even confirmed by their whistle blower. buy this shit and look where it gets ya   \n",

          nio is investing into infra structure with the swap stations which takes long, and since it’s past poc it should within couple years start to show exponential growth. swap stations is the ultimate differentiator in most populous parts where 1) owning extra land/personal parking garage is merely a super luxury or unimaginable and 2) fast charging is detrimental for overall battery life. nio should outcompete many others over time and will come out as a winner in selling cars in volume and by then profit from swap stations will eventually become a big proportion and very profitable. remember apple stock is considered a cash flow business because of subscriptions. nio will be monetizing heavily over swap station subscriptions.   \n",

2020 i talked to one of them about investing in good companies; how to find them, what numbers to look at, how to read their quarterly fillings, etc. i had been on ballstreetwets for a few months and wanted to invest \"smartly\" so as to avoid posting any loss porn.\\n\\nall he said to me was \"oh i don't really know much about those numbers or reports. but me and [the other friend] both have subscriptions to motley fool and i have one to cnbc for their stock picks. i can send them to you if you want... we usually chat about what we think are good companies based on the data from the emails, then invest.\"\\n\\ni couldn't believe my ears. this dude who definitely can talk the talk when it comes to trading was just using shitty advice from market manipulators? man, back then even *i* knew that motley fool was basically a scam.\\n\\nstumbling into this saga has been one of the most fascinating journeys i've ever been on. it only sucks because no one wants to listen to what's really going on in the stock market. people are convinced that the money they give to fudelity to buy apple stock will eventually make it's way to apple's bank account.   \n",

what does anyone mean by \"inequality\"?\\n\\nbill gates, for example, would have been a trillionaire if he hadn't listened to buffet and diversified out of his microsoft stock. does the fact that he has less net wealth than musk on paper due to him making a worse economic decision make anyone else's life better or worse? \\n\\nmuch of the world is in abject poverty due to corrupt leadership at the governmental level. this includes places like north korea, but also places like california, where the government had the largest pool of revenue from silicon valley and hollywood workers, with the highest tax rate in the nation, but still found ways to squander it all and simultaneously create programs that screwed over the poor. oh, the poor and middle class need housing? well, we're going to add 20 layers of inspectors when 2-3 could work, and add more months of build time to a house, add more costs to a house, and create an inflationary spiral for homes mixed with low interest rates to make houses extremely expensive over time, make people need to make more income (and therefore pay higher taxes) to afford the same home, pay way higher property tax, and make them unaffordable for normal americans. this wasn't borne out of \"inequality\" but rather complete ineptitude of politicians with zero background in economics and consequences. \\n\\non top of this, companies and government incentivize people to completely stupid things. oh, you make 40k a year but you want to express yourself? well, you shouldn't need to save. buy 6 dollar coffee every day. buy a ps5. buy season laker tickets. buy netflix and hbo subscriptions. buy organic kale. go on 3 vacations a year for 2k each. go gamble away your money at vegas for fun. buy your girlfriend a 15 thousand dollar ring just because society says so. what people don't realize is that most people, even those who have the capacity to, save absolutely no money ever. i know people who drive m3s and m4s making way less money than me. of course poor people are going to remain poor if they spend every dollar they have as soon as they get it. there was a period in my life where i made less than 40k, and i saved like the devil was after me. i didn't lease a fancy bmw, i ate out very rarely, i didn't go on vacation, and i didn't rent a huge apartment. as i made more, i spent more, but i probably spent very little for the first 5 or so years of my professional career and spent time on my craft. my income went up every year, my savings went up every year, and i began to invest extremely deliberately. \\n\\nso with me starting from nothing, i grew my net wealth every year. and most of the people around me spent everything every year. so now, today, i have much higher net worth than most people my age. it's ridiculous to just frame things as inequality = bad if there is no context. \\n\\ninequality is primarily an effort and saving issue, and where it is not, it is a government competency issue.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                 all the sigils in the article seem pretty redundant. first, all $ tells you is essentially 'this is a variable'. of course, i'm not an expert in raku or any language that uses sigils, really, so i may be misunderstanding something, or missing some crucial information. still, the below argument is based on the information in the article.\\n\\n@ and % convey essentially no useful information which isn't already present in context: if i see `@my_arr[5]`, i already know from the `[5]` part that `my_arr` is an array that takes numeric indices. similarly, % in `%my_map[\"hello\"]` is similarly redundant. the same information is present in looping, for example: if i see `for $v in @my_arr`, i already know that `my_arr` is something that can be looped over; i don't need @ to tell me. finally, i question that the distinction between @ and % is particularly meaningful; even if it is, it seems that one could move this distinction where it actually matters: iteration. for example, one could require that iteration is always ordered, so you could iterate through arrays normally (`for v in arr`), but you'd need to call a function for maps (`for k, v in map.items()`), where the contract for `items()` specifies that the ordering is arbitrary.\\n\\nin the same vein, with `&amp;my_func()`, the only meaningful information `&amp;` conveys is that we're calling a variable rather than a function called 'my_func'. in this sense, rather than a sigil, we can interpret '&amp;' as being essentially the dereference operator in c. i don't really mind this usage, actually, as it *is* useful information.\\n\\nregarding the point made later about (if i understand correctly) automatically assigning a type to a variable based on the sigil used to declare it, it makes much more sense to me to have the type be encoded in the value rather than the variable: instead of `my @arr = 1, 2, 3`, with `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, i know from my knowledge of the language that `[1, 2, 3]` is an expression of array type. also, in initialization the value being assigned is always close to the variable be initialized, so there's no concern about how accessible the type is.   \n",

                                               a man who has dedicated his career to deception and saying whatever ill informed voters want to hear... has lied to you once again.  he said he was going to cure cancer.  he actually reiterated most of trump's policies in that campaign speech.  that was not a state of the union.. unless our union is now called ukraine.  if you're on reddit you know how to access information, albeit, if reddit is your best ball.. you're grossly misinformed.  shame on you for not being an informed voter.  shame on you for believing that trump was corrupt.  the wind has changed and there's a reason establishment gop reps hated trump as much as the left... he upset their whole corrupt system they have been living high on for years.  trump slashed prescription drug costs.  trump got rid of tpp.  if you don't know what that was/is... you're not informed.  america first with or without trump is the way of the walk.  please tell me you know that our own state dept states unequivocally that mail in voting (in other countries) automatically means fraud.  please tell me you know that our own state dept said the huge influx of midnight votes in russia meant fraud.  you are getting conned.  please for the love of our great nation, wake up.  believe nothing the media tells you.  look at those who are censored when we have a 1st amendment and understand... if someone is censored and removed from the internet... they were telling the truth.  how much more flip flopping do you need to see before your eyes.  the cdc, big pharma, russian collusion hoax... good god.  it goes on and on and on.  funny how theese mistakes put literally billions of dollars into the hands of their biggest corporate donors.  green new deal you say... just take a look at oil prices and xom stock price.  follow the money and for the love of god open your eyes.   \n",

      "1413                                                                                                                                           as the pandemic set in, investors including warren buffett ditched shares of occidental petroleum corp. now, the oil-and-gas producer is the best-performing stock in the s&amp;p 500 this year, and a newfound favorite of the veteran investor.\\n\\nmore than two years after selling off its common shares of occidental, mr. buffett’s berkshire hathaway inc. is the company’s largest shareholder with about 20% of its stock, according to recent filings, and mr. buffett received regulatory approval friday to buy up to 50%.\\n\\nbuoyed by soaring commodity prices, occidental has substantially paid down its debt load and is generating cash. the company now looks like a strong fit for mr. buffett, say investors and analysts. it is strengthening its balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders; it holds the largest position in the most active u.s. oil field; and it is investing in technologies to reduce carbon emissions, which some of mr. buffett’s businesses are also doing.\\n\\n“it checks off a lot of his boxes,” said steven check, chief investment officer of check capital management, which is invested in berkshire. “it’s american, it has great cash flow and it’s a rational capital allocator.”\\n\\nmr. buffett has publicly praised the strategy of occidental chief executive officer vicki hollub, and many analysts have speculated berkshire could buy the entire company. mr. buffett hasn’t informed occidental of any plans to acquire a controlling stake in the company and is unlikely to do so in the near-term, people familiar with the matter say.\\n\\n“what vicki hollub was saying made nothing but sense,” mr. buffett said at berkshire’s recent annual shareholder meeting. “and i decided that it was a good place to put berkshire’s money.”\\n\\nunder ms. hollub’s leadership, occidental has cut its debt load, repurchased shares and raised its dividends. like other companies, it has also been conservative about boosting production, despite oil prices rising.\\n\\nthat strategy is paying off. occidental generated a record $4.35 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter and $3.7 billion in profit. after its shares fell roughly 80% in 2020, occidental’s stock has jumped 146% this year, a rally driven, in part, by mr. buffett’s purchases.\\n\\nthe company still faces challenges. long-term doubts remain about demand for oil and gas as some countries shift to greener energy sources and some investors remain wary of the industry. occidental is also betting big on carbon capture, a technology whose profitability is unproven.\\n\\noccidental entered the pandemic saddled with debt from a $38 billion deal to take over rival anadarko petroleum corp., part of which it funded with $10 billion from berkshire. plunging oil prices led the company to lay off employees and cut executives’ salaries—including ms. hollub’s—and slash expenses in the oil patch.\\n\\nbut while the deal looked ill-timed, analysts say, the assets occidental acquired from anadarko have since helped solidify its position as the largest producer in the permian basin, the prolific shale oil field in west texas and new mexico. the company said it produced roughly half a million barrels of oil a day domestically in the second quarter of the year, compared with about 280,000 barrels before it acquired anadarko.\\n\\noccidental has said it generates a profit when oil prices are as low as $40 a barrel. in the second quarter of the year, brent crude oil prices averaged $114.1 per barrel and u.s. crude prices averaged $109.9 per barrel, according to scotiabank.\\n\\nall facts point to occidental being a play on domestic oil production for mr. buffett, said bill stone, chief investment officer of glenview trust, which held shares of both berkshire and occidental as of the end of the second quarter.\\n\\nmr. buffett has also boosted his purchases of chevron corp. this year, making it berkshire’s fourth-largest holding.\\n\\noccidental has said it aims to reach net-zero emissions on its operations and energy use by 2040. the company has invested in carbon removal through its oxy low carbon ventures and plans to develop the first industrial-scale plant to capture carbon dioxide from the air, which it says will require upward of $1 billion in investment.\\n\\nthe company’s focus on becoming a greener operator may inform mr. buffett’s appetite, analysts said. berkshire’s energy unit, berkshire hathaway energy, has stated a goal of retiring its coal units by 2049 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\\n\\noccidental intends to develop 70 plants to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2035, it told investors in march. it has said it would invest between $100 million and $300 million through its low-carbon unit this year. investment bank truist securities said in a june note that more than 10% of occidental’s total business could come from its carbon capture division in a couple of years, up from less than 5% currently.\\n\\nthe $433 billion climate package president biden signed into law this month could accelerate the development of carbon-capture projects, industry experts say. the legislation raises the tax credit for direct air carbon capture and sequestration to $180 per metric ton from $50 previously.\\n\\nthe credits are helpful for carbon capture businesses, but some scientists say it is unrealistic to deploy the technology on a large scale because it needs huge amounts of energy, while some environmental groups say it could prolong fossil fuel consumption.\\n\\nms. hollub told investors earlier this month that the climate package was a good development for the company, pointing to the tax credits as one reason why “this is turning into for us a net very positive bill.”\\n\\nmr. buffett has long been a buyer of oil and gas ventures, not always successfully. in 2008, he bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gas prices were near a peak, just before they fell.\\n\\n“the terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars,” mr. buffett wrote in the company’s 2008 annual report.\\n\\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/how-occidental-petroleum-captured-warren-buffetts-eye-11661168917   \n",
      "1484  &gt;oil production in the iraqi region of kurdistan could almost halve by 2027 if there is no new exploration or major investment in the sector, government documents seen by reuters showed.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;a steep decline in oil revenue, a lifeline for the kurdish regional government (krg), would compound the economic woes of a region already struggling financially within an unstable iraq, diplomats, officials, and energy experts said.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;according to the documents, the kurdistan region in iraq's (kri) oil output could rise to 580,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five year's time under a scenario in which investment is fully optimised, leaving 530,000 bpd available for export.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;but without new investment, the semi-autonomous region might only have 240,000 bpd available to export as older wells become depleted, the documents, which have not previously been reported, show.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"it is very dangerous,\" said kri parliamentarian karwan gaznay, who is a member of the region's oil and gas committee.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"we should be alarmed by it, but it will not be a real issue if we sort out our problems with the iraqi government, then kurdistan can develop new blocks and increase production. we have a lot of reservoirs,\" he said.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the krg did not respond to a request for comment.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;under the iraqi constitution, the region is entitled to a portion of the national budget. but the arrangement collapsed in 2014 when the kurds seized control of iraq's main northern oilfields in kirkuk from islamic state and began selling crude from there independently.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;in 2018, iraqi forces retook disputed territories, including the oil city of kirkuk, and baghdad resumed some budget payments but they have been sporadic. so far this year, it has sent two payments of 200 billion iraqi dinars ($137 million). natural decline  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;krg's debt currently stands at about $38 billion, according to a government official, and lawmaker gaznay said oil exports accounted for 85% of the region's budget.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the krg's financial position has improved this year thanks to surging oil prices following russia's invasion of ukraine but a steep decline in output would significantly increase its fiscal constraints.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the region's oil output has already slipped from about 468,000 bpd in 2019 to 445,000 last year and 434,000 in the first quarter of 2022, according to reports by deloitte.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"the reason that the current oil production is going down is due to the inability of the ministry of natural resources to bring timely additional investment online to overcome the natural decline of 15% to 20% each year in production for each well,\" a source in the krg said.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the government documents said falls in output at three major oilfields - tawke, khurmala and taq taq - are the main reason for decline.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the potential slide in the kurdish region's oil output makes it important for the government to boost gas production, but a project to expand one of the biggest fields in iraq has been suspended due to security concerns. read more  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the oil in the region comes from drilling into fractures in limestone rocks. this initially results in high yields, but aggressive levels of production can rapidly drain the fractures and lead to water flooding in, energy experts said.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;rising water levels in several fields, including taq taq, have made it harder to access the oil, according to a government official and energy experts, who put the rapid depletion of the wells down to bad management and the challenging geology.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;energy experts and industry sources say attracting more investment could save the region from sliding into insolvency, but the difficult investment climate is getting in the way.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"there is some field expansions, which are slow. companies are finding it hard to get approvals and there haven't been significant new discoveries for several years now,\" said robin mills, chief executive of consultancy qamar energy.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"without big new developments they risk going into decline in the near future,\" he said. oil sector setbacks  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the kurdish region has proven oil reserves of less than 3 billion barrels at most, based on the most optimistic forecast, according to the krg source, only a tiny fraction of iraq's overall proven reserves of more than 140 billion barrels.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;and the region's energy sector has faced a number of recent setbacks.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;an iraqi federal supreme court ruling in february deemed the legal foundations of the oil and gas sector in the region to be unconstitutional, forcing some foreign firms, including u.s. oilfield services companies schlumberger (slb.n), baker hughes (bkr.o) and halliburton (hal.n), to leave read more  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the upcoming decision in an arbitration case dating back to 2014 between turkey and iraq about the oil export pipeline that runs between the two countries is also sending ripples of uncertainty through foreign firms still in the kurdish region.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;iraq claims turkey has violated an agreement by giving the kurdish region access to the pipeline without baghdad's approval.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;the final hearing at the international chamber of commerce in paris was in july and there will be a final decision in the next few months, according to iraq's oil ministry and sources familiar with the matter.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;foreign oil investors first came to kurdistan in the era of former iraqi president saddam hussein, when the region was considered more stable and secure than the rest of iraq.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;but the region's star has started to fade, with the big foreign firms deterred by tensions between the region and the central government in iraq, a string of downgrades to iraqi kurdistan's oil reserves and security problems.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;now kurdistan only has a handful of small and medium-sized operators, many of which complain about the difficult operating environment. if the investment environment does not improve kurdistan risks further withdrawals.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"(kurds) are living a dream and don't want to wake up,\" the krg source said.   \n",

8, 2022 12:40 gmt+3:\\n\\n&gt;moscow/houston, oct 7 (reuters) - russian president vladimir putin has signed a decree, published on friday, to set up a new operator for the sakhalin 1 oil and gas project, following similar steps to seize other oil and gas projects with foreign participation.\\n\\n&gt;exxon mobil corp (xom.n), with a 30% stake, was the operator of sakhalin-1, a development in russia's far east. the largest u.s. producer has been trying to exit russia operations since march, days after moscow's invasion of ukraine. exxon declined to comment on friday's decree.\\n\\n&gt;in april, exxon took a $4.6 billion impairment charge for exiting its russian activities, leaving sakhalin-1 operation open for a takeover from a partner. it also proceeded to reduce oil and gas production volumes and remove personnel from the country.\\n\\n&gt;in august, putin issued the presidential decree 520 which exxon said impedes the company to conclude the exit safely. the producer then escalated the dispute and issued a note of difference that could ultimately end up in an arbitration process.\\n\\n&gt;exxon's head of upstream operations said on tuesday it was still working with its partners on its exit. a transfer of operation to a partner would be a positive outcome for exxon.   \n",

for dividends, capital gains/losses, and interest, respectively. \\n\\ndividend income, capital gains/losses, and interest income all factor into your total personal income with your wages, self-employment income, etc. and tax gets calculated off that.  some of your dividends might be qualified for tax purposes, and some may be considered ordinary dividends (reits, bdcs). short-term capital gains get taxed like ordinary dividends and w-2 income. long-term capital gains get a better rate (below).\\n\\nqualified dividend income and long-term capital gains to some extent can get a more preferential tax rate (0%, 15%, 20%).\\n\\nif you buy an mlp in a taxable account, like $epd or $iep or $ab, then you'll get a k-1. this is a much more complex tax form that does not reflect the dividends your brokerage account says you got from the mlp. a k-1 will take a good 15-20 minutes to read through to know what goes where in your tax return. a form k-1 will likely require a higher-tier subscription level if you are doing your own return on turbotax, taxslayer, or other software.   \n",

to say about the state of oil field services going forward:\\n\\n*turning now to the macro. we have strengthened our view in a multiyear upcycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth. despite concerns over the slowdown of global growth rates and the potential for recession, the fundamentals for energy as a critical resource remain very constructive.*  \\n\\n\\n* *first, in the near term, a seasonal uptick in demand as winter approaches is pitted against a very intricate supply landscape for both oil and gas through the end of the year. this situation is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crisis in europe. looking further out into the horizon, the demand-supply picture remains delicate, with this imbalance amplified by geopolitics, increased instances of supply disruptions and limited spare global capacity.*\\n* *second, the growing necessity of energy security and supply-source diversification will also bring -- also drive urgent increases in energy investment. a significant step-up in investment is required to create supply redundancies, rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth.*\\n* *and third, recent opec+ decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation -- operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions. taken together, these dynamics will result in a supply-led upcycle characterized by resilient upstream investment that is decoupled from near-term demand volatility.*  \\n\\n\\n*we expect investment growth will be durable, reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory, multi-year capacity expansion plans, lower operating breakeven prices and supportive commodity prices. growth will be simultaneous in north america and in the international markets. this started first in the north america market, and we are already witnessing the next phase of growth with an acceleration in pace in the offshore and international markets that was very visible in the third quarter.*  \\n(source: transcript, linked

lowered break even prices for producers on a sustainable basis.  really a huge positive in my opinion.  $slb's q3 eps was the highest it's been since q4 2015.\\n\\ncffo = $1.6b; fcf = $1.1b; expecting

of the sakhalin-1 oil and gas project and has asked japanese consortium members to stay to ensure the country's energy security, the industry minister said on tuesday.\\n\\n&gt;\"the sakhalin-1 is extremely important for japan's energy security as it is a valuable source outside of the middle east,\" industry minister yasutoshi nishimura told a news conference, citing that japan was highly dependent on middle east crude oil.\\n\\n&gt;\"japanese government has decided to keep its stakes in the project,\" he said, adding he met executives of sakhalin oil and gas development co (sodeco), a consortium of japanese firms holding 30% stake in the formerly exxon-led project, on monday and urged them to consider joining the new russian entity.\\n\\n&gt;russian president vladimir putin last month issued a decree to establish a new operator for the formerly exxon mobil-led project, authorising the kremlin to decide whether foreign shareholders could retain stakes in sakhalin-1. exxon (xom.n) fully exited russia after moscow \"unilaterally terminated\" its interests in the project.   \n",
