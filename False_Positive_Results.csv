with a case of liquor. we were now to be known as the ""hatchet men"" and our patrols would
be known as ""hatchet teams"" and our company sign was changed to show two crossed hatchets. we didn't want the hatchets, as we had no use for them and we had enough to carry on our backs without another three pounds, but we had no choice in the matter. when the hatchets arrived, and were passed out to us, the handles were white, and we were instructed to paint them black, so they would not stand out in the bush. i was in charge of the detail for my platoon to paint the handles black and have supplied a photo showing them drying after being painted. with our new hatchets, we were deployed to the michelin rubber plantation. our three company platoons were traveling in file on a narrow plantation road, 3rd platoon on point, 1st platoon following and 2nd platoon last. suddenly gunfire erupted from in front of us, 3rd platoon. on point, had been ambushed. word was quickly passed to us, 1st platoon to go forward and engage the enemy and assist 3rd platoon which we did. the gunfight lasted about an hour with the vc withdrawing, leaving behind some dead and wounded. we were dispersed in the brush along the road side and one of the 3rd platoon troopers, who i shall not name, came across a wounded vc and with the assistance of some others managed to hold him down and he then proceeded to whack his head off with his new hatchet. the trooper proceeded to the road, very proud of his trophy and held it above his head as proof that he had killed the first vc with a hatchet and that his squad would claim the case of liquor that ""gunfighter"" emerson had promised. a reporter from life magazine was attached to us at the time and he took a picture of the trooper displaying the head, i believe that his name was malcolm brown. shortly thereafter the picture appeared on the cover of the dec. 65 issue of life magazine in the u.s. word very quickly came down to get rid of the hatchets and anyone caught with one would be brought up on charges of ""brutality‚Äù needless to say, ""gunfighter"" did not refund us our three dollars each for the hatchets that he had forced us to buy from him. the trooper that had taken the head was later kia. our co. commander was cpt. thomas taylor, son of gen. maxwell taylor.

1642024789,"in 1922, the russian civil war is finally drawing to a close.  
  
after the assassination by bombing of vladimir lenin (along with several other nearby victims, including one v.n. lvov), commander-in-chief lavr kornilov was invited to assume control of the provisional government from aleksandr kerensky after the latter‚Äôs devastating collapse of support. kornilov was very clearly a right-wing figure, and his ascension to what was a dictatorship in all but name made the socialists increasingly uneasy.  
  
without lenin to throw them in one direction or the other, the soviet dithered back and forth on what action to take. in the meantime, kornilov restored general brusilov to command of the front, and rolled back many of the actions taken by order number one. mutinies and unrest were put down by a twofold action: the first was the death sentence for desertion, and brutal enforcement thereof by commissars chosen from the rear. the second was a promise of a small amount of land and a larger pension for those who continued to fight until the end, which kornilov claimed was in sight (this land would prove to come from the brutal ‚Äúrussification‚Äù of the western and southern territories).  
  
the soviet continued to debate, with leon trotsky becoming its unofficial leader, it still remained divided on the nature of the war, and many feared starting a civil war would destroy russia by giving the germans an opening. when the great war ended in 1918, the public‚Äôs view had radically changed on the socialists. their continuous delay in defending what they had fought for (order #1 and a socialist government), and the resounding success that remaining in the war had brought kornilov and the territory of russia, had left the socialist parties far weaker than they had been at the time of the february revolution.  
  
the socialists realized now would be their last chance to stop kornilov, while they still had any support at all, and they declared a full state of war, seizing control of moscow and laying siege to st. petersburg. several national groups also declared their independence at this time. in particular, the poles demanded total control of the prusso-polish commonwealth (much to the prussians‚Äô terror) and land from western russia, and the ukrainians and finns demanded their independence.  
  
while things were initially anyone‚Äôs game, volunteer forces from the allies began arriving in russia, and the socialists found themselves more short-handed than they had expected. by the third year of the war, only saratov, viborg, and a region surrounding moscow remained in socialist hands, and the strongest rebel groups were surprisingly the caucasians, rather than either the poles or the ukrainians.  
  
moscow would fall to a triumphant kornilov on september 4th, 1922. the collapse of the socialists brought an official end to the war, though caucasian and central asian fighting would continue into mid 1923. with kornilov‚Äôs national paternalists now secure in their position, they could go forward with the reforms russia so desperately needed, and hopefully begin to look outward after a decade of conflict.",1.0,,BigDulles,0.0,False,False,True
1642098553,"while the number itself isn‚Äôt accurate, the ussr did carry out a massive campaign of violence against religious leaders in 1937-38 which killed or imprisoned the majority of those who had survived earlier, less systematic campaigns of violence. 

the exact reasons why 1937 was the year violence escalated so radically tie into the overall rationale behind the great terror‚Äôs turn toward mass violence. the outbreak of the spanish civil war heightened stalin‚Äôs fears of internal counterrevolution and disorder if war broke out. rising tensions with nazi germany and japan made that conflict appear imminent. nikolai yezhov, the chief of the nkvd from fall 1936 and a firm believer in major conspiracies, supported more serious measures against potential enemies. (1) ironically, this happened just a year after the newly crafted ‚Äústalin constitution‚Äù guaranteed freedom of worship and returned the right to vote to previously disenfranchised religious leader

throughout the spring-summer 1937, religious leaders and other ‚Äúsectarians‚Äù were identified as a serious threat to the regime, actively organizing conspiracies to undermine it. 

in the february-march 1937 plenum of the central committee, a number of speakers noted the risk of enemies of the people, naming specifically ‚Äúsectarians‚Äù, penetrating the lower rungs of soviet power by running in, disrupting, or otherwise interfering in the upcoming 1937 elections. (2) on march 27, an nkvd circular ordered the strengthening of investigative work against clergymen, emphasizing the need to protect upcoming elections and to destroy any and all anti-soviet religious organizations and practitioners. (3) the nkvd of ukraine issued materials on this topic in april related to regional ‚Äúsectarian‚Äù subversion. (4) across the board, regional party and nkvd leaders harped on religious leaders as counterrevolutionary masterminds. 

by the end of june 1937, the steady stream of materials on counterrevolutionary groups led stalin to order a final, decisive blow against all groups perceived to be enemies simultaneously. on july 2 all regional leaders were invited to submit lists of ‚Äúkulaks and criminals‚Äù from their respective territories, dividing them into categories to be shot or imprisoned 8-10 years. (5) the open-ended nature of this request invited a wide variety of clarifications and additions, including about religious leaders. many responses included requests to include clerics, mullahs, and other ‚Äúsectarians‚Äù in the compositions to be punished. (6)

because of this, nkvd operational order 0047 issued on july 30th after the collection of regional materials specifically mentioned religious leader multiple times, explicitly naming them as targets of the first of many ‚Äúmass operations‚Äù to begin in early august. per stalin‚Äôs instruction, all those arrested were to be ‚Äútried‚Äù by troikas in absentia, usually only with cursory review of their cases ‚Äì more often than not the troika simply signed off on ‚Äúalbums‚Äù of cases each day. (7)

in his september 8th report on the initial wave of arrests, yezhov included an entire section on religious ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù uncovered during the operation: (8)

&gt;church-sectarian counter-revolutionary underground

&gt;the presence of a broad church-sectarian insurgent underground, which is now being revealed, deserves serious attention. a large number of church-sectarian counter-revolutionary formations are being revealed in the western, gorky, moscow, sverdlovsk and other regions.

&gt;as the investigation establishes these formations, consisting of priests, sectarians, monastic elements, former kulaks and white guards, for many years conducted active insurrectionary work, organized former kulaks, created sabotage and wrecking groups from them on collective farms, prepared the commission of terrorist acts, carried out a wide counter-revolutionary propaganda and agitation.

&gt; in the western region, a large insurgent organization of baptist antiwar members was discovered, created by a sectarian preacher polufakin, associated with german intelligence. the organization had its branches in 10 districts of the region. in the case of this organization, 102 people were arrested.

&gt; in the gorky region, the church-monarchical organization of the former kulak of the monk savin is being liquidated. the organization covered several districts of the region and consisted of former kulaks, wandering priests, monks, ""wanderers"", etc. communication between the members of the organization was maintained through itinerant nuns. the organization conducted counterrevolutionary propaganda and agitation, distributed anti-soviet leaflets, worked on the preparation of terrorist acts and amassed insurgent cadres.

&gt; in the chelyabinsk region, in the course of the investigation into the cases of the arrested, an insurgent-terrorist organization of churchmen, representing a bloc of representatives of various religious movements, was uncovered. according to the testimony of the arrested bishop vyatkin, the organization has illegal rebel nests, with more than 300 members, in a number of districts of the region. the organization is headed by a rebel spiritual council headed by a priest, a former white officer bormotov. in the largest districts of the region there are district headquarters. the organization set itself the task of conducting sabotage work and organizing an uprising at the time of the outbreak of hostilities.

&gt; the organization was associated in moscow with metropolitans vitaliy and sergiy.

&gt; a church-sectarian insurgent organization of the same nature, uncovered in the syksunsky district of the sverdlovsk region, closed in its counterrevolutionary work with elements of the trotskyites and rights.
in general, yezhov‚Äôs report stressed the need for further arrests and investigation into all target groups, including religious officials. 

throughout fall 1937, stalin continued to emphasize to yezhov the importance of repressing religious leaders: (9)
&gt;comrade yezhov. it would be necessary to press the churchmen.

you're referring to *execution* of these people, the imprisoning their families and confiscation of their families possesions (i accept  that this would have amounted to very little in soviet russia, but that's not the relevant point).  i referred to the mistreatment of soviet pows post-war by the soviets themselves:

*'in 1945, about 100 filtration camps were set for repatriated ostarbeiter, pows, and other displaced persons, which processed more than 4,000,000 people. by 1946, 80% civilians and 20% of pows were freed, 5% of civilians, and 43% of pows were re-drafted, 10% of civilians and 22% of pows were sent to labor battalions, and 2% of civilians and 15% of the pows (226,127 out of 1,539,475 total) were transferred to the nkvd, i.e. the gulag'* \[source: (""–≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª"" (""military-historical magazine""), 1997, ‚Ññ5. page 32) and –∑–µ–º—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤.–Ω. –∫ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω. 1944‚Äì1951 –≥–æ–¥—ã // –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Å—Å—Å—Ä. 1990. ‚Ññ 4 (zemskov v.n. on repatriation of soviet citizens. istoriya sssr., 1990, no.4\]

1643472887,"in 1971 m. karunanidhi after completing one year in office begins to start working on what his predecessor c.n. annadurai planned on doing.

in september 1971 a board to plan the proceedings is formed under the chairmanship of periyar, the board consisted of ex prime ministers rajaji, v.n. neduncheyian, kamarajar and other prominent people like s. ramasamy and ex chief of army staff p.p. kumaramangalam.

this board had many deaths including the chairman periyar. finally in may of 1972 the board voted to rescue dravidian people stuck in bharat before, the rebellions begin. the navy begun preparations with chief of the naval staff oscar stanley dawson being ordered to start moving vessels to mangalore harbour. 

in july spies disguised as defectors from bharat, using their identity cards went to mumbai and began finding out dravidians there. they explained what was about to happen and what they are to do. the instructions given were to 

-speak to your neighbours about moving to another place within bharat.

-withdraw money slowly from their bank accounts.

-keep a radio provided by the dravidian government at all times

-pack only the bare essentials

almost every dravidian family is bombay decided to accept the offer. after the success of this the programme qas extended to other cities like prayagraj, pune, ashaval, meerut, cuttack and surat.

in september, the spies bribed some dockworkers in the harbour. the dravidian navy started buying tugboats to transport the people from bombay waters where after which they exit bombay waters they will board the dns madras, dns cochin and dns madura.

in october the families were readied to leave, in the early hours of the 4th of november the dravidian families in bandra, colaba and matunga were made to come to worli, from the jetty they boarded ferries and tugboats and ventured 4 kms into the sea where the dns cochin was waiting for them. they boarded the vessel and set sail for mangalore.

around 2500 people were rescued that day, it was kept under wraps so no one knows about it. they were temporarily placed in a housing complex in suburban mangalore until the operations ended. they were given free electricity, water and food. 25 schools and 10 colleges were established but not all fully functional yet. it would start operating as people are rescued.

**natalie mordovtseva** graduated from a couple of ukrainian academic programs, 2 degrees, one in journalism (2006), referring to her having studied journalism at v.n. karazin kharkiv national university and later, psychology at taras shevchenko national university of kyiv. 

she has appeared as an actress in various crime dramas on ukrainian television, some speaking ukrainian but also a couple in russian for russian tv network. i think her acting is pretty good in these. it isn‚Äôt over-the-top like we see her on this show. 

ukraine true crime movie *evidence* shows off her acting skills, and she seems to be playing a school teacher. in the clip, natalie‚Äôs character pleads for mercy from her husband, who appears to be infuriated at her for getting a secret note.

[in *agents of justice*, natalie‚Äôs character larisa gets interrogated about her dead husband, viktor.](https://www.reddit.com/link/lujyc7/video/k1yx2invv8k61/player)

[in 2018 show called *a story of a crime*,](https://www.reddit.com/link/lvt4z0/video/77nr6lxfejk61/player), her character elizavita visits the kyiv city cemetery. the purpose of her visit was a dead husband who she‚Äôd once threatened to kill. when accused of murdering her partner, natalie pulls out a gun from her purse and takes a few shots at a tree, which she misses, claiming she‚Äôs not the one who committed the crime


as for **yaraslava zaya**, she has appeared on several reality shows in ukraine, in 2014 (she was 19), she appeared on a reality show called *fashion to the people*. in the reality show, yara mentions how she‚Äôs a ‚Äúbig party girl‚Äù and loves nightclubs (just like jovi does). ‚Äúi also love rich men, foreigners probably,‚Äù yara declared, as a voiceover noted how her mother is a baker from zakarpattya and her father is a successful businessman from hungary. her parent‚Äôs divorce when she was little left her traumatized. yara had come to kyiv looking for love with foreigners. she said that she would marry a foreigner, as she considered them better and smarter than ukrainian men.

a year later, yara showed up on a dating show with a brand-new brunette look. the show wasn't so different from *90 day fianc√©*. in *love online*, yara, who seemed to have a different nose shape, was dating a russian guy named raphael, who was living in barcelona. cameras followed her as she flew to his city and spent three days with him. however, they broke up in the end. this show had mentioned how yara had worked as a waitress, seamstress, and administrator. she also talked about having had a nose job (which she now denies).",5.0,,hamimono,0.0,False,False,True

‚Äúof course, within the framework of a single article it is impossible to mention all the songs of those years. nonetheless, the provided materials convincingly testify to the fact that the songs of the patriotic war of 1812 are currently of interest to modern readers. however, in the best case scenario, they are familiar with them from reprints of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily from the collection ‚Äúfighting and folk songs of 1812‚Äì1815‚Äù (1877) and the anthology compiled by v.n. garteveld to commemorate the centenary of the patriotic war of 1812. in both works, the authors of the texts are not indicated.‚Äù

both give verbal nouns. in afb they are marked with the abbreviation *gr. ag.*.

i don‚Äôt mean that wiktionary is bad ‚Äì it has many excellent entries, it can be really good especially for etymology. but it depends on the specific entry, and sometimes you‚Äôll find nonsense there too. so never trust it entirely and cross-check it with other sources, just in case.

as for the verbs in question, it seems wiktionary is right (or at least not completely wrong).

both afb and colin mark give *gluasad* as v.n. of *gluais*, agreeing with wiktionary, but afb also gives another verb form *gluas* with verbal noun *gluasadh*.

both afb and colin mark give *beucaich* (agreeing with gaelicgrammar), but colin mark notes also alternative form *beucail*. afb also has entry for *beucadh* (even though it doesn‚Äôt give this form in the entry for the verb *beuc*) ‚Äì like in wiktionary.

so *beucadh* looks good too (it is regular enough, and there are also hits for it in [dasg corpas](https://dasg.ac.uk/corpus/) ‚Äì gaelic literary corpus) so it seems it is used too, even though not registered by colin mark.

1648760308,"target selection during the great terror has received a lot of attention over the past 20 years as large amounts of material has been released by the fsb‚Äôs central and regional archives, as well as the almost total declassification of police materials in ukraine and georgia. in the interest of simplicity, i‚Äôll focus on the ‚Äúkulak operation‚Äù, nkvd order no. 00447, which was launched in july-august 1937 against a wide variety of different targets across the country. 

in this operation regional departments of the nkvd (hereon written as unkvd) targeted ‚Äúkulaks‚Äù, criminals, and other enemies based on criteria handed down from moscow and categorized them as 1 (to be shot) or 2 (to be imprisoned) based on their ‚Äúdanger‚Äù to society. after a brief investigation, troikas composed of the unkvd chief, regional party leader, and procurator would sentence victims *in absentia* without trial, usually judging dozens or hundreds of cases at a time. 

from the start, the operation by design *regionalized* target selection, investigation, and sentencing, as had occurred with the first ‚Äúkulak operation‚Äù launched in early 1930 during collectivization. moscow gave the troikas final authority for sentencing without review or appeal, though it continued to give instructions on which population groups to focus on and which to exclude from troika judgments. 

because of the number of categories sent from moscow and their vagueness, the nkvd‚Äôs local departments chose targets based primarily on local needs and demographics. some districts focused on petty criminals, others individual farmers who hadn‚Äôt joined the collective farm, other industrial and defense enterprises, and others still local religious groups and their followers. the nkvd correctly interpreted the operation as a chance to conduct a broad social cleansing of all ‚Äúenemies‚Äù, resolving social and economic problems using mass repression. 

**laying the groundwork**

while the methodological/ideological origins of the ‚Äúkulak operation‚Äù began much earlier, its bureaucratic genesis started in summer 1937. on july 2, 1937, stalin sent a telegram to all regional party and unkvd leaders to compile lists of ""kulaks and criminals"", to be shot or exiled by troikas depending on how inveterately ""anti-soviet"" they were: (1)

&gt;it has been noticed that most of the former kulaks and criminals who were deported at one time from different regions to the northern and siberian regions, and then after the expiration of the expulsion period, returned to their regions, are the main instigators of all kinds of anti-soviet and sabotage crimes, both in collective farms and state farms, as well as in transport and in some areas of industry.

&gt;the central committee of the all-union communist party of bolsheviks invites all secretaries of regional and *krai* organizations and all regional, *krai* and republican representatives of the nkvd to register all kulaks and criminals who have returned to their homeland so that the most hostile of them are immediately arrested and shot in the order of administrative procedure of their cases through troikas, and the rest of the less active, but still hostile elements would be exiled at the direction of the nkvd.

&gt;the central committee of the all-union communist party of bolsheviks proposes to submit to the central committee within five days the composition of the troikas, as well as the number of those to be shot, as well as the number of those to be deported. 

yezhov, people's commissar for internal affairs, sent out his own telegram the following day directing regional nkvd leaders to: (2)

&gt;upon receipt of this, take into account all the kulaks and criminals who have settled in your region, who returned after serving their sentences and fled from the camps and exile.

further on, he ordered all kulaks and criminals be categorized in the same manner as stalin's telegram directed. data collection was supposed to be completed by july 8th. 

the telegram immediately received a variety of responses asking that the upcoming repressions be extended to different target groups which were nearly always approved. for example: (3)

&gt;agree with the proposal of the central committee of turkmenistan to include repression and expulsion of members of the [nationalist counterrevolutionary] organizations ""turkmen - azatlygi"", muslim clergy, etc., instructing the nkvd to determine the number to be shot and deported.

other approved requests included adding harvest-related sabotage and espionage, gulag inmates, various ‚Äúcounterrevolutionary and insurgent organizations‚Äù and families of gang members, immigrants from the western border regions, lamas and other minority religious leaders, and many other categories. (4)

requests to give the unkvd extensions on the due date for numbers to be repressed in order to collect more data were also received and approved. (5) leplevsky, people‚Äôs commissar of internal affairs for ukraine, noted in his summary of data from july 10th (2 days late already) that the donbas and dnepropetrovsk regions‚Äô numbers of kulaks and criminals to be sentenced were incomplete and would be updated. (6)

on july 16th, the nkvd held a conference in moscow at which the parameters of the operation were discussed. regional unkvd leaders were invited to discuss problems in their areas of responsibility and present plans for the upcoming conduct of the operation. (7) the nkvd of ukraine, for example, attended the meeting with the following points of clarification: (8)

&gt;1) families of kulaks and criminals of the 1st and 2nd category.

&gt;2) should the troikas judge all those arrested in categories 1 and 2.

&gt;3) on the procedure for filing cases (in the usual manner, with the sanction of the prosecutor).

&gt;4) on the order of dispatch (in general trains, in prison cars, according to the orders of the gulag, from prisons).

&gt;5) if the family is exiled, then at the same time and in the same direction as the head of the family?

&gt;6) what is the minimum property families can take with them if they are deported?

&gt;7) how to [deal] with families that include military personnel and law enforcement?

&gt;8) whether persons with obvious signs of disability are included in the second category.

&gt;9) should kulaks who at one time evaded exile be included?

&gt;10) how to [deal with] priests who have returned from exile and are demontsrating counterrevolutionary activity.

no minutes of this meeting have been found, but testimony from participants as well as what was repeated in subsequent meetings between unkvd leaders and their own subordinates in late july and early august suggests a broad outline. along with presentation of operational plans and clarification of key questions, which outlined the procedure for the operation, yezhov likely also approved the use of torture at the conference. regional meetings of the unkvd over the following weeks repeated that physical coercion was sanctioned. (9)

again quoting leplevsky, local nkvd leaders were expected to have complete data of target groups brought to moscow by this point: (10)

&gt; you must arrive in moscow for the meeting by 7/16, having the plan of operation and all accounting materials in your hands.

however, as the operational plan for ukraine drawn up before the conference notes, full accounting of all targets was still incomplete. it also provides a useful window into how initial targets were determined: (11)

&gt;when preparing an operation against kulaks and criminals, widely use materials on kulaks, members of various religious sects, contacts of foreign consulates, persons sued for espionage, recipients of ""hitler aid"" [nazi food aid to ethnic german farmers in the ussr during the 1931-33 famine], former political bandits.

thus, for the first wave of arrests, the unkvd intended to use their existing card catalogue of enemies to carry out mass arrests of those they already had registered. this is confirmed by materials from other regions, discussed later.

1648760499,"u/arrogant_ambassador similar directives continued to appear throughout the month of august to push the ukrainian nkvd (and presumably, other unkvd) in the direction preferred by moscow. at the end of the month, additional criticism was sent to all unkvd about the lack of reports on group cases and uncovered conspiracies, as well as demands for concrete reports about how the operation‚Äôs arrests had reduced ‚Äúnegative manifestations‚Äù in the economy and society (industrial and agricultural accidents, opposition to the soviet government, etc.). (16) as most unkvd (with some regional exceptions, such as kharkiv) had pursued individual rather than group cases using their own materials, the demand for reports on group cases was a push towards expanding the scope of repression to ‚Äúuncover‚Äù new enemies. (17)

as noted in leplevsky‚Äôs circular and subsequent documents, moscow took a keen interest in trying to control target selection and ensuring the unkvd used the troikas appropriately, with mixed success as ukraine‚Äôs example shows. at the same time, it‚Äôs clear that moscow‚Äôs ‚Äúguidance‚Äù encouraged the unkvd to show some discrimination when choosing who to arrest, as well as which categories they should be assigned to. 

in the shugurovsky district of the tatar assr, for example, we have a list of 35 ‚Äúkulaks and criminals who returned from exile and detention, first category‚Äù from the local nkvd department. all of them were from just 6 villages, and only two were identified as exiled or having fled to avoid exile in the early 1930s ‚Äì another 4 were identified as ‚Äúsocially harmful‚Äù. 14 had minor criminal records for theft and hooliganism, while 16 had no indication of ‚Äúanti-soviet activities‚Äù beyond their background (individual farmers, family of kulaks or merchants, etc.). none fit the definitions established by moscow for immediate repression. (18)

despite being identified as those to be repressed in the first category (re: shot immediately as serious threats), none of those listed were punished via troikas under order 00447. one was arrested in december and convicted via the court system. at least in the initial stages of the ‚Äúkulak operation‚Äù, those who did not fit the characteristic dictated by moscow in the tatar assr were weeded out.  the chistopol operational group followed a similar process, identifying 600 names to be convicted in the second category by july 28th but weeding out 408 of those by august 13th. (19)

one thing that should become clear is the obvious contradictory impulses encouraged by the central nkvd‚Äôs directive. each region was expected to convict ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù targets via the troikas, use effective tactics to expose enemies (undercover work, informants, surveillance, etc.), and give moscow detailed information about its work. yet constant demands to target a wider array of groups, preference for group cases by the central nkvd (which had a much lower evidentiary standard), and the large number of arrests and convictions expected all pushed the unkvd toward indiscriminate mass repression. 

there has been some academic debate over whether the intent of stalin was to make the ‚Äúlimits‚Äù a maximum or a minimum for each region. the documents of the 8th (statistical) department of the gugb seem to interpret them as minimum goals to be achieved: (20)

&gt;as can be seen from these data, the troikas under the nkvd work most intensively in the kiev, odessa and vinnitsa regions. in the kiev and vinnitsa regions, the number of convicts in category 1 is approaching the established limit, in the odessa region it even exceeds the limit. in kiev and odessa regions, the number of convicts in the 2nd category is also the largest.

&gt;the troikas under the nkvd for the kharkiv region and the nkvd massr are lagging behind - those convicted in category 1 do not even make up 50% of the limit, while the number of those convicted in category 2 is generally insignificant.

with mass arrests of party and nkvd leaders ongoing, the push to fulfill (and overfulfill) the numbers assigned by moscow was a matter of life and death. 

along with directives on the conduct of the operation which influenced target selection, the central leadership also issued a number of circulars emphasizing particular target groups to be dealt with. 

on august 7, 1937, an nkvd circular provided additional clarification about which criminal elements should be prosecuted: (21)

&gt;(1) criminals who committed armed and violent robbery;

&gt;(2) repeat offenders who were prosecuted for stealing livestock, street robbery, drunkards and harboring criminals, as well as keepers of brothels;

&gt;(3) recidivists and criminals who escaped from places of detention;

&gt;(4) recidivists and criminals without a fixed place of residence, evading socially useful labor, who, although not accused of a specific crime, still maintain ties with the criminal subculture. 

operations against minor criminals, under the broad rubric of ""socially dangerous elements"", were integral to the general social cleansing order 00447 was to carry out. evidence has shown that throughout the 1930s the division between ""political"" and ""non-political"" crimes significantly blurred, especially as in 1930 the criminal police had been completely subordinated to the political police. 

while the norm was to obtain confessions in cases before conviction, this doesn‚Äôt seem to have been a set rule for every province. in kalinin province and the moldovan assr, for example, over 90% of cases did not include any confession of guilt. nor was it a requirement in other regions ‚Äì individuals were regularly convicted based solely on their social background/recidivism or, in group cases, association with other individuals who had confessed (and often, were forced to accuse others as well). the inter-district operational groups worked extensively with party leaders, employers, and ‚Äúcharacter witnesses‚Äù (professional witnesses under the nkvd‚Äôs employ) who would sign accusations against lists of targets and point out targets (bad workers, critics, etc.) for the nkvd to add. (22)

**implementation**

for each target of order 00447, their experience depended both on the guidance discussed above as well as the specific regional characteristics. 

in altai krai, many of those targeted were individual farmers who had refused to join the collective farm. repression combined with other measures (higher taxes, land restrictions, etc.) was used to eliminate the individual sector entirely. in several district in october-november 1937, the collective farms which had seen the slowest progress in gathering the harvest and meeting their procurement quotas were the main targets of repression, with targets chosen within those farms based on their social background. repression was specifically targeted to resolve immediate economic and social problems, terrorizing peasants into joining the collective farm and meeting their procurement quotas. (23)

the exhaustion of the initial contingents under surveillance during the first month of the operation and the push by the center to ‚Äúuncover‚Äù new enemies led to the increased falsification of data by the unkvd in order to secure convictions. in altai, 24% of troika convictions in august for ‚Äúformer kulaks‚Äù were for individuals who were in fact not kulaks at all. this rose to 30% in october-november and 70% by march 1938. usually they were classified as ‚Äúhidden kulaks‚Äù or ‚Äúuncovered kulaks‚Äù when, by all accounts, they had only ever been poor or middle farmers who in some way offended the local authorities. the highest proportions of falsifications occurred near the planned ‚Äúend‚Äù of the operation when limits remained unfulfilled (in december-january and march).

1649822566,"&gt;still russia has about 400 modern tanks (t-90s) and about 2,500 slightly older models (t-72/80s). with reserves it's over 10k but that would be a lot of losses from those javelins.

the t-80 is more modern than the t-90, but it cost too much and used a gas turbine instead of diesel. and we all know russia's fuel issues. the t-90 is a redesignated t-72 with some of the t-80's tech. i mean it's literally the same exact tank as a t-72 with an extra layer of modernized equipment. the us destroyed so many t-72's in iraq that russia changed it to the t-90 to remove that stigma in the export market.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-90)

&gt;the t-90 has its origins in a soviet-era program aimed at developing a single replacement for the t-64, t-72 and t-80 series of main battle tanks. **the t-72 platform was selected as the basis** for the new generation of tank owing to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and automotive qualities. the kartsev-venediktov design bureau from nizhny tagil was responsible for the design work and prepared two parallel proposals‚Äî**the object 188, which was a relatively simple upgrade of the existing t-72b tank (object 184)...**  
&gt;  
&gt;the object 188 was engineered by a team under v.n. venediktov. the biggest change was the integration of the 1a45 fire-control system of the t-80u. **the object 188 was initially designated as the t-72bm.**  
&gt;  
&gt;the principal upgrade in the t-90 is the incorporation of a slightly modified form of the t-80u's more sophisticated 1a45t irtysh fire control system and an upgraded v-84ms multi-fuel engine developing 830 hp (620 kw).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-80)

&gt;the t-80 performed so poorly in the first chechen war that general-lieutenant aleksandr galkin, the head of the armour directorate, convinced the minister of defence after the conflict **to never again procure tanks with gas turbine engines** \[37\] (galkin reversed his position in 1996, **claiming that the t-80u was superior to the t-90**).",3.0,,DrJohanzaKafuhu,0.0,False,False,True

1649934216,"&gt;the soviet premise is wrong, the soviet union merely co opted the name, they were in charge and did more than ""let them do their own thing"" at least by definitional standards.

false. when soviet troops entered pyongyang on 24 august 1945, they found a local people's committee established there, led by veteran christian nationalist cho man-sik. unlike their american counterparts, the soviet authorities recognized and worked with the people's committees.

this according to: robinson, michael e (2007). korea's twentieth-century odyssey, pages 105-107 and cumings, bruce (2005). korea's place in the sun: a modern history. pg. 227-228.


&gt;he was a prk leader when the soviets entered, but the soviets didn't like didnt like him or his party leanings so they installed a former korean who fought with the soviets. 

i mean this isn't really true. since cho-man sik was initially favoured by the ussr when they first entered. but also, you're now discussing the dprk and its leadership.

&gt;so its tough to claim the soviets occupied the north ""but let them do their own thing.""

it really isn't. because that is exactly what they did. the furtre of the prk changed when it was dissolved by the americans in the south. so it's only natural that there were changes in leadership. but the structure of the government, the people's councils, stayed in tact and were incorporated into the future dprk.

&gt;see, i can make absurdly pointless comments too.

the ""too"" there implies i said anything absured or pointless. let me repeat myself, if the usa didn't occupy southern korea and then dissolve the popular prk, there wouldn't be a war. because there'd be a unified korea. 
not dissolving the prk is a good thing, isn't the thing i thought you'd take issue with tbh.

&gt;im not aware of any credible academic at all who puts the korean war on one certain thing, especially on the usa.

then maybe it's time that they started to do that. again, the root cause of the conflict came from the usa dissolving the prk because it was socialist. 
there would not be much of a division of korea had this not happened, especially since the soviets were very hands off while the prk.

&gt;syngman rhee was not peacefully inclined, but the dprk ultimately started the korean war we got. 

maybe then, rhee should not have occupied and bombed the city of haeju. the korean attack on the south on 25 june 1950 was a response to a two-day long bombing by the south koreans and their surprise attacks on haeju and other places. early in the morning of 25 june, before the dawn counterattack in the north korean account, the south korean office of public information announced that the southern forces had captured haeju

&gt;tens of millions of south koreans flourishing in their society are certainly happy they were not unified into the bleak, tyrannical, and somewhat theocratic eerie regime of north korea.


""flourishing""

all i'm saying is, if birth rates are projected to become negative in the near future because life and debt are so expensive that having children is a joke of an idea, maybe that's not flourishing.

&gt;you are allowing a certain occasion where the u.s killed south korean civilians, and now saying that we can put the hundreds of thousands of deaths of south koreans citizens on the u.s?

yes.

i used no-gun ri as an example, of one event where the south korean casualties could be pinned on the usa. another example is bodo league, where the usa supported and was complicit, if not outright involved, the execution of up to 200,000 people. 

&gt;i was being generous in my earlier comment by saying that 1.5 million north korean civilians died

the newly discovered census figures add important information to russian reports on the war recently published by south korea's ministry of national defense. according to chosun ilbo (seoul, 25 june 2001), four volumes of reports by soviet ambassador and chief military adviser to the dprk, lt.-gen. v.n.razuvaev, compiled by the ministry's institute of military history, cite a total of 1.2 million civilian casualties for north korea, which include 282,000 killed in bombing raids and 796,000 fled to the south or missing. **the remaining 800,000 population loss therefore represents the total deaths from combat and natural causes.**
so at the very least that is 1.1 million deaths, since it refers tto deaths from combat and natural causes. not just injury, which goes unmentioned in this report.

furthermore, according to guenter  lewy in ""america in vietnam"". pp. 450‚Äì453: ""estimates of communist troops killed are about one-half million. the total number of korean civilians who died in the fighting, which left almost every major city in north and south korea in ruins, has been estimated at between 2 and 3 million.""

this is to say nothing of how in 2018 after the release of a suppressed isc (international scientific commission) report, and the release of declassified cia communications daily reports in 2020, it was revealed that the us used [germ warfare](https://jeff-kaye.medium.com/a-real-flood-of-bacteria-and-germs-communications-intelligence-and-charges-of-u-s-4decafdc762) in the korean war. [many of these attacks involved the dropping of insects or small mammals infected with viruses such as anthrax, plague, cholera, and encephalitis.](https://jeff-kaye.medium.com/a-concealed-war-crime-u-s-anthrax-bombings-of-china-during-the-korean-war-14782ceb40a9).


&gt;""senior indonesian officials have taken part in an unprecedented meeting to discuss the killing of 500,000 communists and their supporters during an insurgency 50 years ago.""

this is a very stupid piece of evidence. in the same vein as ""i investigated myself and found i did nothing wrong.""

whereas other sources, such as: https://www.routledge.com/the-army-and-the-indonesian-genocide-mechanics-of-mass-murder/melvin/p/book/9781138574694

say things like: ""for the past half century, the indonesian military has depicted the 1965-66 killings, which resulted in the murder of approximately one million unarmed civilians, as the outcome of a spontaneous uprising. this formulation not only denied military agency behind the killings, it also denied that the killings could ever be understood as a centralised, nation-wide campaign.""

&gt;regarding the russian famine. 

what??? where in that reply did i say anything about the famine??? why are you back-pedalling back to this???

&gt;led by joseph stalin, the soviet union wanted to punish germany economically, forcing the country to pay war reparations and contribute its industrial technology to help postwar soviet recovery. 

it would have been easier for you to just link the article you copy-pasted this from. 

at any rate, your argument is kinda undermined by:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalin_note

furthermore, none of this changes the fact that the usa still violated pretty much every agreement made with the ussr on germany. they created a new currency, they combined all other occupation zones into one and a new economic zone with it. among other things &gt;_&gt;

had the us abided by these agreements, perhaps the whole blockade and airlift could have been avoided. given that there had already been news of an ""operation unthinkable"" in the ussr, that they would see an attempt to unify germany under squarely western influence as a precursor to an attack.

i'm not sure i understand where you're getting your ""misleading"" idea from, but those (as well as many others, again) not only agree on sperm + egg = human being, but explicitly that pre-embryonic organisms being such is no longer supported scientifically. this is where the ""so masturbation must be genocide"" gimmick loses scientific backing, as well as your bit about sperm and eggs separately being equal to zygotes.   


&gt;the discussion is absolutely one of morality/religion, where the scientific basis is simply to justify a certain viewpoint or opinion.

1651787783,"&gt; oh no, the word human has multiple definitions so my philosophy is invalid????? this is meaningless gibberish. this is logic to you? lmao. 

nearly your entire argument at this point is that there are multiple definitions of words. no reconciliation with the fact that your contrived philosophy enables biological human beings to be killed.

the remainder of your argument is to complain about me being emotional, when i haven't been. i'd suggest actually forming an argument about why you believe it's acceptable to kill this particular group of humans.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;&gt; we shouldn't let our emotions get in the way of the biology.

&gt; then stop doing so. you can join the discussion at any time.

i suggest you take your own advice.

1651798904,"&gt; you've just quibbled with semantics and placed a completely arbitrary moral weight on the word ""organism"" that you haven't actually bothered to substantiate in any way. as of now, you've given me zero percent more reason to care about an organism right now than an ova or a flea (the latter of which is also, btw, an organism).

i don't need to convince you. by the way, you've also failed to convince me that we should be able to kill newborn babies up until they reach consciousness.

&gt; yes? life is pretty harsh; thanks for contributing to my point.

...you didn't make a point, you just expressed concern that death exists, which i also agree is pointless in this debate.

&gt; a fetus isn't a person. 

a human fetus is a human organism, and human organisms are called humans, human beings, and people.

the entirety of the rest of your argument can be refuted by the fact that human zygotes/embryos/fetuses are human organisms, not just organisms. fleas are irrelevant. you are trying to form a philosophical/moral position that excludes certain human beings from being ""people,"" specifically for the purpose of being able to kill them. this unscientific strategy is noise.

con¬∑cep¬∑tion 1. the action of conceiving a child or of a child being conceived.
synonyms inception of pregnancy, conceiving, fertilization, impregnation, insemination; rarefecundation

these are the facts, as is the  fact that at approximately 1.5-2 hours after conception that zygote becomes a living organism that is scientifically classified as h-sapiens. 

every embryology textbook; bar none, agrees that a new human life is created at conception. 

human life begins at fertilization
the following references illustrate the fact that a new human embryo, the starting point for a human life, comes into existence with the formation of the one-celled zygote:

i do want to make it clear, however, that when you say that the zygote being the first stage of human life is ""flatly wrong"", or ""evidently false in some cases"" (which implies it's true in others, which is a weird claim to make), or that ""conception is not the ""obvious"" initial developmental stage to associate with an individual human"" you are going against the establishment scientific position. if you or anyone else says a zygote is not a human life you're making a claim similar in kind to saying that the earth is 12,000 years old: you can find scientists who will agree with you, but you're clearly going against the scientific consensus.

some receipts on that:

the [encyclopedia britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/zygote) says the following: ""the zygote represents the first stage in the development of a genetically unique organism.""

the textbook [concepts of biology](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/24-6-fertilization-and-early-embryonic-development/) states that ""the development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the blastula."" as does the textbook [the developing human](https://eu-ireland-custom-media-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ukmeaeu/esample/9780323611541-sample-chapter.pdf) which states ""human development is a continuous process that begins when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (spermatozoon) from a male to form a single-celled zygote."" [*human biology*](https://bio.libretexts.org/bookshelves/human_biology/book%3a_human_biology_(wakim_and_grewal)/23%3a_human_growth_and_development/23.2%3a_germinal_stage) states that ""the germinal stage of development is the first and shortest of the stages of the human lifespan. the germinal stage lasts a total of eight to nine days. it begins in a fallopian tube when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm to form a zygote (day 0)."" those were just the textbooks that are available online and could be googled in 10 minutes, but you can find the same fact stated in just about all textbooks on biological human development. if you can find a textbook that says otherwise, please provide a source.

columbia university [defines](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/humandev/2004/introduction.pdf) a zygote as ""a diploid cell resulting from fertilization of an ovum (mature female germ cell) by asperm. a zygote is the beginning of a new human being.""

and here's a [pile of quotes](https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html) saying the same thing:

now you are free to ask why this is relevant to the larger abortion debate. perhaps it is irrelevant. but it is relevant to the question of whether the zygote, the embryo, or the fetus is human. it unquestionably is. to say otherwise is to make a claim akin to flat-earthism. if that fact is irrelevant to the larger debate (which it very well may be!) then why are you fighting so hard against it? why not just admit the fact that abortion ends a human life and then make the very reasonable argument that it's not a meaningful human life, or that it's a human life that lacks the qualities we value, that it's not a person, heck even that it's not a citizen! why continue to make preposterous claims about human development?",2.0,,FlyingLionWithABook,0.0,False,False,True

1652827859,"for several years now, from her cramped alliance office with a bit of roller derby memorabilia on a shelf above her computer, mazel-carlton has been a leader in running hearing voices network groups and training others to do the same around the country, from augusta, maine, to eureka, calif. h.v.n. originated in the mid-‚Äô80s after a dutch psychiatrist, marius romme, worked with a client, patsy hage, who was hallucinating and suicidal. hage insisted that romme pay attention to the content of her voices instead of dismissing what they said as meaningless. romme went on to study hundreds of people like hage, and in a 1989 paper in schizophrenia bulletin, he argued that practitioners should ‚Äúaccept the patient‚Äôs experience of the voices‚Äù; that ‚Äúbiological psychiatry‚Äù may not be ‚Äúvery helpful in coping with the voices because it, too, places the phenomenon beyond one‚Äôs grasp‚Äù; that practitioners should ‚Äústimulate the patient to meet other people with similar experiences‚Äù; and that patients benefited when they could ‚Äúattribute some meaning to the voices.‚Äù romme‚Äôs paper was mostly ignored, but hearing voices support groups cropped up, especially in britain and across europe. in the united states, it took much longer; some of the first were started by the alliance around 2008, four years before mazel-carlton began working there.  
  
for mazel-carlton, one of the groups‚Äô most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality. unlike on a psych ward or in many a psychiatrist‚Äôs office, unusual beliefs are not monitored, corrected, constrained. mazel-carlton‚Äôs motto is, ‚Äúif i‚Äôm controlling, i‚Äôm not connecting‚Äù ‚Äî and connection, for her, is everything. it defines hope.  
  
ideally the groups meet in person, but with the pandemic, the movement has turned to zoom, and one day in march, i joined a virtual group that mazel-carlton helps to conduct. the session drew seven people spanning from north carolina to washington state. this particular group focuses on the spiritual, a common theme for people with voices and visions. at the outset, mazel-carlton invited everyone to open up by reminding: ‚Äúthis is where i can go if i have direct experiences of the divine. it‚Äôs a place i can go, if i‚Äôm someone with a psychiatric label, to talk about spirituality without having my experience pathologized. we validate one another here.‚Äù

a man described being rocked and comforted by ‚Äúan upside-down angel‚Äù when he was growing up. mazel-carlton modeled an h.v.n. principle that prizes curiosity about other realities by asking the man for more about his experience. in reply to another participant, she said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm so sorry that people are refusing to honor your soul‚Äôs identity.‚Äù then a woman talked about visiting her grandmother in a nursing home during covid and seeing her grandmother‚Äôs ‚Äúglowing pink orb rising from her chest‚Äù and everything as ‚Äúsparkling and glowing and timeless.‚Äù  
  
the woman said, ‚Äúeverything was connected; there was this pulse, this flow‚Äù ‚Äî and there was a fight with a nurse when the woman, feeling that she was god, took off her mask. a psychiatrist labeled her psychotic, ‚Äúso i couldn‚Äôt keep telling him my experiences, because he was telling me i‚Äôm sick, and i‚Äôm not sick.‚Äù in this, according to the mainstream view, she was confirming her illness; denial of one‚Äôs diagnosis, termed anosognosia, is seen as a glaring symptom of psychotic disorder.  
  
‚Äúthe first time i came to this group,‚Äù the woman went on, ‚Äúand said something about what happened that day with my grandma, i looked at the screen and people were nodding their heads, and i thought, holy \[expletive\], people get what i‚Äôm talking about. and when people talked about feeling like they‚Äôre jesus christ, i was like, oh, my god, i‚Äôm not the only one? in group, i don‚Äôt feel alone, and feeling alone is like something crushing my chest.‚Äù she began to cry minimally. ‚Äúgroup is a place to be vulnerable,‚Äù she said. ‚Äúin my everyday life, i don‚Äôt feel safe. i have to put on my armor.‚Äù  
  
on a wall next to mazel-carlton‚Äôs desk, there‚Äôs a map of the united states dotted with colored pins. blue pins mark places where she and alliance colleagues have led or arranged for an h.v.n. facilitator training. ‚Äúi sometimes feel like a general mapping the revolution,‚Äù she said. through her zeal, the network had grown from a handful of u.s. groups to 120, though after two years of the pandemic, the number is closer to 100. zoom sessions can‚Äôt match the reassurance and resonance of in-person gatherings.  
  
on the map, red pins represent another campaign. they stand for cities and towns where mazel-carlton and the alliance have conducted trainings in their approach to suicide prevention. the workshops are for prospective founders of support groups ‚Äî and within the groups, as at h.v.n. meetings, clinicians tend to be barred from the room ‚Äî but they are also for practitioners and family members who want a new way to talk with those contemplating suicide.  
  
a slide within the training protocol mazel-carlton has designed teaches that the mission is ‚Äúto stay present‚Äù and not ‚Äúto prevent them from doing that.‚Äù ‚Äústay away from fix-it mode, from savior mode,‚Äù mazel-carlton tells trainees. ‚Äúwith our capes on, we can‚Äôt listen.‚Äù a first principle is that people must be allowed to talk freely about all that is preying on them, including the wish to take their own lives, and in the groups, a foundational pact is that no one will be reported, not to any hotline, not to the police or any practitioner, no matter what he or she expresses an intent to do. to comprehend how thoroughly this defies dominant practice, take the policy of the country‚Äôs most-called ‚Äî and heavily federally funded ‚Äî suicide hotline. it advertises confidentiality but covertly scores risk and, each year, without permission, dispatches police cars and ambulances to the doors of thousands. from hotline to psych hospital, the focus is on risk management. it is on exerting control. by contrast, the core idea of the alliance‚Äôs program is that as long as you are talking about killing yourself, and feel you are being listened to and understood, you are much less prone to end your life. there‚Äôs little research that assesses these approaches or compares them. a 2020 study in the journal suicide and life-threatening behavior links a person‚Äôs perception of being coercively hospitalized with an increased risk of attempted suicide after hospitalization; there is little research that looks at the approach favored by the alliance.  
  
under mazel-carlton, the groups have grown to almost 30 from three, from boston to denver, despite the obstacles of the pandemic. at least as important, countless u.s. practitioners have learned new ways to listen to the desperate. and a brazilian mental-health organization, cenat, has brought mazel-carlton to that country, where she has spoken on suicide to clinicians, along with clergy, law enforcement and the diagnosed in s√£o paulo, vit√≥ria and salvador. mercycare, an australian community-services nonprofit, has flown her in to speak in sydney, melbourne and perth. over the past two years, in the united states, she has given dozens of talks on suicide and the hearing voices movement to audiences of several hundred at conferences, to social-work graduate students, to staff at psych hospitals on grand rounds. in early may, she was in indianapolis, teaching a roomful of clinicians not far from her childhood home.

1652827962,"chacku mathai, whose indian family immigrated to the united states when he was a child, works as a project director with a large new york state-funded program, ontrackny, which combines an emphasis on medication with the inclusion of client perspectives about their care. and he facilitates hearing voices groups. during one of our many conversations, mathai told me a parable about a traveler in a foreign land coming across a bird he has never seen before, a peacock. thinking that such a freakish creature will never survive, the traveler cuts off its feathers to correct nature‚Äôs error.  
  
mathai, who hears voices and has visions and was hospitalized after a suicide attempt as a teenager, is something like the peacock, except that he rejects medication that would shear away his difference. by immersing himself in yogic practices, he gives his mind a measure of rest. still, voices stalk him, suspicious of people and full of foreboding. sometimes, he told me, he thinks about whether, if the perfect antipsychotic existed, he would take it. ‚Äúmy experience is so rich,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúi wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything.‚Äù he spoke of having a keen empathy for the singularity and solitude of others, a sensitivity that can bring a feeling of being universally joined.  
  
beth, who asked that i use only her first name and who has led h.v.n. groups in western massachusetts, pointed out that though the hearing voices movement wrestles against conventional psychiatry, it isn‚Äôt anti-psychiatry. a former music teacher and cellist, beth used to take medications that left her with terrible tremors and a torturous physical restlessness called akathisia, deepening the agony of a teaching career lost to her struggles. but after an odyssey of working with inflexible psychiatrists, she found one willing to chart a path of mutual understanding and compromise. she continues to have unsettling visions, but a religious practice along with a calibrated mix of drugs helps somewhat to make her life more manageable while inflicting only mild tremors, and she is playing her cello for the first time in 20 years.

‚Äúbut i don‚Äôt know how to get him to understand that i‚Äôm on his side. he‚Äôs very turned off to the mental-health system. he told me i put him in the hospital. i said it wasn‚Äôt me, it was the psychiatrist. i know he‚Äôs going to do what he‚Äôs going to do, i know i can‚Äôt prevent it, but he says he was comfortable being homeless, because no one could tell him anything ‚Äî and now what if he becomes homeless again? he could be killed, god forbid.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi‚Äôm not putting this on you,‚Äù mazel-carlton said, ‚Äúbut it sounds like he‚Äôs had some institutional trauma. so what i might avoid is bringing things up from a mental-health lens.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi think about the m-word,‚Äù she said, talking about medication. ‚Äúbut i don‚Äôt say it.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi think that‚Äôs wise.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi can‚Äôt help it.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi think it‚Äôs good that you don‚Äôt go there,‚Äù mazel-carlton said. ‚Äúpharmaceuticals are easily accessible ‚Äî he knows that. he knows he can make that choice anytime. when a mom brings up medication, it can sound like, i don‚Äôt like the way you are. like, the way you are makes me uncomfortable.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi‚Äôm freaking out.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúas adults, the moments when we feel that our parents trust us ‚Äî that‚Äôs the lottery-like feeling,‚Äù mazel-carlton said.

&gt; the majority of abortions were elective (99.02%), with 1290.98%) cases reported as taking place for medical reasons.

if we extrapolate that to the roughly 700,000 abortions that annually occur nation-wide, that's about 7,000 abortions performed annually for medical reasons. further, i have yet to see a state banning abortions when the life of the mother is in danger.

&gt; childbirth is fourteen times more deadly than abortion.

childbirth is incredibly safe.

there were about [3,600,000 live births](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm) in the us in 2020, roughly [800,000 abortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_statistics_in_the_united_states), and roughly [875,000 miscarriages](https://www.livescience.com/50790-miscarriage-misconceptions.html), for an estimated total of 5,275,000 pregnancies. there were [861 maternal deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm) that same year.

this yields an overall pregnancy death rate of 0.016%. if every maternal death occurred during birth (they didn't), the maternal death rate due to childbirth would be 0.024%. [the death rate for symptomatic flu is around 0.11-0.12% typically](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html), or about 5 times higher.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the ‚Äú49 million deaths‚Äù you‚Äôre referring to weren‚Äôt actual people that ever existed, were they?

again, i never mentioned 49 million people, but zygotes on up through infants are, indeed, people. zygotes are organisms, and organisms that are members of homo sapiens are called human beings. human being are also called people, and denying ""personhood"" to certain humans because their deaths would be convenient is wildly shitty, but pushed by some people nevertheless.

definition of **negligent homicide**: ‚Äúnegligent homicide is a criminal charge brought against a person who, through criminal negligence, allows another person to die.‚Äù¬π

and in order to define negligent homicide, we must define criminal negligence. 

**criminal negligence** is defined as: ...‚Äúwhe[n] a person ignores an obvious risk or disregards the life and safety of those around him.‚Äù

i think the key phrase here is ‚Äúobvious risk.‚Äù you are correct that most women don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre pregnant at the literal moment of conception (which, by the way, *is* the moment life begins¬≥, according to science‚Å¥‚Äî assuming you prefer scientific facts). therefore, there is no ‚Äúobvious risk,‚Äù given that the woman may have very little indication that she is pregnant. early on, there is no way for her to know for sure that there is life inside her without taking a pregnancy test, which she doesn‚Äôt necessarily have cause to do if she doesn‚Äôt suspect she might be pregnant. therefore, there is no ‚Äúobvious risk‚Äù component, meaning she is not guilty of criminal negligence, and thus not guilty of negligent homicide.

now, you might be able to piece together some sort of argument out of this *if* the woman knows she is pregnant, but otherwise, the legality of the issue would not hold up for you in a court of law. it‚Äôs unlikely you could even make a case for civil negligence here. good try (really), and an interesting thought exercise, but i don‚Äôt think you could successfully convince anyone of this being a legitimate concern.

&gt; as a finished human, i do not get to control someone else's body, so why are we giving that right to unfinished humans?

if you consider infants to be ""finished humans,"" which they aren't, then yes, they do have the right to ""control someone else's body."" a mother does not have the right to forgo breastfeeding and let her child starve to death. the child's right to life supersedes her right to bodily autonomy.

""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients.

now you can say that it's a human life but not a person, and thus doesn't have rights. that's a sensible position, though one i disagree with. but to say it isn't a human life is just wrong as a matter of fact.

but don't take my word for it!

the [encyclopedia britannica](http://www.britannica.com/science/zygote) says the following: ""the zygote represents the first stage in the development of a genetically unique organism.""¬†

the textbook [concepts of biology](http://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/24-6-fertilization-and-early-embryonic-development/) states that ""the development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the blastula."" as does the textbook [the developing human](http://eu-ireland-custom-media-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ukmeaeu/esample/9780323611541-sample-chapter.pdf) which states ""human development is a continuous process that begins when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (spermatozoon) from a male to form a single-celled zygote.""

[human biology](https://bio.libretexts.org/bookshelves/human_biology/book%3a_human_biology_(wakim_and_grewal)/23%3a_human_growth_and_development/23.2%3a_germinal_stage) states that ""the germinal stage of development is the first and shortest of the stages of the human lifespan. the germinal stage lasts a total of eight to nine days. it begins in a fallopian tube when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm to form a zygote (day 0).""

1656373635,"that is something that is literally only alive and has human dna, regardless of whether or not it is unique. stem cells in adults have different dna depending on their role but the base dna is that of the person. the only characteristics at fertilization that a zygote has(which is what its called after fertilization if you read the quotes) is that it is alive and has human dna. 

from your own quote btw:

""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""
[jonathan van blerkom of university of colorado, expert witness on human embryology before the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 63]

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the¬†zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""

zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr.¬†zyg tos, yoked together), represents the¬†beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n.¬†before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1]

""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[considine, douglas (ed.).¬†van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943]

so at fertilization it is a zygote. its characteristics include only being alive and consisting of human dna. thats not debated by science. science also says that life is continuous. being human and being alive is not synonymous with personhood or being a human being. and the definition of human is as follows btw.

verizon has been rolling out c-band equipment onto their macro towers since the beginning of the year.

at&amp;t only within the last few months has started doing the same.

c-band is the wireless spectrum that both at&amp;t &amp; verizon spent billions on purchasing at multiple auctions a few years ago to be their anchor 5g bands across the country.

c-band support is physically built-in with the 3 pixel devices mentioned above but at the time of release google didn‚Äôt commit to enabling the support.

verizon meanwhile said they would be enabling the support in the future.

fast forward to march 2022 &amp; google announced in a google forum post that they would not enable c-band support with no explanation why.

https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-5-4a-5g-5a-verizon-c-band-support

https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991308/google-pixel-4a-5-5a-5g-c-band-pixel-6-software

around that time of the announcement verizon edited their support page to indicate that there would be no update for c-band.

https://www.verizon.com/support/software-updates-5g-ultrawideband/

all google has to do is enable the support for c-band with a software update and likely get the devices certified for both verizon &amp; at&amp;t networks.

why is this a big deal?  if you‚Äôre in an at&amp;t or verizon market that is getting the c-band upgrade you will see mobile dl speeds up to 700 mbps possibly more.  you will see reduced latency (less ping) and a much faster upload speed.  even if you‚Äôre not a heavy mobile user you should get a much better everyday experience in those upgraded markets.

if you‚Äôre paying that top dollar for an at&amp;t or verizon postpaid plan it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to use the pixel 5.

i am a t-mobile customer &amp; t-mobile did also purchase c-band licenses too but they did it to augment their existing spectrum licenses.  it was a limited amount of spectrum purchased.

n41 is the 5g band of the 2.5ghz spectrum they acquired from the sprint merger.  this is the band that will anchor their 5g network in the majority of their markets.  if your situation is this then i can recommend the pixel 5 as a daily driver.

if you‚Äôre a subscriber to at&amp;t or an m.v.n.o of at&amp;t i don‚Äôt recommend the pixel 5 as a daily driver.

if you‚Äôre a verizon or verizon mvno subscriber and you‚Äôre in an u.ltra w.ide b.and market with mmwave availability either the verizon version or google unlocked version should be ok.

https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en#zippy=%2cpixel

i just confirmed that both pixel 5 variants (verizon or google) do have mmwave bands built in.

what i don‚Äôt know is if the google version needs a separate update to enable them on verizon.

does the mother even have to try to breastfeed? you're attempting to dodge an uncomfortable question.

&gt; your whole argument here is the baby dies and we are happy for it because the mother got to choose. you completely miss the whole part where the baby was alive and born. a part of this world a member of society and do all the protections there of.

no, you pivoted from the ""it's not a person"" argument to the bodily autonomy argument. at this point, you should know the difference.

&amp;nbsp;

pro-choice arguments:

- fetus isn't a person, therefore abortion doesn't kill anyone, and it's a non-issue.

or

- fetus is a person, but it can still be killed since it's violating the bodily autonomy of the mother. a tragedy, but still morally permissible.

""the advantage of a scientific approach to the question of when life begins is that the answer is not based on opinion or personal values, but rather on direct observation. and in the modern age, we have very detailed observations, confirming beyond any reasonable doubt, that the cell produced by sperm-egg fusion (the zygote) is a human organism; i.e. a human being. we know this because immediately upon the binding and fusion of the gametes (a rapid event taking less than a quarter second to complete), the newly formed zygote enters into a sequence of molecular events that determine and direct its subsequent maturation and growth. the fact that the zygote autonomously initiates the process of embryonic development distinguishes it from a mere human cell and clearly indicates that it is a full and complete, albeit immature, member of the human species.""  -maureen condic, ph.d. |  february 13, 2017  [source](https://lozierinstitute.org/qa-with-the-scholars-science-and-the-beginning-of-human-life/)

""however, from a scientific standpoint, at the moment of fertilization of the egg by the sperm, a completely new organism is present. the organism is not a part of the mother‚Äôs body although he or she is located within the mother‚Äôs body. half of the time, the organism is a boy. the genetic complement of the new human being is unique and different from that of the mother."" -michael r. egnor, md, when does human life begin?

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity."" -o'rahilly, ronan and m√ºller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29",1.0,,-Asher-,0.0,False,False,True

1657804099,"&gt; is their dna not human?

the dna in a spem or egg is derived from a human but it incomplete to itself be human. it is estimated that there is a 99.9% commonality between any 2 humans' dna. that is the difference between by dna and yours. or my dna and a fetus' is less than one tenth of a percent. we share about 99.7% of our dna with neanderthals and about 98.8% with chimpanzees.

i don't know anyone who is prepared to argue that chimpanzees are human. so if we ball park it to a 99% or greater genetic match to be human than a sperm or egg with only 50% dna falls well short. while a fertilized egg has approximately enough of a genetic match to any other human as you and i do.

&gt;it's good that you acknowledge they can be understood as organisms, at least.

that is the basis of biology. organisms. you are one. i am one. a fetus is one.

&gt; they carry the amount of dna adequate to their stage of the human lifecycle. i think we both agree size and number of chromosomes should not be a factor in rights. 

dna is not a factor in if or what rights a human has. but is is absolutely a factor in if an organism is human or something else. dna is essentially instructions for the cellular operations of a biological entity. if i give you directions to my house but i cut out 50% of them are they still directions to my house? or somewhere else entirely?

&gt; i think development matters, but if you don't, you have no reason to exclude them. they depend on specific environments to move to the next stage, but dependency isn't morally relevant to you.

if you say development matters i point you back to my original statement how once we create a arbitrary marker for what point in development is necessary it could just as well be anything. 

one may decide having a heartbeat it the developmental marker. someone else may say being conscience of your own existance.

it's a great argument to keep the debate going. but again once you make some marker you are excluding some people which undermines the value of human rights because it means we could move that marker and start excluding anyone on a whim. or as john f kennedy put it, ""the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.""

&gt; ...we already consider people with extremely low intelligence unfit to make their own decisions and thus deprived of most rights...

are you saying that someone who has a mental handicap should not be allowed to live?

&gt; the universal declaration of human rights says all humans are ""born free and equal in dignity and rights"". it says nothing about before birth. ultimately, the two are working with two different standards for ""a human"".

is that quote really relevant? in what context? morally? legally? as far as i know that has no legal bearing. 

&gt;you need to look at the rationale as well: ""[humans] are endowed with reason and conscience"". the reason we strongly protect humans instead of, say, crabs, is not pure biology: it's about our mental and social faculties.

if that's the basis you want to go with then the mentally or socially handicapped have no rights. neither does a [1 year old child](https://www.parentingcounts.org/baby-begins-to-develop-self-awareness-15-24-months/)

i think it makes much more sense to turn to biology to answer this.

[people are trying](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/absent-roe-v-wade-will-qualifying-child-mean-more-tax-code)

&gt; so why can‚Äôt we force someone to breast feed another persons child? why can‚Äôt we force women to gestate the hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos in storage? 

if a mother is stranded at a ski lodge with her baby, with food but no formula, is she required by society to at least try to breastfeed? or can she return home with the corpse and high-five her friends for exercising her right to choose what to do with her body?

&gt; but if an organism is how you define a person, then an an embryo is a person. say you‚Äôre in a building that‚Äôs on fire, and you stumble into a room with a 5 year old and a case of 1000 human embryos in test tubes. you can only save one and escape from the fire or you all die. you‚Äôd obviously save 1000 human lives over 1 right?

at that ratio, i'd probably save the embryos, but i'm not sure what ratio is the threshold for me. 1:1, the 5 year old for sure, same with 5:1. i'd also save my friend or family member over x number of strangers, or a child instead of two extremely old people. do you have any arguments that you thought of yourself, instead of regurgitating trolley problem thought experiments you found on reddit?

&gt; so then you get to the definition of an organism, which has to be alive. much like viruses, which aren‚Äôt alive, fetuses can‚Äôt survive without their host. not a life, not an organism, not a person. 

i'd point you towards the basic biology. you wouldn't believe how many ignorant redditors i've cured.

1658461962,"no name for the story yet but the placeholder is 

**radiante**

bare with me as this is basically a rough draft and isn‚Äôt concrete as of yet. it‚Äôs just ideas i‚Äôve been typing down until i get a solid grasp of what i really want this story to be. 

‚Ä¢ **high voltage** : (protagonist) **radiante** 
18 year old down on his luck with the ability to manipulate electromagnetism. he can manipulate and generate electricity as well as having super strength, speed, agility, durability, electro senses, enhanced senses, healing/regeneration, levitation, and electro teleportation. he‚Äôs a vigilante that hunts down and captures monstrous beings called ‚Äúblights‚Äù that run rampant around the world. while he‚Äôs intelligent and courageous, he can often be naive to borderline ignorant and stubborn when it comes to working with other heroes or even his own decisions. one major downfall of his is his indecisive and hesitation that catches up to him and hurts his loved ones in the process. he‚Äôs often in conflict with balancing his normal life and his superhero alter ego. often even being in conflict with his own morality as well as he‚Äôs unsure if he‚Äôs doing the right thing. 

‚Ä¢ **knightwalker** : **radiante** 
co-leader of the **v.n.g.r.d.** : vindicate neutralize gather reclaim destroy (they‚Äôre a corporation that deals with blights). goes by the book (at least his anyway). knightwalker has the ability to manipulate shadows and darkness. he can be intangible, has super strength, speed, durability, agility, dark constructs, healing/regeneration, and use dark energy as concussive force. he‚Äôs also extremely skilled in martial arts and acrobatics. not to mention he‚Äôs one of the worlds best detectives (yes, he‚Äôs very much inspired by batman). as much as he addresses himself as dark and brooding, he‚Äôs very much a gentle hero who despises violence and killing blights. 

‚Ä¢ **heatwave** : **radiante** 
part of the **v.n.g.r.d.** , heatwave is an incredibly chill and nonchalant hero with little to no temper whatsoever. he often comes into conflict with knightshade for not taking things seriously when things get dire. despite his easygoing personality, his power is extremely dangerous. heatwave can manipulate fire and solar radiation, and by synthesizing solar radiation he‚Äôs capable of flight, super strength, speed, agility, durability, and super senses. 

‚Ä¢ **echo** : **radiante**
a villain turned hero, echo tries her best to be apart of the **v.n.g.r.d.** to redeem her transgressions and help get rid of the blights that run rampant around the world. echo can copy any **radiantes** (names of supers in this story) abilities and keep them. however the abilities she copies aren‚Äôt as powerful as the original she copies them from, as per her name, she gains the ‚Äúecho‚Äù of their power. because she can copy many powers at a time, she can and has been viewed as exponentially dangerous. 

‚Ä¢ **stargazer** : (antagonist) **radiante**
co-leader of the **v.n.g.r.d.** stargazer has an incredibly goofy yet charismatic personality that meshes really well with his ability to manipulate light. he can make light hard constructs, light concussive blasts, light sensory, invisibility, super strength, ftl speed, agility, durability, and healing/regeneration. stargazer however, as nice as he seems to be, is conniving, ingenious, and borderline sociopathic. he does an incredibly good job at keeping his facade without giving off a slight hint of malice. he believes that the only way to rid of the world of the blights is to take full control of **v.n.g.r.d.** with an iron fist as he believes that it‚Äôs the only way to save the world from the blights 

‚Ä¢ **aperture** : the second successful **mod** (they‚Äôre super powered people that gained their powers with man made scientific experimentation to combat radiantes and blights made by **a.e.s.i.r.** : advanced and enhanced security for individuals with resistance) has the power to teleport. she can also open up portals to any place she wants as long as she has been to or has seen before, this however takes a lot of energy out of her and puts her out of commission for a couple of minutes. at some point, while exerting her power in a pinch, she was able to teleport to a different point in time. she has only been able to do this once however and is unsure if she‚Äôs capable of doing it again. because she‚Äôs a mod she comes with the basic superhuman abilities such as super strength, speed, durability, and agility, although it‚Äôs not to the same level as typical radiantes. 

‚Ä¢ **all heart** : the original **mod** that had been frozen due to the potential danger he posed to the **a.e.s.i.r.** when they were first established as he didn‚Äôt agree to the their methods and beliefs. he‚Äôs essentially this universes superman with captain americas ideals of a better world. as of now he remains frozen.",1.0,,HighVoltage_520,0.0,False,False,True

pwc, oecd, citi bank, etc. many companies/intergovernmental institutions have economic projections.

&gt;but you went a step further and used ppp, instead of nominal.

it's hilarious. whenever europeans compare with the us they use ppp but when it comes to other countries they use nominal.

regardless, if you prefer nominal gdp would you be okay with accepting that the eu hasn't even recovered from the 2008 crisis yet? 14 years?

the best argument against ngdp is looking at places like saudi arabia, singapore, and hong kong. hong kong has enough foreign reserves to over cut half its exchange rate and double the value of its currency before the closing of the financial year and doubles the value of all *past transactions.* yes, the hong kong monetary authority can double its gdp by changing the exchange rate right before the books close.

anyways, your argument is poor. the entire purpose of ppp adjustments is ***because differences in nominal prices don't accurately capture real value.*** the most popular example of certain mcdonald's menu items costing $8-$9 in norway but $1.80 in egypt despite being the same exact product. and yes, some of the adjustments do include quality, especially in healthcare.

&gt;first of all, you ignored that nigeria has more than 3x the population of france

irrelevant to global politics. no one is talking about monaco, luxembourg, or uae being a great power. but people do talk about china a lot despite china having a smaller gdp per capita than some tiny sub saharan african nations.

""human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).
""fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. this fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.""

[dox, ida g. et al. the harper collins illustrated medical dictionary. new york: harper perennial, 1993, p. 146]


""embryo: the early developing fertilized egg that is growing into another individual of the species. in man the term 'embryo' is usually restricted to the period of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of pregnancy.""
[walters, william and singer, peter (eds.). test-tube babies. melbourne: oxford university press, 1982, p. 160]


""the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[langman, jan. medical embryology. 3rd edition. baltimore: williams and wilkins, 1975, p. 3]


""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[considine, douglas (ed.). van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943]


""i would say that among most scientists, the word 'embryo' includes the time from after fertilization...""

""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""

""the chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and male pronuclei. these pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2n nucleus of the fertilized zygote. this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
[larsen, william j. human embryology. 2nd edition. new york: churchill livingstone, 1997, p. 17]


""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
[o'rahilly, ronan and mÔøΩller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. this textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}]


""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
[carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3]


""[a]nimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....
""[a] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the word embryo to describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. in its place, they proposed the term pre-embryo....
""i'll let you in on a secret. the term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by ivf practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. the new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients. 'don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. they won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

we don't need to rely on canada's data, because late abortions happen in the us as well. here's an actual knowledge drop. according to arizona's data, which is the best data i know of, only a small fraction of later abortions are performed due to the health of either the mother or the fetus.

in this case, looking at abortions that occurred at 21 weeks or later.

[here's the 2020 report.](https://azdhs.gov/documents/preparedness/public-health-statistics/abortions/2020-arizona-abortion-report.pdf)

*tldr: in arizona, in 2020, at most 10% of abortions performed at 21 weeks or later were due to medical conditions of either the mother or fetus.*

- in 2020, there were 13,273 abortions performed in arizona (page 4)

- there were 169 abortions performed at 21+ weeks (page 17, table 10)

- fewer than six 21+ week abortions were performed due to maternal medical conditions. values under 6 are suppressed. (page 14, table 7)

- twelve 21+ week abortions were performed due to fetal medical conditions. (page 15, table 8)

**so, at most, 17 of the 169 21+ week abortions were performed due to medical conditions of either the mother or fetus.**

1661539268,"&gt; according to researchers b.e. zhilyaev, v.n. petukhov, and v.m. reshetnyk, the main astronomical observatory of nas of ukraine ‚Äúconducts an independent study of uap‚Äù which has managed to collect imagery depicting several anomalous aerial events. the team says it employs a pair of meteor stations located in kyiv and in the vinarivka village, each fitted with video cameras observing the daytime sky.

&gt; based on the events they have observed, they break down their observations of uap into two primary categories, which they call ‚Äúcosmics‚Äù and ‚Äúphantoms.‚Äù

&gt;‚Äúwe note that cosmics are luminous objects, brighter than the background of the sky,‚Äù the authors write, noting three subcategories of cosmics each named after various birds: swift, falcon, and eagle, whereas ‚Äúphantoms are dark objects, with contrast from several to about 50 percent.‚Äù

&gt;the ukrainian team says they have detected uap under a variety of conditions and have observed what they characterize as ‚Äúa significant number of objects whose nature is not clear.‚Äù

&gt; flights of single, group and squadrons of the ships were detected,‚Äù the paper states, with several of the objects exhibiting speeds ‚Äúfrom 3 to 15 degrees per second‚Äù and varying degrees of brightness that the team gauges within a range of 10 to 20 hz. the research team also employed synchronized camera systems that in one instance, according to their paper, ‚Äúallowed the detection of a variable object, at an altitude of 1170 km.‚Äù

&gt; ‚Äúphantoms are observed in the troposphere at distances up to 10 ‚Äì 12 km,‚Äù the researchers state in the paper, estimating their size as being between 3 and 12 meters and capable of speeds of as much as 15 kilometers per second.

&gt; unidentified anomalous, air, and space objects are deeply concealed phenomena,‚Äù the authors conclude, adding that the primary characteristic of the uap they have observed is ‚Äúextremely high speed.‚Äù

after introduction of capitalism and end of slavery in 1861 people were starting to get greedy and worrying only about profits, not life endurance. most of people, however, became even more like a slaves due to actions of greed-minded usurers, who forced people in loan cabala. they were destroying the farming communities of peasants called ‚Äúmira‚Äù (‚Äúworld‚Äù, ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in old russian), and they became called ‚Äúmiraeds‚Äù / ‚Äúmira‚Äù-devourers, or more commonly known word for them was ‚Äúkulaks‚Äù, originating from russian word ‚Äúfist‚Äù, as in ‚Äúholding someone in iron fist‚Äù. in 1860-1880 overall peasantry land fallen for 30%: from 4.6 to 3.5 ‚Äúdesyatin‚Äù (old russian unit of measurement of area of 10x10 yards). if in 1880-1890 amount of regions affected by famine was 18 at maximum, in 1890-1900 it was 29 at maximum; in 1901-1910 it was 49 in 1911-1912 it was 60

since the beginning of the 20th century, the hungry years have gone one after another.  ‚Äúin the winter of 1900-1901, 42 million people were starving, and 2,813,000 orthodox souls died as a result of this famine.‚Äù  the years of famine were 1902 and 1903, which escalated into popular riots.  in 1902-1903, 200,000 regular troops, that is, 1/5 of the entire russian army of those years, were used to suppress peasant uprisings and protests of workers in the poltava and kharkov provinces alone, and this is not counting hundreds of thousands of gendarmes, cossacks and policemen. at the beginning of the 20th century, not only bad weather prevented the ripening of bread, but also popular riots, which turned into a revolution of 1905-1907, also act as reasons.  the famine of 1905 struck 22 provinces, including four non-chernozem provinces ‚Äî pskov, novgorod, vitebsk, kostroma.  famine was observed in 1906, 1907 and 1908.  ""the consumption of food grains (except for oats) per capita on average in 1901-1904 was equal to 16.36 pounds, in the next four-year famine of 1905-1908 it dropped to 13.69 pounds on average or decreased by 16%, in the most lean year - 1906/07 - up to 12.57 pounds or 23%.  this famine was accompanied by a sharp increase in morbidity.  the number of cases of scurvy alone from 1905 to 1907 increased by 528%.  case, in particular epidemics of measles and scarlet fever among children.  in 1911 (already after the vaunted stolypin reforms): ‚Äú32 million starved, 1 million 613 thousand people died from this famine‚Äù (in total, more than 8 million people died from hunger from 1900 to 1912).  but even when there was no big famine in russia, this does not mean that people ate their fill, it only means that they did not starve.  moreover, even in such years, individual counties were starving.  even in the ""normal"" years, the situation was difficult.  this is evidenced by the very low level of the officially established ""physiological minimum"" - 14 pounds of bread per year, and bread was the main food of the inhabitants of the pre-revolutionary village.  in 1907, prince d.n. svyatopolk-mirsky stated in the state duma that 212 kg of bread were consumed per capita in russia, while in england - 299 kg, in france - 363 kg, in germany - 317 kg.

[https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html](https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html)

from tankograd:

in the memoirs ""life given to tanks"" dedicated to the ukbtm chief designer v.n venediktov, published in 2010, g. a. kheifits, a leading specialist in the department of armour at ukbtm who was appointed to the state commission for testing the t-72b tank, describes the live fire tests against mock ups of the t-72b upper glacis and other experimental armour designs developed by the ukbtm design bureau that took place at the proving grounds of the main missile and artillery directorate (grau) in donguz (in the southern urals). at the same time, various armour designs developed by the lkz design bureau were also being tested at the same proving grounds, including a mock up of the t-80bv upper glacis. the tests were carried out with the 125mm 3bm-32 ""vant"" monobloc du long rod apfsds ammunition, which was the newest ammunition of its type available in the soviet army in 1985.

according to kheifits, the tests of the t-72b armour designed by ukbtm were successful. even after increasing the amount of propellant to launch the ""vant"" round at its maximum permissible velocity, it was not possible to break through the armour. on the other hand, the armour designed by lkz was perforated by ""vant"" when fired from a standard propellant charge.

using the lanz-odermatt equation, the perforation limit of 3bm32 ""vant"" at its muzzle velocity of 1,710 m/s is calculated to be 192mm at 68 degrees (\~513mm los), with the target being medium hardness rha (270 bhn). to convert from initial perforation to nominal defeat, a physical thickness of 10mm is added, translating to an effective thickness figure of 540mm. in other words, to resist 3bm32 at its muzzle velocity, the effective thickness of the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour must equivalent to around 540mm rha. with the armour having the same weight as 454mm of steel, this implies that the mass efficiency coefficient of the armour is only 1.18 which is less than the 1.2 coefficient of the ""reflection-1"" array.

the so-called ""maximum permissible velocity"" is assumed to be the muzzle velocity of ""vant"" at a charge temperature of +40¬∞c, which is listed as the maximum temperature in a nimi (research institute of the machine industry) catalogue. with 12/7 v/a propellant, the difference in muzzle velocity at 15¬∞c and 40¬∞c is +2.5%. the maximum permissible velocity is therefore around 1,753 m/s. at this velocity, the perforation limit is calculated to be 195mm rha at 68 degrees (\~522mm los). converting to nominal defeat, the effective thickness of the armour would be around 550mm rha.

in the article ""–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –æ—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º —Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∏: –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞ –∏ –≤—ã–º—ã—Å–ª—ã"" published in the november 2006 issue of the ""–∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ"" magazine, it is stated on page 14 that the protection of the 1985 model of the t-72b is equivalent to more than 550mm rha against apfsds rounds. this figure may be referring to either the turret or the hull, but in any case, it is consistent with the estimated effective thickness of the armour based on its performance against 3bm32 in live fire tests.

based on this, the me coefficient of the armour is 1.2, which is not higher than the ""reflection-1"" array. this is not consistent with the increased complexity of the armour array, but nevertheless, it is supported by some evidence.

according to swedish trials, 120mm dm33 perforates a los thickness of 530mm rha at 200 meters and a los thickness of 470mm rha at 2,000 meters, converted from its perforation limits on armour sloped at 60 degrees. based on this, dm33 should perforate a los thickness of 565mm rha and 500mm rha against armour set at 68 degrees at 200 meters and 2,000 meters respectively. based on these figures alone, the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour is nominally capable of resisting dm33 at a range of around 1,000 meters.

against armour set at 68 degrees, m829 perforates a los thickness of 552mm rha at its muzzle velocity and a los thickness of 522mm rha at 2,000 meters. from this, it can be estimated that the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour is nominally capable of resisting m829 at a range of around 500 meters and above.

the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour is 1.35 times heavier than the 80-105-20 armour used in the t-72 ural and t-72 ural-1. however, thanks to a substantial improvement in mass efficiency, the calculated effective thickness is 1.83 times is greater than the 80-105-20 armour.",4.0,,JZ0487,0.0,False,False,True

meanwhile in the uk, the official measure of [real pay](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/october2022) fell -1.7% over the same period. but that's unfit for comparison because they are using cpih rather than cpi to deflate earnings. if we adjust for the cpi-cpih spread, uk real pay declined by -2.6% between june 2021 and june 2022. still notably better than the eurozone aggregate.

note also that we only have eurozone wage data up to q2, so it's already quite stale. we know that inflation went from 8.6% in june to 10.6% in october, and it's very unlikely that wage's have appreciated at a comparable rate, so the -4.1% figure quoted earlier has probably deteriorated further.",2.0,,kanyewestsconscience,0.0,False,False,True

[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1] 

""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
[carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3]


""[a]nimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....
""[a] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the word embryo to describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. in its place, they proposed the term pre-embryo....
""i'll let you in on a secret. the term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by ivf practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. the new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients. 'don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. they won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

lastly, god does not command abortion. the verse you‚Äôre probably referring to is hosea 13:16, where it states: ‚Äúsamaria is held guilty, for she has rebelled against her god. they shall fall by the sword, their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child ripped open.‚Äù nowhere does it state that god commanded this, rather it is a prophecy/warning about what is going to happen to israel for abandoning god. they will be invaded by their enemies and they shall do these horrible things to them. as always, may the blessing of our lord be with you.",1.0,,repentantsinner07,0.0,False,False,True
1668997852,"a few other thoughts that are worthy of comment on this subject:

in general the issue here is the concept of a quorum. in traditional voting schemes, which count unique individuals, a quorum standard is expressed as a percentage of the voting population present and voting. note that we cannot use ""head count"" as a quorum standard in gridcoin, for the same reason that counting raw votes (i.e. not vote weight) is not a valid measure.

to understand why, you need to delve into the issue of unique voter identification and sybil attacks. in general to be able to use a voting scheme that gives one person one vote, you need to be able to reliably identify unique individuals and correlate each vote to an individual. this is devilishly difficult in a public blockchain voting system for a number of reasons, not the least of which would be the requirement of a centralized, intrusive ""know your customer"" biometric identification, which does not admit easily to verification by the nodes on the network for the actual correlation of the cast votes.

a sybil attack in the voting context is where voting power is multiplied by an actor by manipulating the apparent voting presence on the network. it is easy to see that if the vote were based on a single utxo voting, which counts as one individual, a bad actor could arbitrarily multiply their voting power by simply splitting up their assets among many utxo's held in different wallets, voting in each one, which would manufacture apparent additional individuals from the one person one vote perspective.

so, if one is not going to put into place sophisticated, unwieldly, and ultimately centralized individual identification programs, then one must ask what voting metrics survive the sybil attack problem. the answer is very deep and very definitive. the only class of metrics that survive are metrics that satisfy the property in mathematics of linearity:

define a voting metric m operating on cast votes v.i where i = 1 ... n.

then a linear voting metric v would satisfy the condition that

m(v.1 + v.2 + ... + v.n) = m(v.1) + m(v.2) + ... + m(v.n)

this ensures that no matter how an actor distributes their assets, i.e. pooling them and voting one time, or separating them out and voting each separately, they have the exact same voting power.

the only metrics available in gridcoin for voting that satisfy this property are metrics that are verifiably linear: balance and balance + magnitude. this is why in fern all other forms of voting metrics were deprecated besides those two. the others are subject to trivial sybil attacks and are invalid.

note that since we cannot reliably uniquely identify individuals voting, the quorum qualification rules must also follow the same concept. they must be based on sybil proof measures. this is what gives rise to the avw % metric, which also satisfies the above property of linearity as a voting metric, and is the best metric we have to judge whether a quorum has been met, given that we cannot use the number of votes cast.

the above may be a bit abstract and deep for many folks, but it is exceedingly important to understand. the same limitations unfortunately give rise to the other concern about voting power concentrated with a few (impossible to reliably identify) individuals with large balances ""whales"", but this is the best we can do without going down that other road of coercively and reliably identifying individuals for one-person, one-vote, voting metrics.",7.0,,jamescowens,0.0,False,False,True

1669373639,"you want sources, fine:

because wage data for a lot of eu countries is only quarterly, we will look at the most recent release (q2) that is available for everyone. for the uk, where the data is monthly, i will for the sake of simplicity, use the reference end month of the quarter, it doesn't make much difference anyway. furthermore, because the pandemic caused all sorts of noise in the employment data (due to things like furlough), we will go back to q2 2019. so, now lets look at realised wage growth in both nominal and real terms over the last 3 years.

- uk: [average weekly earnings](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/november2022), total pay was ¬£538 in june 2019 and ¬£612 in june 2022. so, 13.8% nominal wage growth over the past 3 years. [realised inflation](https://www.rateinflation.com/consumer-price-index/uk-cpi/) over the same period was 13.5% - index went from 107.93 to 121.79. so, all together we have roughly 0.3% positive real wage growth. 

- now lets look at the eurozone as a whole. [compensation per employee](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?series_key=320.mna.q.y.i8.w2.s1.s1._z.com_ps._z._t._z.ix.v.n) (their analogue of awe) has gone from 107.3 in q2 2019 to 115.11 in q2 2022 (this is a normalised index rather than euro values, but it measures the same thing). so wage growth in the euro bloc was 7.2% over the past 3 years. now, euro area inflation, as measured by hicp, went from 104.8 in june 2019 to 116.3 in june 2022, or 11.0% cumulative. combining these, we find that real wage growth in the euro area has been -3.8% over the past 3 years.

so, as i said originally, not only has nominal wage growth massively outperformed in the uk compared to the eurozone, but it's also considerably better in real terms. i can drill down into individual eu countries if you want, the conclusion is the same. on that point, in a separate comment i give the values for [germany](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/z3gecf/uk_sees_highest_net_migration_since_second_world/ixpo5o9/), with sources, which shows that *nominal* wages rose a measly 4.2% in the past 3 years.
