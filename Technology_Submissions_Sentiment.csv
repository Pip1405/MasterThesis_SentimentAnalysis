1641194048;a friend works for apple and is given stock every year. they own ~100k of apple stock now but no other etfs. should they just keep it, given it’s one the best ones to own, or should they sell some to diversify?;"As per title, I don’t know what to recommend this friend should do in their position.

They keep getting stock each year, and can get more (in to 10% of their salary every year) which is also discounted by 15%.

I’d usually recommend diversifying at least on the S&amp;P500 (eg IVV, we’re in Australia).

But in this case, AAPL is well performing, the company’s fundamentals are there, and the future of Apple looks good in our opinion.

Would you give up AAPL to diversify? How much? How often?

1641976095;removal of apple stock apps from x device using profiles;"Hi all,

I'm trying to remove the FindMy app from my daughters iPod Touch (Apple allow any family member to activate lock mode on any device, which for a 6 year olds device is quite silly).

I've created a configuration profile using Apple Configurator 2 which I have installed on the device, but its not removing the app.

I served up the mobileconfig file using a webserver which I then manually installed using settings on the device.

Does anyone know this may not be working?

1643304150;mastercard stock slips on earnings, but american express jumps 9%;"#### Key points:

* Mastercard stock dropped 2% despite positive earnings
* An increase in consumer spending, particularly travel, is returning to pre-pandemic levels
* In a big week for payment providers, Mastercard's earnings appear diminished next to American Express's $12.1B revenue, sending stock surging 9%

This is a big week for investors who are looking at payment providers; with American Express, Mastercard, and Visa all reporting earnings. During the height of the pandemic, payment providers felt the tightening of the economic landscape through a wavering of consumer spending – however, with American Express posting strong results yesterday, and Mastercard beating estimates today – it seems that consumer spending is starting to bounce back.

Mastercard’s (NYSE: MA) Q4 net income rose to $2.38B from $1.79B, or $2.41 per share from $1.78. Adjusted, Mastercard earned $2.35 per share compared to $1.64 the previous year; beating consensus at $2.21. The company reported a revenue of $5.22B, showing a $4.12B increase year-on-year, beating a general estimate of $5.17B.

On another note, the company saw cross-border volume rising 53%, with cross-border spending back to pre-pandemic levels; a great sign for the payment provider that traditional spending habits are returning. 

However, looking at Mastercard stock; investors remained apprehensive, despite the news on cross-border spending returning to pre-pandemic levels on the return of the travel buzz. Inflationary woes might be playing a part in the absence of bulls this morning, perhaps concerned about levels of domestic spending moving forward; pushing MA stock down roughly 2% in early trading.

Looking over to American Express (NYSE: AXP), it seems to be a similar narrative, yet there are a few stand-out financials that investors might want to pay attention to. Most importantly, the company has chosen to serve a specific market segment, and it seems to be working incredibly well.

American Express posted revenue of $12.1B at a quarterly increase of 30%, more than double the revenue of Mastercard for a smaller market slice. The market reacted positively, with the stock surging around 9%. It seems that AMEX’s strategy is infallible at the moment; and strategy-wise, the company seems like a more valuable investment.";8;0;Asktraders178;StocksAndTrading;Positive;Neutral;Positive

“Visa Inc. topped $7 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, buoyed by a quicker-than-expected resumption in travel spending and sustained growth in categories like e-commerce that had been strong throughout the pandemic.

The company generated fiscal first-quarter net income of $4.0 billion, or $1.83 a share, up from $3.1 billion, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Visa V earned $1.81 a share. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.70 in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share.

Visa’s revenue rose to $7.06 billion from $5.69 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $6.79 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet weren’t expecting Visa to cross the $7 billion revenue mark until the June quarter.

Payments volume rose 20%, while processed transactions increased 21%. The company saw a 51% increase in cross-border volume when excluding intra-Europe transactions and a 40% bump in overall cross-border volume.”";114;15;randomaccount0923;stocks;Positive;Negative;Positive

1643482755;"visa stock price jumps 5% on strong e-commerce &amp; travel return";"#### Key points:

* Visa stock jumps 5% on positive Q1 earnings
* Strong growth in e-commerce and a resurgance in travel were key benefactors this quarter
* Visa posted net revenue of $7.1B at an increase of 24%

Following American Express and Mastercard, Visa (NYSE: VISA) was the last to report earnings this week. The company’s Q1 report was received well by investors; with stock price currently showing a premarket gain of just over 5%. 

It has been a mixed week for the payment providers. American Express posted a steller revenue of over $12B, sending the stock soaring early in the week, yet Mastercard’s earnings were interpreted much more negatively, with price action driving the stock down around 2%. 

Looking across the earnings reports; similar trends vouch for an improving economic landscape, with a gradual shift in post-pandemic consumer spending providing a clearer picture of a return back to traditional spending habits. 

Visa recorded growth across various sectors; payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth all accelerated on a year-on-year basis – but it was the strong growth in e-commerce and a resurgence in international travel that bolstered the company’s Q1.

With a defiant Covid outlook, the company doesn’t expect rising cases to deflect an increase in international travel in the coming quarter, meaning that we might be a further increase from an already impressive 40% increase in cross-border volume. 

Visa posted net revenue of $7.1B at a rise of 24%, while net profit also improves 25% to $3.9B.

1643738086;what is the metaverse equivalent of buying apple stock in 2008?;"TLDR:  If you were going to invest $1000 in the metaverse today, where would you spend it?

*******************

[Augmented reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs) is probably coming.  There's too much money to be made there for companies to ignore it.

As  /u/Sumit316 puts it in [this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/shtudj/big_tech_needs_to_stop_trying_to_make_their/):  


&gt; ""What is most striking about the buzz around the Metaverse is that everyone claims to be building it, but no one knows what it really will be or what it should look like—and whether people will ever want to use it. As WIRED’s editor in chief Gideon Lichfield put it, we are witnessing “a terminological land grab”: Companies and entrepreneurs have sensed some kind of change coming in the air, and they are scrambling to call it the next big thing, put their label on it (in some case going to Meta-rebranding-level extremes), and find ways of monetizing it. The question is whether we—the intended users—will go along with it.

&gt; The shift that Big Tech has spotted is obvious: Over the past few years people have started spending much more time online. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated that vertiginously. For the white-collar workers who were asked to work from home, the office instantly shrunk to the size of a screen. Free time, for identical reasons, was also forced to find digital alternatives. With cinemas closed, and bars shut, and parties out of the question (unless you worked for the UK Government), bored people spent an inordinate amount of time playing video-games, on engaging in gamified activities such as flipping meme stocks and dabbling in crypto or crypto-adjacent products (like NFT pictures). In some cases the two things merged into strange chimeras of games and cryptofinance, making online pay-for-play universes like Axie Infinity, the NFT-based video game, a source of revenue for impoverished Filipinos. Meta et al’s gamble is that this state of affairs will persist, and eventually evolve—by way of faster internet, better VR, and a more functional online economy—into the Metaverse, aka the next internet.""


Yes, NFTs and memes are dominating the discussion right now.  

But I feel like there's a gold rush coming on.  And companies are going to make a lot of money.

How might a prudent investor buy in nowadays?  What are the equivalent of ""safe, Blue Chip stocks"" that might be around in 20 years?

1643847697;meta stock buybacks are suspicious;"I’m very sceptical of FB’s 40+ BILLION stock buyback program. You might think it’s a good way to bring value to shareholders. I thought the same. Although, it occured to me that it might be a signal to investors that FB has no better way of allocating the capital! 

Do they not need money? They are still a growth company, with a huge new project (metaverse). Surely they could spend more on their new and existing projects and platforms? Oculus really couldn’t benefit of any more money? 

You could say the same thing about Apple. Are they not perhaps building a car!? They could spend many billions on that project, easy. Instead they spent 85 billion on share buybacks last year. 

I know: Investors like dividends and share buybacks. It’s better than music to the ears. And yes; if they spend too much money on r&amp;d, it might look like the expenses are going up. 

I’m still sceptical. 

I’ll leave you with this: You know who loves share buybacks? IBM.";0;12;Einsteinianjedi;StockMarket;Positive;Positive;Negative

- I own a house that I purchased in 2017, it’s worth almost 200K more than I got it for
- I have less than 6K in credit card debt 
- I just purchased a new car( cash) and have no monthly payment 

With all of that said, I’ve only briefly dabbled in stocks and have recently begun talking with financial experts and advisors …..but there’s so much information and I don’t know what to trust. My questions are:

1- How much should I have sitting in a savings ?
2- What’s the difference between and index fund and hedge fund?
3- Is the Money Market a better place to invest money over the Stock Market?
4- Which is the best option to have my money making money ?";1;7;Tomma16;personalfinance;Positive;Positive;Neutral

Nvidia
$643B market Cap / $16B annual rev. = 40yrs

AMD
$150B market Cap / $16B annual revenue = 9yrs

Intel
$199B market Cap / $79B annual revenue = 2.5yrs

- Nvidia stock is valued 340% higher than AMD.
- Nvidia stock is value 1500% higher than Intel.

I’ll attach that link below to the video that indicates this to give you some perspective. So I’m looking for the best time efficient method but at the same time wouldn’t burn a hole in my pocket like the easy drummers-base software does starting at 179 $, if I could get everyone’s opinion here on their experience and how it is for being the best efficient and cost-effective as possible and whether or not the $179 price tag for EZ drummer would be worth it. If you feel that easy drummer isn’t worth it I’d appreciate any recommendations for other third-party drum machines.

Shares of technology company Nvidia dropped by 5%, They continue to fall as news of Federal Reserve new monetary policy spread. The fed will continue to gradually increase interest rates to reduce inflation up to may. Investors are expecting moderate interest rate increase but Fed might increase higher than expected. Which made investors concerned it would slow down the economy. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. And can lower the company relative value. Investors should try to maintain a long term vision of company’s performance. Since Nvidia is still one of the best in the computer processors market. Therefor they might want to ignore some of the market noise.

1651013761;microsoft stock rallies on strong earnings and outlook;"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-price-earnings-51650921904](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-price-earnings-51650921904?mod=hp_LEAD_1_B_3)

[Microsoft ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/msft)is providing tech investors with some badly needed good news, reporting better-than-expected results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31.

After some initial volatility, the stock is trading higher after hours. It’s being boosted by a strong outlook for the June quarter, despite Microsoft expressing some concerns about Covid shutdowns in Chinese factories affecting hardware.

For the March quarter, Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) posted revenue of $49.4 billion, up 18% from a year ago, and well above the Wall Street consensus forecast of $47.5 billion. The company earned $2.22 a share in the quarter, beating the Wall Street consensus by three cents a share.

Microsoft noted that results were reduced by about three cents a share by unfavorable exchange rates, while the recent acquisition of Nuance Communications trimmed profits by about a penny a share. Neither of those factors was reflected in previous company guidance. Microsoft has suspended new sales in Russia, but the company previously said that sales in the country are well under 1% of total company revenue. 

Microsoft said commercial bookings in the quarter were better-than-expected, up 28% from a year ago, or 35% adjusted for currency. The company’s commercial cloud business, which includes Azure, Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn’s commercial business and Dynamics 365, had combined revenue of $23.4 billion, up 32%.

Microsoft had solid results in all three of its business segments.

Revenue in the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office and other applications, was $15.8 billion, up 17%, toward the top of the company’s guidance range of $15.6 billion to $15.85 billion, and just ahead of the Wall Street consensus for $15.75 billion.

For the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes the company’s Azure cloud business, revenues were $19.1 billion, up 26%, ahead of both the company’s guidance range of $18.75 billion and $19 billion, and the Wall Street consensus at $18.89 billion. The company’s Azure cloud computing business grew 46% in the quarter, or 49% in constant currency.

For the More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, Surface and Xbox, revenue was $14.5, likewise ahead of both the company’s guidance range of $14.15 billion to $14.45 billion, and the Wall Street forecast of $14.3 billion.

Revenue was up 34% at LinkedIn, while search and new ad revenue ex-traffic acquisition costs was up 23%. Microsoft doesn’t routinely disclose the size of its overall ad business; last quarter the company noted that on a trailing 12 months basis, the combined ad business had topped $10 billion.

Surface hardware revenue was up 13%, while Xbox hardware revenue was up 14%. Windows Commercial products revenue was up 14%, while Windows OEM revenue, from sales to PCs sold at retail was up 11%. Office commercial products were up 12%, while Office consumer revenue was up 11%.

On a conference call with investors, CFO Amy Hood projected better-than-expected results for the June quarter.

She sees revenue for the company’s Productivity and Business Processes segment of between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion, at the midpoint of the range ahead of the Street consensus at $16.68 billion. For Intelligent Cloud, she projects revenue of between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion, ahead of consensus at $20.9 billion.

For the More Personal Computing segment, she’s projecting a range of $14.65 billion to $14.95 billion, a little below the Street consensus at $14.96 billion, reflecting current Covid-related manufacturing shutdowns in China, which affects both Surface and Xbox hardware, and software sales to PC manufacturers.

Overall, the segment guidance implies a total revenue range of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion, at the midpoint about in line with Street estimates.

Hood said that currency headwinds would reduce revenue in the quarter by about 2 percentage points. She also noted that the June results will include a full quarter of Nuance results. Hood added that results would be reduced by about $110 million from suspending sales in Russia.

Microsoft said it repurchased $7.8 billion of its common stock in the quarter.

In volatile after hours trading, Microsoft shares were up 6%, after they fell 3.7% in Tuesday’s regular session.

Heading into the earnings report tonight, Microsoft shares had been down about 20% year to date.";50;16;_hiddenscout;stocks;Positive;Negative;Positive

1652274675;nvidia stock: new growth areas to secure its future;"Cloud providers and household-name technology companies were hit hard last Thursday. This caused hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization to evaporate in a single day and pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to its biggest one-day decline since 2020. Investors reacted to last week's Fed rate hike with a frenzy of selling, pushing down growth-driving sectors like technology and health care.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the current market problems, I continue to be bullish on NVIDIA ($NVIDIA([NVDA.US](https://NVDA.US))$).

&amp;#x200B;

Nvidia is a company that specializes in the manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs). It is also a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. It has been working with artificial intelligence for more than 20 years and helping to make it easier for everyone to use.

&amp;#x200B;

Nvidia's GPU technology can help companies that want to use AI but don't have the resources or expertise to build their own hardware.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, Nvidia is playing an important role in the transition to Web 3.0, a term used to describe the future of the Internet. This is an important area of economic investment that will be supported by companies such as Nvidia.

&amp;#x200B;

The company is very profitable and has seen significant growth in revenue and free cash flow over the past few years. The value of this company should continue to grow rapidly. Therefore, the current decline seems like it could prove to be a good buying opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

NVIDIA's New Growth Areas

So far, INVISTA's stock has fallen sharply this year. Investors can take advantage of this opportunity as NVIDIA can maintain the performance of the last few years and the growth of its gaming division sales revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

NVIDIA is one of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies. Nvidia's latest products include Xavier, an AI chip that powers self-driving cars.

&amp;#x200B;

To stay competitive in the increasingly popular and disruptive field of artificial intelligence, Nvidia has been investing in making its products cheaper. As the focus on the automotive market shifts, opportunities for significant revenue generation will open up.

&amp;#x200B;

Gaming is now a large part of NVIDIA's revenue. The division has grown significantly, contributing nearly $12.5 billion in sales for fiscal year 2022 (46% of NVIDIA's revenue), and investors don't seem too worried about the future. There is a huge market of people interested in gaming.

&amp;#x200B;

The opportunities in the automotive space are much greater. In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA's automotive business will generate just $566 million in revenue, representing just over 2% of its total sales. In addition, the automotive business grew only 6% last year compared to NVIDIA's gaming business.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors should take into account that NVIDIA is a well-known company in the gaming industry. It started selling graphics cards to high-end PCs and gaming consoles decades ago. NVIDIA has a firm grip on the graphics card market, controlling about 80% of the market. This may not last forever, but the outlook for NVIDIA is strong.

Bottom Line on NVDA Stock

NVIDIA has just announced that they are now a three-chip company and now have a larger portfolio of products. As both processors become more common, the demand for NVIDIA products will increase as the company becomes the preferred GPU choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Management has had significant success recently and has made many important decisions that will affect the future of the business. NVDA stock may fit into the portfolios of many investors.";1;0;Otto_Bess;u_Otto_Bess;Positive;Neutral;Positive

1652727158;$aapl - 'big short' investor michael burry reveals bet against apple stock — and built stakes in alphabet and meta last quarter;"[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5)

 

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, placed a bet against [Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) and loaded up on other stocks last quarter, a [Securities and Exchange Commission filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761922010747/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml) revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management held bearish put options against 206,000 Apple shares as of March 31. The iPhone maker's stock price has roughly quadrupled since the start of 2019, but has slumped by 16% this quarter alone.

Scion held only six stocks at the end of December. The hedge fund exited all of those holdings except Bristol-Myers Squibb last quarter, but added the likes of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Discovery to its portfolio.

The slew of purchases helped to boost the total value of Scion's US stocks (excluding options) by 122% to $165 million. The fund's largest long positions as of March 31 were a $22 million stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb, roughly $19 million stakes in Booking Holdings and Discovery, and a $18 million stake in Alphabet.

Scion didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.

It's worth noting that Burry [trumpeted Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-spotted-apple-warren-buffett-stock-investment-2021-3-1030186770?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) as a stock worthy of Warren Buffett in 1999 — about 17 years before the Berkshire Hathaway CEO invested in the company. Berkshire now counts Apple as the number-one holding in its stock portfolio, and Buffett [recently revealed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-annual-shareholder-meeting-charlie-munger-stocks-2022-4?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) he added to his company's own position last quarter.

Burry is [best known](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-gamestop-crypto-crash-2022-1?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) for calling and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, [paving the way](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-investor-michael-burry-scion-gamestop-stock-price-frenzy-2021-2-1030050393?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) for the meme-stock craze by investing in GameStop and penning letters to the video-game retailer's board, and [betting against](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund last year.

Over the past two years, Burry has singled out Tesla, GameStop, bitcoinn, dogecoinn, Robinhood, and the white-hot US housing market as examples of speculative excess in financial markets.

Last June, the Scion chief [warned of](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-twitter-return-biggest-market-bubble-ever-2021-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" and [cautioned](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) that retail investors were piling into meme stocks and cryptocurrencies before the ""mother of all crashes.""

Burry [slashed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-market-crash-q3-portfolio-2021-11?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) his US stock portfolio from more than 20 holdings to only six in the third quarter of 2021, reducing its total value (excluding options) from almost $140 million to $42 million. The Scion chief [swapped out](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-q4-stock-portfolio-cvs-bms-2022-2?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) three of his remaining six holdings in the fourth quarter, which helped to lift the value of his portfolio to $74 million at the end of December.";273;170;Street_Country_1266;wallstreetbets;Positive;Positive;Positive

1654289806;apple stock potentially nearing a bottom;"Highly traded stock Apple has seen a downtrend lately, but this appears to be short term noise when we look at the long term price trend.  The stock recently pushed up above its 20 day moving average, and this could be a good sign for a reversal of the recent downward trend.  Buyers are likely to fill demand around the $135 price level, so watch the stock to potentially rebound around these levels before continuing upward.

1654364516;18 insiders have sold aapl stock over the past 6 months;"I have been investing in Triple leveraged ETF's for some time, my investment strategy is very simple to watch the corporate insider moves and super investors buys and sells and adjust my portfolio accordingly. Why do I do this? 1) Because it works 2) I have a sneaky suspicion insider orgs/corporates know something we don't

&amp;#x200B;

 A large # of institutional investors sold Apple much earlier in the year. Had we followed along in Feb and sat on the sidelines we would be sitting pretty good on the sidelines.

&amp;#x200B;

I always check every month for any updates to the corporate/insider buys and apply the same logic to the leveraged ETF.

What's the downside? Ofcourse this isn't a 100% win rate strategy but if we can time our exits with these investors we can avoid losing a huge part of our portfolio. Buy and hold still beats this strategy by a decent amount but we wouldn't be down **64%** like the underlying ETF.

&amp;#x200B;

We have the benefit of hindsight but i don't plan on buying PRO Leveraged ETF's until we start seeing some institutional investor buys and even then ill DCA. For now the plan is the DCA buy shorting QQQ.";14;10;SpamSteal;TQQQ;Positive;Positive;Negative

Jeff Brown is running one of his older stock presentations hyping a company he claims will help in the S.A.V market (sharing autonomous vehicle).

The company being teased makes sensors for Tesla and will help them become fully autonomous in the future.

The problem?

Jeff is withholding the stock unless you buy his newsletter.

Well I have some good news.. I was able to figure out the name of the stock.

**I reveal the name of the company in the video below:**

Additionally, I give you information about the stock so you can determine if it's a good buy.

So can we please get the ability to bind a key to toggle the v-stock on/off at will without going into the settings menu? That would be perfection for me!

He owns 333 million Microsoft stocks which are valued at 268 dollars a piece. 

Golden state warriors will probably have bigger payroll than clippers at some point but just to give you some context of the wealth difference I'll say this: 

If Microsoft stock goes down 2 % Ballmer would lose 1.784 billion which is more than Joe Lacobs entire net worth of 1.5 billion. I was inspired to write this post where Lacob said that it would be impossible to have a 400-500 million dollar payroll which makes lot of sense when you take a look at the situation.

1657857037;apple stock: should investors worry about price target cuts?;"Citi: Apple Phones Last Too Long

Citi analyst Jim Suva recently cut his price target on Apple from $200 to a still-bullish $175. Suva lowered his price target due to factors such as foreign exchange headwinds and concerns that Apple's Russian exodus will hurt the company's growth.

But according to Suva, the biggest short-term concern for Apple's stock is the potential lengthening of device replacement cycles. According to reports, users now tend to go four years without upgrading their smartphones.

Combined with weaker consumer spending due to inflation, this could put negative pressure on iPhone shipments and result in fewer units sold.

However, the analyst listed five good reasons to remain bullish on Apple:

The launch of the iPhone 14 in September and the debut of a foldable phone in 2023
A product mix that deviates from lower-priced Android models
Apple's plans to buy back about $90 billion in stock
Apple's ""sticky"" service revenues
Upcoming releases such as virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) products and the Apple Car, which are not yet reflected in the company's market cap

1658081711;apple stock reddit analysis (aapl);"# AAPLE Stocks

In the last two years, Apple's share price has doubled thanks to the attention that investors have devoted to the technology sector during the restrictions adopted around the world to face the Covid-19 pandemic.

Apple was the first company to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion. It was in 2018. It was also the first US company to reach a market cap of $2 trillion and the first to reach $3 trillion (January 3, 2022).

Its shares are among the most traded assets of the last decade, both among institutional and private investors. Since the low reached as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the price of Apple shares on the stock market has experienced a [rise of 170%](https://capexinsider.com/insider-week/?orid=30023&amp;opid=84).

Investors who bought 10 shares of Apple at the time of Apple's IPO have seen the value of their investment rise from $220 to a whopping $112,268.8. Due to the spectacular rise in the price of its shares in recent years, the company decided to carry out a stock split to make investment more accessible.

In this article, we will explain if it is still interesting to buy Apple stock and how recent events are affecting its behavior. We will use technical analysis and fundamental analysis so that you have the necessary information to make the decision that best suits your needs.

# Invest in Apple - Steve Jobs

The return of Apple founder Steve Jobs to the company marked a turning point. The apple company was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1997, it was then that Jobs decided to put the interests of the company before the short-term needs of the shareholders: he focused on financial sustainability and accepted a salary of 1 USD per year. Jobs made the rest of his salary dependent on Apple's performance and Apple's stock.

Jobs is considered by many to be a visionary. He flouted the rules of traditional business practices and consumption patterns and went by what he thought consumers wanted or needed. He made the technology accessible and popular with the general public and the results showed it.

He put the company on the map and created a veritable Apple cult that saw the value of Apple stock rise exponentially in a relatively short period of time.

Thus, before his death, the character of Steve Jobs was one of the hidden arguments to buy Apple shares.

# Why buying Apple stock?

If Apple was successful again from the 2000s and 2010s, it's largely due to the iPhone and iPad. These products have somehow revolutionized technological mobility. What sets these products apart from the competition is that they are authentic and add value to the consumer.

They have the particularity of being multifunctional despite the high prices. With them you can do many things, such as listening to music, watching videos, reading digital books, playing video games, surfing the Internet, watching TV, etc. In short, the iPhone and iPad allow you to potentially save on some purchases.

Apple's other strength for generating repeat business and retaining customers is its portfolio of services through iTunes for music and the App Store for free and paid apps.

Now that the iPhone and iPad have reached maturity and democratization, it will be necessary to find other arguments to buy Apple shares on the stock market since they are very dependent on the success of their products.

China and the services sector could provide a new impetus. However, in China, the Apple brand faces local competition from Xiaomi, Huawei and ZTE.

# Apple Results 2021

Apple recently announced financial results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2021 (June 26 – September 25).

The most relevant data is the following:

* ✅ Apple has entered during this period 83,360 million dollars (71,493 million euros), 28.84% more year-on-year. Nearly half of the revenue, 46.6%, comes from iPhone sales.
* ❌ Despite the improvement in results, Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out that they are below what they expected as global supply problems have negatively impacted the accounts, specifically 6 billion dollars less.
* ✅ Regarding the quarterly Earnings per Share (EPS) it reached 1.24 USD per title.
* ✅ Regarding the dividend, Apple's board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.22 per share that was paid on November 11, 2021 to shareholders.

# Long-term Apple stock analysis

Let's analyze the following chart of Apple stock to determine where the current situation is and if it is a [good time to invest](https://capexinsider.com/insider-week/?orid=30023&amp;opid=84).

https://preview.redd.it/8q9vdwhp56c91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=930c9bd8b545cd1baf45b8771b6e905dd17c9e54

Apple's stock price has seen an extraordinary stock market performance since its lowest low in March 2009, with highs regularly being broken higher.

Let's take a deeper look at 2020 and so far in 2021. Apple's stock reached an all-time high in February 2020, at $82. Nothing suggested that it could change the upward trend, at least in the short term.

However, in the following month, Apple shares fell by around 35%. What happened? It can be summed up in one word: coronavirus.

The share price, however, has recovered dramatically, rising by more than 170%. This increase is due to different events:

* ✅ Good economic performance
* ✅ Apple has become the first US company to reach a market capitalization of 2 trillion dollars
* ✅ Apple stock split 4:1

We can see how the share price begins an almost vertical upward rally from the end of March 2020, after the crash caused by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, until August. In that time Apple is revalued from 62 dollars to 121 dollars.

The stock resumes its trend in September and enters a bullish channel with setbacks and bounces at various Fibonacci levels until finally bouncing at the 61.8 level (around $142). How much is an Apple share worth now? $161 as of November 26, 2021.

Let's zoom in a bit more on the graph:

https://preview.redd.it/6d9ukh6r56c91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53a0dec84c23a889e469faa06ad04b292a8a748b

In the graph above we can see the different levels that the price of Apple shares has been exceeding and the point where it is. If we look at the Moving Averages (20, 50, 100) we can see how all three lines are bullish and continue below the price.

# Apple Stock Split

At the end of the summer of 2020, Apple announced the split of its shares of 4 for 1. What does this mean and what is it due to?

Apple is looking for new investors and the price that the stock reached before carrying out the split was around 500 dollars.

On August 31, 2020:

&gt;➤ The price of each Apple share was divided by 4 . That is, the new shares began to trade around 120 dollars. This serves to attract new investors by being a more affordable price.  
&gt;  
&gt;➤ On the other hand, those who had bought Apple shares were not affected, since even if the price is divided by 4, the number of their shares is multiplied by 4, so the total amount remains the same.

By lowering the share price, it is easier to broaden the investor base. This benefits the company's liquidity and creates more demand for its shares.

So, can we say that it was a good time to invest in Apple? Only with the announcement of the split, the shares increased their value.

In addition, now the price of these is much more accessible.

Let's look at the situation that has surrounded the company in recent years to determine if it is a good time to invest in Apple.

# Apple financial analysis

Apple's financial ratios speak for themselves. The ROE (Return on equity), that is, the return on shareholders' money, as of September 30, 2021 stands at 144.12%. As for Earnings per Share (EPS), it has been growing fiscal year after fiscal year, as we can see in the following chart:

[Data corresponds to each Apple fiscal year \(ending September 30\). Please note that past results are not a reliable indicator of future results. ](https://preview.redd.it/1cjebmkz56c91.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89242c0249283ca1ea6f47f272d00541ceabace7)

Right now, Apple is making [significant profits](https://capexinsider.com/insider-week/?orid=30023&amp;opid=84) and keeping Earnings Per Share (EPS) on an almost continuous upward trend, especially since 2016. This is good for shareholder value creation and your cash flow.

Let's see then the distribution of Apple's dividends:

https://preview.redd.it/pk6tve1766c91.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ebd998ff8309d365e86dd19d61b53252ffb20e

Since 2012, the company has been paying a dividend per share to shareholders and is committed to a financial rationale that Wall Street loves.

The dividend increases each year. This is proof that Apple is capable of creating shareholder value. It has room to be more generous with its shareholders.

At first glance, its dividend can be considered solid in the long run.

# Investing in Apple?

You may be wondering if investing or buying Apple stock right now would be a good idea. Let's summarize what we have explained above.

In terms of fundamental analysis, Apple is a long-term, high-quality company with a cash flow of more than $250 billion and enviable profitability in the technology sector.

In addition, it has the financial flexibility to work on other growth drivers to create shareholder value.

With the split of its shares, the title has become much more accessible to all investors, which can be interpreted as a positive sign.

As we can see, the price was in a very pronounced uptrend. This suggested a further correction in the price is likely to happen, a moment that has not yet arrived.

Apple has doubled both their profits and free cash flow in the last five years, and growth is still expected from this tech giant.  Just be careful at current prices - $104 per share may be a much better price.

DAX Bounces Off A Crucial Support To Enter Bear Market Territory

  


  
According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin is down 9 percent in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $9,500. Since it tested $9,700 yesterday, bitcoin has shed almost $500 on low volume. As mentioned in our earlier analysis, despite the recent decline, bitcoin is still up more than 15 percent in the last seven days.

  


  
As per the daily chart, the technical structure of bitcoin is currently at the midway mark of a falling wedge with the lower end at $9,400 and the upper end at $9,700.

  


  
Although the price has already entered below the midpoint of the wedge, the break has not triggered a bounce from the lower end of the triangle and bitcoin is currently testing a key support of $9,200.

Investors On The Ropes

  


  
This week in the blogosphere was pretty depressing. The New York Times ran a feature on the so-called “baby bust” in which parents were opting for fewer, not more, children. The Wall Street Journal’s Dorothy Rabinowitz warned that the decline in family size would leave Americans with a generation of latchkey children whose moral development was severely stunted. The cover of Bloomberg Businessweek featured the face of an angry woman with the bold headline “Don’t Be a Wuss — Have More Kids”. (We have more in common with Dorothy Rabinowitz and Bloomberg Businessweek than we’d like to admit.)

  


  
It is true that there is a cultural bias toward small families, but it is not a bias that is necessarily rooted in economic insecurity. In fact, it’s more of a psychological or emotional shift.

In a periodic transaction report, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia for about $4.1 million, ending up with a loss of $341,365.

Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies.

Transaction reports filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, show her husband bought 5,000 Nvidia shares in July 2021, and that he exercised options to buy another 20,000 Nvidia shares last June.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage in coming days of legislation providing about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The legislation, which aims to make the domestic chip industry more competitive with China's, would then be taken up in the U.S. House under Pelosi's direction.

Last year, Pelosi defended the rights of federal lawmakers to trade stocks, but she later responded to calls for a ban on trading by lawmakers by signaling willingness to potentially advance such legislation.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is most valuable U.S chipmaker.

July 27 (Reuters) — U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband sold his shares of chipmaker Nvidia [(NVDA.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/NVDA.O) on Tuesday, days before the House is expected to consider legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.

In a periodic transaction report, the senior Democrat [disclosed](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2022/20021438.pdf) that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia for about $4.1 million, ending up with a loss of $341,365.

Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple [(AAPL.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O), Microsoft [(MSFT.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O) and other tech companies.

Transaction reports filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, show her husband bought 5,000 Nvidia shares in July 2021, and that he exercised options to buy another 20,000 Nvidia shares last June.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage in coming days of legislation providing about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The legislation, which aims to make the domestic chip industry more competitive with China’s, would then be taken up in the U.S. House under Pelosi’s direction.

Last year, Pelosi defended the rights of federal lawmakers to trade stocks, but she later responded to calls for a ban on trading by lawmakers by signaling willingness to potentially advance such legislation.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

An [analysis](https://unusualwhales.com/i_am_the_senate/full) by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.

 Dow Jones futures rose Friday, looking to cap a solid weekly gain as both the Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 set sights on their fourth straight weekly advance. Tech titan Apple stock is closing in on its latest buy point, as it heads for a six-week win streak. 

On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed a 1% gain to just 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 reversed slightly lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended down 0.6%, after an early 1.3% rally found stout resistance around the 13,000 level. The Nasdaq remains higher for the week, and on track for a four-week win streak.";0;1;Raw_Rain;StockMarket;Positive;Negative;Positive

1660452563;why warren buffett loves apple stock;"After reading the book, Buffetology, I can see why Warren Buffett loves Apple stock. 

## Apple products have a massive consumer monopoly
If you raised $100 billion and hired the best people you could find, you can't exactly build a competitor that will threaten Apple's position in the market. Apple has a massive competitive advantage. Their products are in a class of their own.

## Apple has a massive ROE
Equity is the shareholder's money in the business. A very high return on equity means the company's management is doing a great job allocating shareholder's capital. Apple's ROE over the last three years was 150%, 88%, and 61%. This is similar to Warren Buffett's investment in Coca-Cola. Coke had a very high ROE and still has. 

## Apple is returning a lot of money back to shareholders
Apple has been buying back shares aggressively, reducing the number of available shares and increasing the value of shares held by current shareholders. Share buybacks reduce shareholders' equity, but this is good because the equity is returned to shareholders. In fact, Apple's equity growth rate numbers are negative because shareholders' equity has been dropping because of their aggressive buybacks.

## Apple is a cash cow
Apple is producing massive cash flow with $93 Billion in Free Cash Flow and $366 Billion in Revenue in 2021. 

## Apple has trustworthy management
Tim cook appears to be a steady hand that can be trusted.

## Is Apple a buy right now?
Apple seems almost reasonably valued today. I would wait for it to go on sale to buy. A stock with Apple's momentum will only go on sale during historical market crashes where every stock and all major indices drop big. Hard to imagine a day like that today after the bounce since the last month. But the market can flip anytime with no warning. 

I don't own any Apple stock, but I will buy it if I can get it on sale with a wide margin of safety. I like to have very high odds of making a great return.";3;0;clark_k3nt;DecodeInvesting;Positive;Positive;Positive

1660839148;dow jones futures rise: costco rival breaking out, time to bite into apple stock?;"Dow Jones futures rose modestly Thursday morning, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. 

The stock market rally pulled back Wednesday amid key resistance. The major indexes initially pared losses following the release of Fed minutes from the July 27-28 meeting, but faded again by the close.

**Apple** (**AAPL**) cleared a trendline entry, with the megacap stock technically actionable ahead of an official breakout.

Chip design firm **Synopsys** (**SNPS**) and lagging Dow Jones tech giant **Cisco Systems** (**CSCO**) reported late Wednesday. SNPS stock rose slightly and Cisco stock popped in extended action on strong earnings and guidance.

Lithium giant **Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile** (**SQM**) released mixed results very early Thursday. SQM stock fell in premarket trade.

**BJ's Wholesale** (**BJ**), a rival to **Costco Wholesale** (**COST**), beat views before the open. BJ's stock rose solidly, signaling a move above a buy point Costco is just in a buy zone.

## BBBY Stock Tumbles

Meanwhile, newly revived meme stock **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** (**BBBY**) fell more than 10% early Thursday, but well off overnight lows. BBBY stock rose 12% to 23.08 in Wednesday's session, but closed near session lows after hitting a five-month high of 30 intraday.

Shares jumped 29% in massive volume on Tuesday as **GameStop** (**GME**) Chairman Ryan Cohen disclosed he still owns BBBY stock along with significant out-of-the-money options.

But late Wednesday, Cohen disclosed his intention to completely exit BBBY stock.

GME stock, the original meme stock, retreated overnight after falling 4% Wednesday. **AMC Entertainment** (**AMC**), another meme stock, fell 14% in the regular session.

## Fed Minutes

Federal Reserve policymakers at the late July meeting agreed that further rate hikes are necessary, according to the newly released Fed minutes.

Declining commodity prices, including energy, aren't enough, according to the Fed minutes, with policymakers stressing that inflation pressures are broad-based. But they also worried about slowing the economy too much.

They didn't seem concerned that financial conditions eased since the June meeting, including lower Treasury yields and a stock market rally.

All in all, the **Fed minutes held no hawkish surprises**, slightly easing rate hike expectations.

Still, markets now see a 61.5% chance of a 50-basis-point Fed rate hike on Sept. 21. Earlier Wednesday, before the Fed minutes release, odds were about evenly divided between a half-point move or a third straight 75-basis-point move.

## Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.25%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%. CSCO stock is a member of the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite.

Crude oil futures rose 1%. Natural gas futures added nearly 2%.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 2.85%.

Remember that overnight action in **Dow futures** and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular **stock market** session.

# ETFs

Among the **best ETFs**, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (**FFTY**) fell just over 1%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (**BOUT**) shed 0.5%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (**IGV**) slumped 1.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (**SMH**) retreated 2.15%. SNPS stock is in the IGV and SMH ETFs.

SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) declined 2.7% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) sank 1.1%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) descended 2.5%. SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) shed 1.7%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) gained 0.8% and the Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) slipped 0.5%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) fell 0.6%.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (**ARKK**) tumbled 5.3% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) 5.1%.

# Apple Stock

Apple stock, a member of the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite, rose 0.9% to 174.55 on Wednesday. AAPL stock moved above a down-sloping trendline going back to early January. That offers a buying opportunity.

The official **buy point** is 183.04, according to **MarketSmith analysis**. Investors could view the Apple stock chart as an awkward **double-bottom base** with a 179.71 entry.

AAPL stock rose in volume that was slightly above normal. But most of its strong uptrend over the past two months has been on below-average trade. The tech titan could use a break. A handle would create a lower buy point and let the moving averages catch up.

 Apple stock is outperforming other megacaps and the broader market: Its **relative strength line**, the blue line in the charts provided, has been hitting record highs for a few weeks.

## Key Earnings

SQM earnings surged 871% vs. a year earlier, but still missed views. Revenue leapt 342%, beating. SQM stock fell 2% before the open. Shares dipped 1.2% to 104.42 on Wednesday after skidding 5.1% Tuesday in a downside reversal. SQM stock is working on a 115.86 cup-base buy point. Shares topped a 99.84 early entry last week from a too-low handle, but could test that area on Thursday. A proper handle would be ideal for SQM stock.

Lithium rivals **Albemarle** (**ALB**) and **Livent** (**LTHM**) both reported strong earnings earlier this month, with the industry giant Albemarle sharply raising guidance yet again. ALB and LTHM stock edged lower in premarket trade.

#  Market Rally Analysis

A day after the S&amp;P 500 stopped just short of the 200-day moving average, the major indexes pulled back Wednesday. The Fed minutes moved stocks but they ultimately closed about where they were at 2 p.m. ET.

Small caps and highly valued growth stocks were the biggest losers, but declines were broad-based outside of energy.

The Dow Jones held support at its 200-day line. The Russell 2000 undercut that key level. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have not reached it. 

The market rally has come a long way from its June lows with the 200-day line a clear resistance area. So this is an obvious time and place for the major indexes to pause or pull back.

For now, the market rally seems reluctant to cede much ground. Arguably, a bit more of a pullback would be constructive. It would let Apple and other stocks that have run up the right side of bases take a break and form handles.

But the market is going to do what it's going to do. The indexes could quickly run past the 200-day line or retreat sharply to the 50-day line, or worse.

# What to Do Now

Stocks tend to follow the market and industry trends. That's why it's so important to pay attention to the general market, adding exposure in confirmed uptrends and moving largely or entirely to cash in corrections.

With the market hitting resistance at the 200-day line, investors should wait before adding to net exposure. They could consider taking some partial profits.

But keep working on watchlists. A market pause that refreshes could create major opportunities.

I am a very passive investor, I just set and forget. I am 29 and my company offers 10% off Microsoft Stock up to 15% of my pay.

1662045607;apple stock is a buy ahead of the inflationary iphone 14 release;"Optimism on Apple's next suite of products is running high ahead of the company's Sept. 7 event.

Apple stock is up over 15% in the last two months as investors bank on higher prices for the iPhone 14 family and speculate on new augmented reality glasses from the tech giant.

""In our opinion, iPhone pricing is the main focus item for investors followed by timing and cadence of the launch and any news on pricing/bundling,"" Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a new note to clients.

Mohan is staying bullish on Apple's stock into the event next month. Here's what Mohan had to say about Apple.

* **Price Target:** $185
* **Rating:** Buy (reiterated)
* **Stock Price movement assumed:** \+16%

**What Apple's stock does around iPhone releases:**

Apple has launched a new version of the iPhone around the start of its fiscal year for the past 14 years. The stock has seen double-digit growth for many of those years and even saw triple-digit growth in fiscal year 2020.

1662051614;nvidia stock crashes 7%! getting too cheap to ignore?;"The U.S. government has just announced that chip maker Nvidia will no longer be able to sell its top technologies to China and Russia, which has sent the stock crashing over 7% in after hours trading.  It is down even further in the pre-market.  Additionally, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has sold at least $1,000,000 of the stock after public scrutiny.  Although the stock is getting more attractive, it is probably not attractive enough based on the valuation.  At over 40 times earnings, even with robust growth future returns could be impacted.  The stock will look more attractive closer to $100 per share.

1663957637;need help operating fluval spec v stock light!;"Hi everyone! 

I recently received a brand new Fluval Spec V as a gift and I can’t seem to get the stock light to work. It’s one of the new aluminum ones with the touch pad on top. 

My issue is that it’s stuck at the dim setting/night setting when I use it with the included adapter. I tried tapping the touch pad and it just won’t change. On the other hand, I tried using it with a different adapter and it was quite bright until that adapter just stopped working so I’ve swapped it out with the included adapter again. 

Am I just doing something wrong? There weren’t clear instructions for how to adjust it and I’m getting a little frustrated, especially after watching video after video. I’ve contacted Fluval customer service for help but I figured I’d reach out to the community on here just in case they’re missing something. Thank you so much in advance!";1;0;revolutionaryboredom;Aquariums;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1664892013;"apple stock: big problems for aapl stock? latest supplier news &amp; valuation update!";"Apple holds the smartphone world in its hands, at least in the United States.  Market share has exceeded those of other brands, making iPhones officially the most popular brand in the U.S. over Android-based devices.  Signs of demand weakness cause the stock to dip a bit, but this reduction in demand is primarily for Apple's lower and mid-priced models.  

The iPhone 14 Pro is still seeing high demand, calming investors that the company will be able to continue to sell more units at higher prices.  Although results from the most recent quarter were mixed, the services side of the business continues to grow at a steady double digit clip, adding more to the bottom line since service revenue has much higher margins than product revenue.  

The stock could return a good amount of money to shareholders from this price point, but tread cautiously because of the current valuation.

The company, which has struggled in the face of competition from TikTok and changes in Apple's ad practices, is pivoting toward investment in artificial intelligence and monetization of Instagram Reels.  

Although the ad market is likely to struggle in the short term (especially if we are nearing a recession) Meta still looks like a long term buy, and its forward P/E ratio of 14 still looks attractive.

I want you to look at this chart. And to see how ridiculous this market just is. Basically earnings are just there to totally destroy the direction of a stock. First of all, as whatever happens, there will be a gap, which has to be closed in order to continue trading at its normal price.   
The more the market is approaching its end days, the more stupid the charts look.   


Some other stocks do the same thing, but this one was really stupid. There are no winners except marketmakers who write options and leveraged contracts: Shorts &amp; longs  
So no matter what the company has said, no matter what revenue they have reported, nothing of this matters. What matters to marketmakers is, how to steal as much money from somebody else and maximize profit.   
This stock went from 130 to 144 in one second with a float of 2.4billion shares, dumped down the very next second to 115 and creeped lower down while liquidating more shorts in a single minute candle.  
It should be illegal and I think earnings should be reported during markethours so all people have the opportunity to trade and not just some individuals and institutions.  
And I honestly dont know why things like this gets just tolerated. It has nothing to do with trading, it has nothing to do with investing, it has nothing to do with helping a company grow. It is just about stealing money and then the country in the end is still in debt and I have no idea what the hell they are all doing with that money. We saw it over the last 2 years with GME this bullshit, but its all across the market. GME is just standing out and has more eyes on it than other stocks.  
I dont know, maybe Im stupid and I dont understand, but stuff like this is in my opinion very shit and people who do that should be in jail and never handle financials ever again, its like a mafia.  


To note:  
GME has a tiny float compared to this one and half of it is directly registered.  
This gives just confidence that once things get out of hand, GME can explode to the upside like no stock before. You see here on the chart how fast that goes, in the algorithm world the algo doesnt care which direction it is, its all some maths and code and its doing just its things, the direction doesnt matter. And surely it doesnt matter who buys or sells. Its all made up and all data is wrong and news coverage are based on assumptions and lies and excuses to justify this price action.  
And people who know about this and have some power, dont care. Because they get money to not care. They are too corrupt to do the right thing. They have estabilished a SEC, a security that looks away when crime happens instead to react. It baffles me how nobody is doing anything.  
This manipulation has costed companies money. Costed jobs, costed peoples futures and lives.   
We need a reset, a total reset and kick out all the shitheads out of our world that make us stay in one place while wondering r if we have enough money to pay the bills tomorrow.";7;2;xLuminus;ddorgtfo;Negative;Positive;Neutral

1666871435;why is meta stock tanking? 'the wrong number at the wrong time,' analyst explains;"Investors in Meta stock wanted to hear one thing on the embattled company's earnings call late Wednesday: an acknowledgement by founder Mark Zuckerberg that leaner spending times were ahead as margins have been squeezed by an ill-timed metaverse build out and a slowing ad market.

They heard the opposite.

The social media platform outlined about 13% year-over-year expense growth for fiscal year 2023, well above the Street's forecast of 7%. Meta will clearly continue to spend aggressively — despite the prospects of a 2023 U.S. recession — on Instagram, the metaverse, and VR hardware.

""With a new CFO in place, some may argue the company is being overly conservative,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black wrote in a note to clients, ""and while Meta typically lowers \[operating expenditure\] guidance throughout the year (as they did so far year to date), the elevated expense outlook is the wrong number at the wrong time for investors. Perhaps just as importantly, growing Reality Labs (RL) expenses appear to be one source of the elevated expense guide as RL operating losses are expected to grow significantly year over year in 2023.""

Meta shares crashed more than 20% in pre-market trading on Thursday. The ticker was atop the ""[Top Trending](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)"" section on the Yahoo Finance platform.

Here is how Meta [performed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-thid-quarter-earnings-130316557.html) in the third quarter, which disappointed investors:

* **Revenue**: $27.7 billion versus $27.4 billion expected
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: $1.64 versus $1.89 expected
* **Facebook Daily Active Users (DAUs):** 1.98 billion versus 1.86 billion expected
* **Facebook Monthly Active Users (MAUs):** 2.96 billion versus 2.97 expected
* **Reality Labs operating loss:** $3.67 billion versus $3.09 billion expected

The company's outlook also wasn't very good. Meta's fourth quarter revenue guidance came in between $30 billion and $32.5 billion while Wall Street was expecting $32.2 billion.

The House of Zuck also announced that it will be pacing Reality Lab investments beyond 2023, but that spending will be significantly higher next year.";6;11;Sunsmiling;wallstreetbets;Negative;Neutral;Negative

* Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.
* “Sometimes in-line results are most exciting,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.

If it holds until the close, it’ll be the best day for Apple shares since April 2020. Apple was the second-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones behind Intel on Friday.

The surge comes after a mixed week of Big Tech earnings, in which Meta and Alphabet

 showed signs of weakness caused by macroeconomic conditions hurting the digital ad market. Alphabet rose less than 3% and Meta was up less than 1%.on Friday. Both took big hits earlier in the week.

Amazon fell 9% on Friday after giving weak guidance for the holiday quarter.

Although Apple signaled some slowing growth in the current quarter, and weakness in its profitable service business, analysts were generally positive about the company’s results.

Apple grew sales by 8% during the September quarter, keeping its pandemic quarterly growth streak alive.

Apple’s Mac business grew 25% even as PC sales from other brands from around the world fell.

And Apple signaled that demand for premium computers and phones remains strong.

While Apple’s results weren’t much stronger than what Wall Street expected, the company increasingly looks like a safe haven for investors seeking quality stocks to weather a potential recession as interest rates rise.

“Sometimes in-line results are most exciting,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

He said the resilience in Apple’s quarter was noteworthy because the company continues to grow sales even against tough macroeconomic factors like a strong dollar, all while keeping its margins high.

Although the results were only slightly higher than expectations, it was still noteworthy since the company continues to grow sales and kept margins high amid tough macroeconomic conditions. Apple’s sales grew by 8% and their macbook business grew by 25%, while sales from other brands around the world have dropped. This shows that demand for their products remains strong. Shares of Apple’s big tech peers such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have all plunged after reporting weaker results.

1667138287;apple stock price targets cut by analysts following q4 earnings;"#### Key points:

* [Apple ](https://www.asktraders.com/learn-to-trade/trading-guide/three-day-trading-strategies-apple-stocks/)reported Q3 results after the close Thursday
* Its shares ate up premarket
* Analysts have cut price targets, but remain bullish

[Apple ](https://www.asktraders.com/learn-to-trade/stock-trading/how-to-buy-apple-shares/)(NASDAQ: AAPL) reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, which beat Wall Street expectations.

The company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, an 8% increase year over year. In addition, the group posted quarterly earnings per share of $1.29, above expectations of $1.17. However, the tech giant reported iPhone revenue of $42.63 billion, below forecasts of $43.21 billion.

Apple shares are trading up 0.5% premarket. 

The firm also declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on November 10.

Following its Q4 results, several Wall Street analysts cut their price targets for Apple.

Baird analyst, William Power, lowered its price target to $170 from $185 but kept an Outperform rating. The analyst was encouraged by the strong demand trends despite the macro environment, but lowered his full-year revenue estimate to reflect the increasing FX impact.

Citi analyst Jim Suva trimmed the firm’s price target on Apple to $175 from $185, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Suva told investors in a note that he believes shoppers will adjust spending allocations and continue to purchase Apple’s growing platform of products and services.

KeyBanc’s Brandon Nispel reduced the firm’s price target on Apple shares to $177 from $185, maintaining an Overweight rating. Nispel stated Apple’s hardware revenue topped expectations, driven by better Mac and Wearables, while iPhone was in line and iPad was below consensus.

Elsewhere, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee labelled Apple’s performance in the quarter as resilient, with iPhone revenue still constrained by supply and services challenged by currency and macro headwinds. Chatterjee said Apple’s “resilience to a tough macro through the mix of Products and Services is likely to drive a re-rating.” Chatterjee tells investors in a research note. Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on Apple with a $200 price target.";1;0;Asktraders178;asktraders12;Positive;Neutral;Neutral

The cloud and productivity segments are still growing quite fast, while the personal computing division seems to be shrinking a bit.  

Overall, the company should deliver low double digit revenue growth for the full fiscal year.  There are many bright spots for the company, such as LinkedIn growing to over 875 million users and the company buying back a lot of its stock over time.  

While this stock may beat the market, it is unlikely to be a multibagger at this point because of its current valuation, sitting at around 27 times free cash flow, and 24 times earnings.

November 2, 2022 – TheNewswire - Victoria , Canada –– Teuton Resources Corp.  (“Teuton” or “the Company”) (TSXV:TUO) (OTC:TEUTF) (Frankfurt:TFE) announces that, in conformance with its 2022 Stock Option Plan, the Company has granted to certain directors and investment relations personnel, options to purchase 2,050,000 shares of the Company at a price of $1.17 per share, exercisable until November 2, 2027.   The new grants are subject to the policies of the TSX-V Stock Exchange.   The 2022 stock option plan is a fixed, less than or equal to 10% plan.

About Teuton

Teuton owns interests in more than thirty properties in the prolific “Golden Triangle” area of northwest British Columbia and was one of the first companies to adopt what has since become known as the “prospect generator” model.  This model minimizes share equity dilution while at the same time maximizing opportunity.  Earnings provided from option payments  (received in cash and often also in shares of the optionee companies), has provided Teuton with substantial income over the years.

Respectfully submitted,

""Dino Cremonese, P.Eng.""

1667751796;meta stock analysis and valuation - is michael burry right?;"This week's casual valuation is Meta (formerly known as Facebook), a company that's down almost 50% over the last 5 years and over 75% since its all-time high back in September 2021.

As always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into a few segments:

1. What is Meta?
2. How to value Meta?
3. Historical financial performance and assumptions about the future
4. Valuation
5. Is Reality Labs that bad?
6. The different scenarios

**What is Meta?**

Meta doesn't really need any introduction, everyone knows their main products (Facebook/Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp), but what caused the decline in recent years is the change of their vision from these apps (that are known as ""Family of Apps"") to the metaverse idea (known as ""Reality Labs"").

**How to value Meta?**

Since one of the goals of this post is to value Meta, the question is, how to value these two operating segments?

The ""Family of Apps"" is the cash-generating machine, and there's a decade of financial data available to understand how it has performed when it comes to revenue and operating margin.

However, the second part is what brings the uncertainty in here. Regardless of the model used to value the ""Reality Labs"", the inputs/variables are too uncertain to create anything that's reasonable.

For that reason, I decided to take a different approach. I'll value the mature segment, the ""Family of Apps"" and compare that with the current market cap to understand what the market thinks of the metaverse and how much it prices it at.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's get started!

**Historical financial performance &amp; assumptions about the future**

Over the last 5 years, the ""Family of Apps"" grew revenue over 100% to over $115b for the last twelve months (ending September 2022). The operating margin of over 40% has been nothing but impressive.

Looking at the analysts' forecasts, they're expecting the revenue to grow around 5% during 2023 and over 10% during 2024. I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period.

However, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high.

When it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&amp;D being poured in.

Using a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of ""Family of Apps"" is around **$417b**.

**Valuation**

Now, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine ""Family of Apps"".

But there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied.

If the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**.

The current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea.

Is something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran:

""If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook &amp; complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian &amp; whining about your privacy being invaded.""

**So, what can be done?**

Well, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option.

**Is Reality labs that bad?**

This is a question that will be answered a decade from now.

Mark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the ""Family of Apps"".

So, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly.

Since 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment.

**The Michael Burry tweet**

The great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many.

One of his tweets was, ""Seems Meta has a New Coke problem."". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted.

I wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means.

Back in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was ""smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour"". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi.

What followed was 5,000 angry phone calls  per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year.

This means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.

Could he be wrong? Absolutely!

There's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the ""Reality Labs"" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not.

**The different scenarios**

What if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the ""Reality Labs"" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point.

What if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today.

As for me, I have 1 share in Meta, just to be entertained by what's coming next.";77;88;k_ristovski;ValueInvesting;Positive;Positive;Positive

1668436212;should investors buy apple stock right now?;"Apple stock has seen a slump just like the rest of the market, but it has not fallen nearly as much as many other stocks.  

The business faces some challenges as iPhones, which make up 40% of the company's sales, are experiencing slower growth, and there is fear that in a recession, consumers will wait longer to upgrade their devices.  

One aspect of the business countering this slowdown is the rapid growth of the company's subscription and service revenue.  

Although Apple share's don't look undervalued from a short term perspective at 22 times forward earnings, in the long run, the company's stock is likely to perform well.

1668609014;mastercard stock - dcf valuation and analysis;"Mastercard stock has performed well over a long period of time, but has been relatively sideways and on somewhat of a downtrend in recent months.  When performing a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis on a stock, we can use historical numbers in the business's financial statements in order to predict future performance of the business, and thus see if the stock is undervalued or overvalued.

With assumptions that revenue will grow in the mid double digits, gross margins will stay elevated at 78%, and the company has a weighted cost of capital at 9%, the intrinsic value of the shares in the present is around $279.  

This falls far below the current share price, indicating the business is likely overvalued at this time.

Growth should return by 2024 as the company matures the monetization of some of its products and services.  For example, Instagram Reels will begin monetization next year, and Reality Labs revenue continues to grow.  Don't count Meta out just yet, especially at the stock's current valuation.

1669732209;apple stock: bet against it? china riots!;"The current political climate in China has some investors nervous.  Foxconn, one of the world's largest manufacturers, which is located in China, has been have trouble with protests from its workers.  The business is responsible for producing massive amounts of iPhones, but many workers, who are living in terrible living conditions, have started rioting because of conflicts with the government's policy regarding Covid-19.  Even a foreign journalist was beaten by police in the street.  

What does this mean for Apple investors?  The company is still exceptional, but management will sooner or later have to address this situation, especially considering the fact that 98% of iPhones are produced by Chinese contractors.  Talks of diversity, equity, and inclusion can only go so far without commensurate action.  

The current valuation of the stock at around 24 times forward earnings is not incredibly expensive, but given the risks of the business right now there does not seem like a good risk to reward ratio in order to buy shares (though shorting the stock may not be a good decision either).

1669820416;meta stock - you buying the dip? facebook stock analysis;"Meta stock has come down significantly from previously seen levels, and offers what appears to be a good buying opportunity for long term investors.  

The business is now trading at just eight times forward earnings, with tens of billions of dollars in cash on its balance sheet and no net debt.  Although there are concerns about the significant drop in the company's operating margins, this business is still highly profitable and should return to growth in a few years.  

It has the financial capacity to weather out the storm, and even buy back shares at these prices if management so desires.  With just modest growth going forward, we should expect high returns from this stock, primarily because the valuation multiple has been punished so heavily.

1670596212;time to buy nvidia stock? nvda stock price december 2022;"NVIDIA is working hard to be the undisputed leader in the chip market, and go beyond its traditional market of creating world-class GPUs for computer systems.  

The company recently announced they are teaming up with Microsoft to build an AI cloud computer, which is helping further the businesses' vision for computing overall.  Out of the top ten supercomputers in the world, NVIDIA has created five of them.  

Add to this the growing markets for the company in the autonomous vehicle space as well as with data centers, the future looks bright for NVIDIA and its stock.  The current downtrend in the stock reflects investors' hesitancy with the current consumer market headwinds, but this trend seems temporary.

1671028212;why you should buy microsoft stock now | msft stock review;"The king of productivity software, Microsoft, continues to hold great promise as a long-term investment.  While its stock price, including those of many other tech names, has been falling this year, it may be a great opportunity to purchase shares in an outstanding company.  

Microsoft's dividend is small at just around a 1% yield, but it has been growing this dividend at around 11% annually, in addition to consistently reducing its share count through buybacks.  What's more, the growth story of this company is far from over.  

Even with nearly $200 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year, its largest segments of cloud software and productivity subscriptions, are growing fast.  This has led the company overall to make 18% more revenue in the past year.  Add to this high growth segments like LinkedIn (revenue up 35% year over year), and you have a recipe for an even more powerful and profitable technology business.

1671197623;5 reasons why meta stock just caught a rare upgrade;"Meta's stock has had a disastrous year in large part because the underlying company has had a disastrous year headlined by sweeping layoffs, weakening ad sales, and poor execution by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

But the stock caught one believer on Friday finally headed into the New Year.

""Heading into 2023, we believe some of these top and bottom line pressures will ease, and most importantly, Meta is showing encouraging signs of increasing cost discipline, we believe with more to come,"" said JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a new client note.

Anmuth lifted his rating to overweight (out-perform equivalent) from neutral. He sees fair value for Meta at $150, up from $115 previously.

Meta shares rose 1.5% to $117 in pre-market trading. The stock has crashed about 65% year to date, making the worst-performing component of the closely tracked FAANG (Meta/Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex.

Here are the five drivers of Anmuth's Meta upgrade:

**1)** Better cost controls by management on both total expenses and capital expenditures.

**2)** Lessening sales impact from Apple iOS privacy changes.

**3)** The company stands to compete more effectively against surging rival TikTok.

**4)** Reels monetization may gain steam and become ""at least"" neutral to sales in later 2023.

**5)** Valuation on the stock is ""compelling"" after the steep 2022 drop.

1671598491;why apple stock is outperforming other tech stocks like amazon, meta, and meta;"In recent months, Apple has suffered one setback after another. Apple is anticipated to lose out on the sale of millions of iPhones this holiday season, which is the company's most crucial period of the year, due to labour unrest and production halts at Foxconn Technology Group's enormous iPhone plant in central China.

The majority of economists believe that a worldwide recession will start up in the next year, which will decrease consumer demand for the pricey products that Apple offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Technology companies have particularly lost popularity as central banks quickly boost interest rates to control inflation. Apple stock has lost close to $800 billion this year, or roughly one-fourth of its market worth.

In the meantime, Apple's App Store policies are coming under more antitrust investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Bloomberg News, the corporation is getting ready for the severe EU regulations that will take effect in 2024 by allowing apps from other sources to run on its iPhones and iPads.

&amp;#x200B;

That development would encourage the US and other nations to adopt similar policies as the EU, endangering the $23 billion in revenue experts predict the App Store will bring in for the company during its current fiscal year, which ends in September.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that is bad news. And yet, as of Dec. 16, Apple is significantly outperforming rival tech behemoths whose shares have plummeted this year on the stock market.

[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. has decreased by 47%, Meta Platforms Inc. has lost 64% of its value, and Apple has decreased by 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

With its enormous earnings as a starting point, Apple's performance can be explained.

&amp;#x200B;

With a market value of $2.1 trillion, Apple is the most valuable corporation in the world, therefore it should come as no surprise that it generates more profit than any other S&amp;P 500 company.

&amp;#x200B;

What it does with those earnings is where it really stands out in the eyes of investors.

&amp;#x200B;

The corporation has generated $454 billion in cash from operations during the last five years. Apple has returned all of that money—and then some—to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks rather than investing those revenues in the purchases of prestigious firms.

That is greater than the market worth of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or Exxon Mobil Corp. Apple opted not to respond.

The founder and chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners LLC, an asset management firm that owns Apple shares, Kimberly Forrest, claims that Apple could have done everything that the bankers wanted them to do—buy Netflix and Disney. Instead, they exercised restraint, gave back funds to shareholders, and were rewarded as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Expectations for Apple's future profitability also contribute to the stock's robust performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Although Wall Street experts anticipate a 2% increase in Apple's profit in 2023, 2023 earnings predictions for the IT industry have been declining.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, combined earnings for tech companies in the S&amp;P 500 are anticipated to decline by about 2%.

&amp;#x200B;

Another element is the devoted following of Apple customers.

&amp;#x200B;

More than a billion iPhones are in use, and many users also own iPads, Mac laptops, and watches, among other items from the Apple family.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple has what is referred to as a ""sticky"" platform when combined with an expanding number of services, such as cloud storage and apps linked to those devices.

Apple's App Store practises resulted in a court in Paris fining the company more than EUR 1 million.

According to Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group LLC, which owns Apple shares, ""it's hard to unplug yourself if you've acquired a number of Apple goods and services, and they all operate together.""

&amp;#x200B;

Because they can't get an iPhone this month, many don't switch to Android. They will wait one month. There won't be any change in such conduct.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Benowitz, Apple has also profited from predictions that its wealthy clients will be better able to continue purchasing its products even during a recession.

These presumptions are being examined. According to Bloomberg News, Foxconn's Zhengzhou assembly plant's worker unrest will probably cause a production shortfall of close to 6 million iPhone Pro units this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Others are even more negative; Ming-Chi Kuo, a well-known analyst at TF International Securities Group Ltd., forecasted that Apple may run out of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max handsets in the holiday quarter by as many as 20 million units.

&amp;#x200B;

He also cautioned that a slowing economy could result in a decline in demand for the devices, which can cost up to $1,599.

On December 15, Foxconn announced that most anti-Covid-19 rules at its Zhengzhou factory, where the majority of iPhone Pro devices are put together, are being relaxed.

&amp;#x200B;

The corporation had forced employees to spend weeks living in isolation with inadequate food rations in order to stop a Covid outbreak and maintain production, sparking violent protests.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Foxconn, labour unrest has been ""taken under control"" and the factory is progressively returning to regular production capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the abrupt change in China's Covid Zero policies could result in an increase in hospital admissions and cases, causing further additional disruptions.

Apple has detractors. The Baron Opportunity Fund's vice president and portfolio manager, Michael Lippert, sees an overvalued IT giant whose days of explosive expansion and ground-breaking inventions are finished.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the invention of the iPhone, when has there been a truly spectacular innovation? Lippert queries. With each new release, ""it simply gets a little bit better,"" he claims.

&amp;#x200B;

Numerous investors disagree, as demonstrated by Apple's performance this year. According to Sameer Bhasin, a principal at Value Point Capital, they are willing to pay more for a sizable company whose profits are anticipated to be immune from an economic slowdown.

15% of the richest people on earth are all under their control, he claims. ""I don't know what other company has it in this market where you have a lock on that customer base.""
