1664892013,apple stock: big problems for aapl stock? latest supplier news &amp; valuation update!,"Apple holds the smartphone world in its hands, at least in the United States.  Market share has exceeded those of other brands, making iPhones officially the most popular brand in the U.S. over Android-based devices.  Signs of demand weakness cause the stock to dip a bit, but this reduction in demand is primarily for Apple's lower and mid-priced models.  

The iPhone 14 Pro is still seeing high demand, calming investors that the company will be able to continue to sell more units at higher prices.  Although results from the most recent quarter were mixed, the services side of the business continues to grow at a steady double digit clip, adding more to the bottom line since service revenue has much higher margins than product revenue.  

The stock could return a good amount of money to shareholders from this price point, but tread cautiously because of the current valuation.

The company, which has struggled in the face of competition from TikTok and changes in Apple's ad practices, is pivoting toward investment in artificial intelligence and monetization of Instagram Reels.  

Although the ad market is likely to struggle in the short term (especially if we are nearing a recession) Meta still looks like a long term buy, and its forward P/E ratio of 14 still looks attractive.

Eu tamb√©m fiquei deitado √† sombra mas noutro lugar ao p√© do meu outro amigo. Enquanto estou a olhar pro c√©u vejo uma figura azul (um pouco mais escura que o c√©u) a passar numa linha reta em cima de n√≥s. Eu aponto para ela e digo ao meu amigo que deve ser um sat√©lite ou at√© a ISS. Ele acha que estou a apontar para um avi√£o que estava no horizonte e n√≥s discutimos se aquilo √© ou n√£o um sat√©lite. Eu aponto de novo para a figura desconhecida e ele afinal tamb√©m a consegue ver. N√≥s ficamos uns 30 segundos fixados na figura azul at√© eu decidir tirar uma foto e olho para baixo para deslizar o ecr√£ do telem√≥vel. Quando olho para cima outra vez a figura desapareceu e oi√ßo o meu amigo a dizer 'woah'. Ele diz que a figura brilhou at√© ficar branca e que depois disso a figura tinha desaparecido.

Algu√©m sabe o que √© que n√≥s vimos? Epa eu n√£o sou o maior acreditador em alien√≠genas mas este fenomeno foi um bocado anormal. 

A figura era azul e tinha um pouco de reflexo do sol na ponta da frente. Tinha uma forma oval/cil√≠ndrica e n√£o era muito maior que o di√¢metro da lua.",2,26,DidasMig,portugal

I want you to look at this chart. And to see how ridiculous this market just is. Basically earnings are just there to totally destroy the direction of a stock. First of all, as whatever happens, there will be a gap, which has to be closed in order to continue trading at its normal price.   
The more the market is approaching its end days, the more stupid the charts look.   


Some other stocks do the same thing, but this one was really stupid. There are no winners except marketmakers who write options and leveraged contracts: Shorts &amp; longs  
So no matter what the company has said, no matter what revenue they have reported, nothing of this matters. What matters to marketmakers is, how to steal as much money from somebody else and maximize profit.   
This stock went from 130 to 144 in one second with a float of 2.4billion shares, dumped down the very next second to 115 and creeped lower down while liquidating more shorts in a single minute candle.  
It should be illegal and I think earnings should be reported during markethours so all people have the opportunity to trade and not just some individuals and institutions.  
And I honestly dont know why things like this gets just tolerated. It has nothing to do with trading, it has nothing to do with investing, it has nothing to do with helping a company grow. It is just about stealing money and then the country in the end is still in debt and I have no idea what the hell they are all doing with that money. We saw it over the last 2 years with GME this bullshit, but its all across the market. GME is just standing out and has more eyes on it than other stocks.  
I dont know, maybe Im stupid and I dont understand, but stuff like this is in my opinion very shit and people who do that should be in jail and never handle financials ever again, its like a mafia.  


To note:  
GME has a tiny float compared to this one and half of it is directly registered.  
This gives just confidence that once things get out of hand, GME can explode to the upside like no stock before. You see here on the chart how fast that goes, in the algorithm world the algo doesnt care which direction it is, its all some maths and code and its doing just its things, the direction doesnt matter. And surely it doesnt matter who buys or sells. Its all made up and all data is wrong and news coverage are based on assumptions and lies and excuses to justify this price action.  
And people who know about this and have some power, dont care. Because they get money to not care. They are too corrupt to do the right thing. They have estabilished a SEC, a security that looks away when crime happens instead to react. It baffles me how nobody is doing anything.  
This manipulation has costed companies money. Costed jobs, costed peoples futures and lives.   
We need a reset, a total reset and kick out all the shitheads out of our world that make us stay in one place while wondering r if we have enough money to pay the bills tomorrow.",7,2,xLuminus,ddorgtfo

1666871435,"why is meta stock tanking? 'the wrong number at the wrong time,' analyst explains"," 

Investors in Meta stock wanted to hear one thing on the embattled company's earnings call late Wednesday: an acknowledgement by founder Mark Zuckerberg that leaner spending times were ahead as margins have been squeezed by an ill-timed metaverse build out and a slowing ad market.

They heard the opposite.

The social media platform outlined about 13% year-over-year expense growth for fiscal year 2023, well above the Street's forecast of 7%. Meta will clearly continue to spend aggressively ‚Äî despite the prospects of a 2023 U.S. recession ‚Äî on Instagram, the metaverse, and VR hardware.

""With a new CFO in place, some may argue the company is being overly conservative,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black wrote in a note to clients, ""and while Meta typically lowers \[operating expenditure\] guidance throughout the year (as they did so far year to date), the elevated expense outlook is the wrong number at the wrong time for investors. Perhaps just as importantly, growing Reality Labs (RL) expenses appear to be one source of the elevated expense guide as RL operating losses are expected to grow significantly year over year in 2023.""

Meta shares crashed more than 20% in pre-market trading on Thursday. The ticker was atop the ""[Top Trending](https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers)"" section on the Yahoo Finance platform.

Here is how Meta [performed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-thid-quarter-earnings-130316557.html) in the third quarter, which disappointed investors:

* **Revenue**: $27.7 billion versus $27.4 billion expected
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: $1.64 versus $1.89 expected
* **Facebook Daily Active Users (DAUs):** 1.98 billion versus 1.86 billion expected
* **Facebook Monthly Active Users (MAUs):** 2.96 billion versus 2.97 expected
* **Reality Labs operating loss:** $3.67 billion versus $3.09 billion expected

The company's outlook also wasn't very good. Meta's fourth quarter revenue guidance came in between $30 billion and $32.5 billion while Wall Street was expecting $32.2 billion.

The House of Zuck also announced that it will be pacing Reality Lab investments beyond 2023, but that spending will be significantly higher next year.",6,11,Sunsmiling,wallstreetbets

* Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.
* ‚ÄúSometimes in-line results are most exciting,‚Äù wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

Apple stock rose over 7% on Friday after reporting September quarter earnings that modestly beat expectations on revenue and profit and showed global demand for its premium hardware remains high.

If it holds until the close, it‚Äôll be the best day for Apple shares since April 2020. Apple was the second-best-performing stock in the Dow Jones behind Intel on Friday.

The surge comes after a mixed week of Big Tech earnings, in which Meta and Alphabet

 showed signs of weakness caused by macroeconomic conditions hurting the digital ad market. Alphabet rose less than 3% and Meta was up less than 1%.on Friday. Both took big hits earlier in the week.

Amazon fell 9% on Friday after giving weak guidance for the holiday quarter.

Although Apple signaled some slowing growth in the current quarter, and weakness in its profitable service business, analysts were generally positive about the company‚Äôs results.

Apple grew sales by 8% during the September quarter, keeping its pandemic quarterly growth streak alive.

Apple‚Äôs Mac business grew 25% even as PC sales from other brands from around the world fell.

And Apple signaled that demand for premium computers and phones remains strong.

While Apple‚Äôs results weren‚Äôt much stronger than what Wall Street expected, the company increasingly looks like a safe haven for investors seeking quality stocks to weather a potential recession as interest rates rise.

‚ÄúSometimes in-line results are most exciting,‚Äù wrote JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note on Friday.

He said the resilience in Apple‚Äôs quarter was noteworthy because the company continues to grow sales even against tough macroeconomic factors like a strong dollar, all while keeping its margins high.

1667138287,apple stock price targets cut by analysts following q4 earnings," 

#### Key points:

* [Apple ](https://www.asktraders.com/learn-to-trade/trading-guide/three-day-trading-strategies-apple-stocks/)reported Q3 results after the close Thursday
* Its shares ate up premarket
* Analysts have cut price targets, but remain bullish

[Apple ](https://www.asktraders.com/learn-to-trade/stock-trading/how-to-buy-apple-shares/)(NASDAQ: AAPL) reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, which beat Wall Street expectations.

The company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, an 8% increase year over year. In addition, the group posted quarterly earnings per share of $1.29, above expectations of $1.17. However, the tech giant reported iPhone revenue of $42.63 billion, below forecasts of $43.21 billion.

Apple shares are trading up 0.5% premarket. 

The firm also declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on November 10.

Following its Q4 results, several Wall Street analysts cut their price targets for Apple.

Baird analyst, William Power, lowered its price target to $170 from $185 but kept an Outperform rating. The analyst was encouraged by the strong demand trends despite the macro environment, but lowered his full-year revenue estimate to reflect the increasing FX impact.

Citi analyst Jim Suva trimmed the firm‚Äôs price target on Apple to $175 from $185, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Suva told investors in a note that he believes shoppers will adjust spending allocations and continue to purchase Apple‚Äôs growing platform of products and services.

KeyBanc‚Äôs Brandon Nispel reduced the firm‚Äôs price target on Apple shares to $177 from $185, maintaining an Overweight rating. Nispel stated Apple‚Äôs hardware revenue topped expectations, driven by better Mac and Wearables, while iPhone was in line and iPad was below consensus.

Elsewhere, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee labelled Apple‚Äôs performance in the quarter as resilient, with iPhone revenue still constrained by supply and services challenged by currency and macro headwinds. Chatterjee said Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúresilience to a tough macro through the mix of Products and Services is likely to drive a re-rating.‚Äù Chatterjee tells investors in a research note. Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on Apple with a $200 price target.",1,0,Asktraders178,asktraders12
