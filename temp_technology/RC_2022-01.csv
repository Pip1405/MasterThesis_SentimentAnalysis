1641023640,"mutual funds usually only do that thru captial gains, not purely the value returned by the companies they own, unless they own companies that have little or negative growth. those gains are either irrational prices (short term), decreasing risk, lower interest rates, or earnings growth. i was not saying what apple‚Äôs current total return with capital gains was, but rather what apple directly paid to shareholders in dividends + buybacks. much of apple‚Äôs recent runup is due to interest rate drops, so banking that as a gain isn‚Äôt really appropriate. 

sustainable long term capital gains are only the result of a company‚Äôs ability to pay out some risk% above the going interest rates, with apple being about as safe as it can get yet paid out about market average.  

interest rates being so low is why apple stock is so expensive. if interest rates were 5% apple would probably be worth about 70% less. with interest rates as low as they are there is little paying that well this safe, and future growth means that future returns will be higher. if you bought apple the last time there p/e was 37 (2007) and held to today, apple would have just paid you 108% of your initial investment in buybacks + dividends this year. i severely doubt growth will be anywhere near those levels, but given current interest rates and moderate growth, and the low risk of apple that return is reasonable. the whole point of lower interest rates is to make saving less enticing and encourage spending, and affects the returns of all savings vehicles. 

leveraged property returns will probably be higher‚Ä¶. but they are literally leveraged so that‚Äôs a given. there are cash needs to continue financing that and much higher risks.",1,,Olorin_1990,0

the vast vast majority of stock trades operate in the secondary market. when you buy aapl, then money goes to the person who holds the apple stock, not to apple itself. apple likely sold the stock you're buying 40 years ago.

but preferring long term profits over short term is already happening. if you check microsoft's proxy statement from 2021 you will see that the ceo's annual salary is only 7,2% of his total compensation. cash insentive (yearly bonus) was only 21,4%. over 70% of the ceo's salary came from long term incentives. 21,4% was from microsoft stock and a whopping 50% came from performance stock award. they are stocks awarded for three year performance with dynamic metrics. for 2021 it included commercial cloud revenue, commercial cloud subscribers and ""teams"" monthly active usage among others.

microsoft ceo's awarded stocks are given over 4 year period. it insentivices the ceo to make decisions that keep the stock going up, instead of only focusing in the next financial year or financial quarter. obviously we are far from a perfect solution, but long term over short term is happening, albeit slowly.

1641172798,"i think pretty much everyone loses $ early on.  i was pretty unhappy after the dotcom crash, as my trading in individual stocks resulted in losses of about 66-70% to my taxable accounts.  the s&amp;p500 index funds and etfs i had in 401(k) and iras took a 35-40% hit, and those were supposedly ""safe"" investments, because they didn't include the dotcom stocks.  

looking back, i now consider it ""tuition"" for learning about the markets.  

i have some small bets on companies that i think have a chance of making it big even though they're currently disfavored.  palantir (pltr) is one of those companies.  the stock has taken a beating, down to $18.24 from an ath of $45.  however, palantir has very strong finances (zero debt, 2.5 billion in liquid assets, and adjusted free cash flow of 300-400 million/year), the company's software platform has unique capabilities with broad applicability to industries of all types, and i think there's a chance they could scale their business much faster than anyone expects.  if they even approach half of faang status, i think investors could realize a 20-25x gain over the next 10 years, although nothing is guaranteed.  

genomics and synthetic biology are technologies that i see as possibly maturing in the 2030's.  i've used arkg (ark genomics etf) because the field is still relatively new and i don't know which companies will emerge the winners.  i've also invested a tiny amount in ginkgo bioworks (dna), which is another high-risk, speculative play.  this company is developing a platform to program cells as if they were software.  dna is a much, much riskier bet than pltr, since palantir's products generate significant revenue today, while ginkgo's products have yet to reach that stage.

**most of the capital i've earned actually went into index funds and etfs.**  they are boring, but tend to grow steadily and act as a shock absorber to my more volatile holdings. 

my initial bet on tsla was modest.  only about 7-8% of my entire portfolio in 2011.  tsla is now about 80% of my portfolio, even though i kept shoveling $ into index funds during the bull market of the past decade.  

i observed from the example of aapl that just a modest bet on a possibly game changing company would be enough.  aapl was trading at about $0.33/share when steve jobs introduced the first ipod in october 2001.  by october 2011, aapl was trading in the $14-15 range and then had a local peak in the $24-25 range after iphone became a runaway success in 2012.   a 40x-70x gain on just 20k invested in 2001 would boost many people into financial independence by 2011-2012, and aapl stock is up 7x since then.",2,,Magikarp_to_Gyarados,0

the red one for this gun has pretty much everything you need for warzone. 

setup like this: mx suppressor, 428mm barrel, 8mm kurz 60 rounds mag, lengthened, fully loaded, polymer grip, handstop &amp; 3.25 optic, 12 pvs stock, perfectionist

bar: this is i think the imperator blueprint. but you know its the right one if it has a gold 30 round .50 bmg mag &amp; golden mx suppressor. 

setup i use is as follows. 

mx suppressor, 30 xl barrel, 3.25 optic, pistol grip, handstop, stippled grip, lengthened, fully loaded, 30 round  .50 bmg &amp; hard scope 

these id say right now for guns i use have the most feature complete setups for warzone. obviously if you have the gun fully leveled then you can make them perfect guns for long range. 

both slap at all distances really. so hopefully that helps but i'd definitely recommend that you search the gun and look at the blueprint. 

if burst gun does take your fancy. the as44 blueprint called slipstream literally has all the right attachments from the get go. 

also to avoid waisting your money. if the stock is say different from the meta stock of that gun. changing the stock over will more than likely ruin the look of your gun, as most of the gun goes to default look.

1641190360,"the main value of blockchain is that it replaces employees with code, so it's more efficient and reliable (for tasks that can be coded). that's the most important reason why terra has successfully cut out traditional payment processors. 

obviously it's also a lot faster too. i can transfer money from one bank to another for free, but it won't be settled instantly, and i can't use something like zelle (which can be reversed) to process payments for business without relying on my bank's third party arbitration and fraud protection (which doesn't cover same day transfer reversals). instant settlement isn't free, and it requires middlemen. sometimes that is useful, but most of the time this is not something i'm interested in paying for. 

there's a market for cheap, instant finality. that's why money gram is partnering with steller. traditional payment processing might be finely tuned and optimized, but decentralized protocols can do things they will never be able to do.

&gt;funded by private venture capital.

terra's a good example of that too. completely funded by vc, but unlike traditional finance, where stock ownership is quite abstract and arbitrary (and dividends are optional), blockchains like terra write their profit sharing mechanism into the code. the investment incentive is more direct, and is based on code, not manipulated accounting or undefined expectations. i buy visa stock because i think other people will pay more for it later. i stake ust on anchor because i know that terra network fees get distributed to stakers. there's no middleman. the original terra vcs make their money the same way i do.

1641204323,"nice write up and yes i agree with most points.

you mentioned the mutant, but you can get the 7.62 akm/103 to 60 recoil rather cheap (meta stock/handguard are only ~20k) at which point they're devastating with bp or even ps. 

also yes bs is limited to 90 bullets per reset, but this is the same limitation that .45 acp has.. on top of that, you can craft 150 ignolnik at the same time rather cheap at which point you can get more meta 5.56x39 ammo than submachine ammo. especially with the rpm submachine guns have, they need more ammo than assault rifles.

submachine guns were prior to the vectors not even considered 'good' other than the mp7 which is still untouched. why would anyone wait/pay for expensive ap when they can run mp7s?

i do agree that ap/acp ap shouldn't be easy to come by and cheap, but crafting 150 ammo per 10 hours with a flea ban? cmon, that's not in line with the rest.

mp7 is a lot more dangerous than 9mm/.45 (especially) now vs sweaty players, yet no one is asking for a nerf here, why?

and as for m80 ammo. recoil doesn't matter much in a semi automatic like the sr-25. i'd rather shoot m80 in a shit/unmodded gun like the vepr hunter or m1a than pst gzh in an mpx in a cqb map like shoreline resort, simply because your pst gzh won't do much vs tier4, which everyone runs in cqb. cqb is where 9mm submachine guns should excel, yet they don't. i personally just find that odd balancing and that's why i find it odd people want all the 'decent' submachine gun ammo gone.",1,,AVA-1,0

apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion, tripling in valuation in under four years.

the milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of apple‚Äôs success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.

apple‚Äôs cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.

ple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.

the milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on apple stock and its ability to grow. apple was up over 2.5% during intraday trading on monday to a price per share over $182 after briefly hitting the $3 trillion mark.


at a market value of $3 trillion, apple tripled its valuation in under four years. and analysts see plenty of room to run.

apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. while the iphone is still the biggest sales driver, apple‚Äôs services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.

in december, for example, morgan stanley‚Äôs katy huberty raised the firm‚Äôs price target on apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren‚Äôt yet baked into the share price.

huberty also said she expects apple‚Äôs app store revenue to outperform morgan stanley‚Äôs forecasts for the quarter and for apple to ship 83 million units during the december quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.

apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest airpods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for apple‚Äôs wearables business during the quarter, analyst ming-chi kuo of tfi asset management limited said in a monday note.


wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote on sunday that the mark is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù but has more room to grow, especially since ives values apple‚Äôs services business at $1.5 trillion.

investors also turned to apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.

apple became the first publicly traded u.s. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on aug. 2, 2018. it hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on aug. 19, 2020.

apple‚Äôs peers aren‚Äôt far behind. microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and google‚Äôs market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.

1641242368,"1.) actually using crypto as currency is not really viable today. that is one reason people think we are early. that said, realistically actual payments will likely be done with stablecoins or cbdcs which aren't great investment vehicles.

2.) we all are. i tend to invest in coins that are at least in a low-mid cap range (not micro-cap). i don't think i own any coins outside the top 250 by marketcap and only a couple outside of the top 100 (in a portfolio that holds \~25-30 different coins).

3.) some will strike it rich if they get lucky, but agree, most will lose a lot putting it on shitcoins and hoping to get rich quick.

4.) some coins don't go up at all, ever. some are rug pulls, etc. also there are tons of new coins, this would get tiresome and be difficult to do. some hit the market with already over-inflated market caps (see icp) and drop like rocks. personally, i think it's better to find projects that have actual uses and invest in those (just like investing in the stock market).

5.) no guarantee that any will come back. btc is probably the most likely to still be around in 5-10 years simply because of the place it holds in the larger crypto ecosystem. sure, it might be worth less, but it's almost certainly not going away. eth is the next most stable, but even that is no guarantee. it's like investing in apple versus some penny stock. sure the penny stock could go up 100x and apple likely won't, but in 5 years, that apple stock is definitely going to be worth something.

6.) if you're doing about meme coins, those are in fact simply gambling. stick with your index funds.

7.) your other investments are not nearly as secure as you think. that said, this is a real risk that needs to be managed, but not something that should stop you from investing in the space. look into 2fa and high quality passwords. if you plan to hold 5 figures+, invest in a hardware wallet and educate yourself on how to use it safely and how to store the seed phrase.

8.) the wallet is more like a key. it is how you access the coins, not actually where they are stored. the wallet can be restored using your seed phrase. this is like the template for the key. if you lose this you could be in trouble, so you want to make a couple of backups and store them somewhere safe (a safe deposit box, a fireproof safe, etc.), maybe even split up into a couple of different locations if the dollar value contained would justify that.

9.) your financial advisor is a moron, you should get a new one.

10.) you need to make sure you leave a way for your heirs to access the coins. if they are on a hardware wallet, then you would need to make sure they have a way to get the seed phrase after your death, but you also would not want to leave the entire seed phrase with your lawyer as they could access and send the funds to a non-traceable wallet. my recommendation is that the lawyer has instructions on how to get the seed phrase which can be acted upon if you should die. for example, first 12 words in safe in my house with combination x, y, z, second 12 words in safe deposit box at xyz bank, key located in safe. this would make it impossible for the lawyer to get his/her hands on the seed phrase but someone executing your will would be able to.",3,,Pokoire,0

time to start learning covered calls. missed out on a huge covered call i didn't see coming in $rig. could have made a nice chunk there i think. still haven't figured out how to setup a limit sell(?) on an option. it might just be the investopedia.com platform.

also found out that i can use fidelity's atp software which is kinda neat. only works on one monitor though. it'd be killer if i could put the different windows on different screens. i am a software engineer so i am used to having running 5 monitors. might need to invest in a really large format monitor. fidelity will only allow me to buy options on stocks i own - i think this is what a covered call means. i should have chosen my stocks better.

1641276239,"heh. reddit won't like it. well definitely not denver sub. the finance and business subs wouldn't mind it, balance sheet is the balance sheet. nobody escapes it. 

we managed to save one of the local small biz joints out here on the prairie once folks knew they were struggling to keep the lights on via massive community take out orders and a near constant stream of them, but a place like bk couldn't be saved that way. i'm surprised they made it this long after lockdowns. 

reddit also subscribes to the concept that all owners of things are bad. lots of owners are just constantly broke. especially in the restaraunt biz. there's no margin. one bad month you're usually in the debt spiral and never get out of it. maybe two if you're lucky. 

i know a couple of guys who own a very popular bar near coors field. they bought a complete shithole and slept in the basement while they did all the renovations themselves. we all thought they were insane. they probably still are but booze and baseball tend to go together so it worked out. as far as i know they pay decently for what it is, but i'm sure there's no corporate 401k plan. ha. 

the in crowd needs their $3 pbrs ya know. ha. or whatever the drink of the day is in the city. not going to be funding many retirement plans with company matches selling those from a stock yard trough filled with ice. 

a couple other friends better at business own a couple restaraunts down there most here would know the names of. successful as restaraunts go they offered friends the ability to invest in the late 90s. took ten years before any of the investors saw a dime. i couldn't invest back then but i hear the big payoff is roughly $1000 a year to 10 initial investors. the tax form is always late and more of a pain in the ass than anything. but we were asked to invest and investing because we knew them, not because we even thought they'd survive. no bank would have ever floated them the loan. 

ten years to start making your money back on an investment isn't really an investment. but more fun seeing them make it than anything. and more interesting than sitting on apple stock, but definitely not nearly as lucrative. 

all the areas of downtown that these establishments are in now have cutesy names. back then we mostly just wondered why they were going to try to run a business in a shithole in a building that was literally falling apart. 

i doubt any of them would want to repeat the experience of filling multiple full sized dumpsters with crap by hand now. or sleep in the basement just to keep people from breaking in and trashing the place thinking it was still abandoned.",-5,,denverpilot,0

1641296131,"[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50846539/shift-in-bash-but-on-arrays-instead-of-arguments) is a so answer that has a couple of ways to do it. the first suggestion is to use array slicing to reset the array without its first element each time.  the second is to convert the array into the positional parameters using `set` and then using `shift` to advance to the next one.

for what you're describing though, do you actually need to modify the array, couldn't you just loop over it and do the next element instead of actually modifying the array and taking the first each time?

    vals=( 'first' 'second' 'third' )
    for v in ""${vals[@]}""; do

[aabb got me involved in crypto and from there i turned very bearish on aabb. it is a ethereum token was not a great decision as it is going into a very crowded ecosystem in an environment where gas fees are going to kill anyone not moving large quantities. so this right here is going to trash adoption by masses and undermine their stated intent. things might change after the next major ethereum update, that is suppose to address gas prices,  but that could be next week or two years.   on top of that they sold off their one operating mine and have no revenue other than tokens/exchanges for the past half year. if you look at their books it isn't a pretty picture and could be a long time before they have operating revenue. the icing on top is their other business of of buying and importing metals to asia has also reported no revenue since the mine sale.   i sold out in nov, hold my restricted shares and likely will not reenter until i see changes. their imminent launch notice in early october for a dec 28th launch could very likely lead to a sec investigation.  if you look you will see i was one of the first to present aabb here too.](/r/pennystocks/comments/rtkdv3/0001_bottom_feeder_lotto_one_year_results_link_in/hqvsses/)

[i don‚Äôt like musk, and i‚Äôve never owned a share of tesla. but the best argument i‚Äôve heard for teslas valuation came from musk himself. he said in an interview, ‚Äúwarren buffett may be a good investor, i don‚Äôt know, but i don‚Äôt know why anyone would give him $1 to invest in soda companies which are slowly killing people. i want to try and advance humanity, and i think that‚Äôs worth more to a lot of people than giving coca-cola another dollar.‚Äù - now i would argue that so far musk hasn‚Äôt really ‚Äúdone‚Äù anything to advance humanity. evs existed before him, as did rockets, but things are moving quicker because of him, and i could see how it‚Äôs possible in 10 years we are better off as a society with tesla around and money to spend on new ideas than not. so i‚Äôm actually ok with tesla trading at a ridiculous multiple, it allows them to do more interesting things. it‚Äôs a lot better than giving that multiple to coca-cola or jp morgan, or berkshire that‚Äôs for sure. and i think cause of that, i‚Äôll just go buy a little tesla and join the party and hope they invent something really cool one day that changes our lives a lot for the better.](/r/stockmarket/comments/rvdowq/tesla_added_140_billion_in_mkt_cap_on_2_billion/hr7alpf/)

[gopro is downright spectacular compared to the potential losses from options. say your account is 20k, use the 2% rule of thumb (don't risk more than 2% in any one trade), and you spend $400 on an options contract. tsla gains posts make it look like you can hit 20x if you pick the right one, but it's _incredibly_ nerve-wracking to watch it drop to $50, and even more tempting to say ""oh, i'll just average down/roll it, it has to go up"". you need an explicitly acknowledged plan, even if the plan is ""ride with it until it expires worthless"".  most places (/r/daytrading wiki) suggest paper trading, or literally write off $1000 to put into a ""test"" account; you're incredibly likely to lose it all if your current fomo guides your trades, and you need to get less excited about it. seriously. doubling down, fomo, fd's all have their place, but it's _after_ you understand some basics + risk management for yourself.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rve1bl/aapl_yolo/hr5who4/)

[tesla is a company which applies all they do (from batteries to software) to the production of actual cars (for the automotive division). therefore, if they sell a lot of cars they are selling a lot of the vertical integration they have. this vertical integration is one of the reasons why the margins are so high.   plus, tesla has big economies of scale. this means that beating the estimate causes a more than proportional increase in the profits.   308k is a lot different from 267k. it shows a company able to apply its extremely advanced know-how to the scaling of production, in a way that exceeds expectation on most quarters and that nobody else has been able, for now, to replicate on evs (cue: the production distance between vw and tsla is, actually, increasing).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rueag9/tesla_bears_about_to_move_from_the_endangered_to/hr23l9u/)

1641317040,"i completely understand your perspective, but i think i see the value in dave's advice. i'm looking into purchasing my first home now, after these homes have gone from 250-&gt;450. i think dave's advice at it's core is to reduce risk. you have zero risk of not being able to make payments if you don't have any. a house is like all investments, you need to decide how much risk you are comfortable with. and purchasing a house poses a unique risk to most buyers, it is often the single most expensive item you own, and on its own in terms of percent of net worth. it also carries a unique penalty of if your financial portfolio fails significantly enough, you can be out of a place to live. dave is setup to help you not encounter any noticable negative consequences to a downturn in your personal financial world, or to a downturn in the global/national market.

like all investments, past performance is not indicative of future gains/losses. i wish i bought apple stock 20 years ago, or tesla stock 5 years ago. i'm glad i didn't buy sears stock 15 years ago. in the same vein, i wish i owned multiple properties 5 years ago and was able to realize the gains in the market, but i'm glad i didn't have mortgage(s) and then get laid of in 2006. 

it's completely appropriate to make your own decision and determine what level of risk you are comfortable with, dave goes to the extreme to help get people realizing that even a mortgage has a risk. it's up to you to determine your risk profile, you chose to make a decision to listen. 

i won't speak to the practices by which he makes money, as i'm not familiar, but it's not his fault, he did not force you to listen. and on the terms of whether to buy/wait unfortunately my crystal ball still doesn't work.",2,,randobandoacc,0
1641317148,"alright people, there's 3 ways this works based on the type of account inherited

roth - you have to have it out in 10 years, you owe no income tax on any of it, you can change investments within the account with no tax effect

traditional - you have to have it out in 10 years, every dollar you take out is subject to income tax. any changes you make within the investment portfolio will not trigger taxable capital gains

non qualified account - as in not a retirement account, just a plain brokerage account. gets a step up in cost basis based on the date of grantor's death. any interest, dividends, or capital gains realized within the account are taxed at their different appropriate rates whether you take distributions from the account or reinvest the proceeds. no 10 year rule

the cost basis of the securities in a qualified retirement account literally means nothing, you pay taxes on distributions, not what actually goes on within the account. you could have a million dollars worth of apple stock that you paid 50k for in the 90s in a retirement account. if you sell 10k of it and take it out of the account you pay 10k of income tax, that's it. if you wanted to sell 500k of that stock and use the proceeds to buy 500k of google or whatever you could do so without paying any capital gains",1,,jm7489,0

1641344660,"huh?

if i buy a house and live in it and then sell it for more money than i bought it for 10 years later, the value i obtained from buying the house is more than just the profit from the sale. i also gained because i had a house to live in. so even if the price only keeps up with inflation it might be worth it for me to buy and live in the house.

if i buy apple stock, and apple uses the money it made from selling the stock to build products that people use, the value from my having put money into apple isn't simply from any profits i made from owning it. additionally, if apple pays dividends, that money is coming from apple being profitable - i.e. having created something of value. 

if i buy an empty and inaccessible plot of land in the middle of siberia and i sell it to someone else five years later who also can't use it, the value to me is only the profit. if the asset cannot possibly have any use for any one other than happening to sell it for a higher price than originally purchased for, then the greater fools issue applies.

i'm sorry but there is basically nothing you can say to me to convince me otherwise tbh

there is a reason no country uses the gold standard anymore, it's completely inflexible in a crisis and rampant deflation is just as bad for an economy as rampant deflation, both have horrifying consequences, different consequences, but equally horrifying.

and frankly, those stablecoins will likely be government issued, there is absolutely no way a decentralized currency will ever supplant fiat, again, because it's inflexible in a crisis, a government needs to be able to get money into people's and businesses hands when things go south, you dont have enough control over a decentralized system for that to work....because it's decentralized...no one controls it

1641350062,"if it were just the stock trading part, then absolutely! this is a big part of why the dotcom bubble crash happened - a lot of those companies were barely more than a fa√ßade to sell stocks that represented no actual revenue or assets. 

the **big** difference between stocks and crypto is that stocks are (supposed) to represent ownership of a company's assets and revenue. this makes them a good buy even and especially if they are cheap. this even has a name, it's called value investing - it's trying to pay low prices for a company's future earnings. the practical difference that makes a profitable company not-a-ponzi is that new money does not come **only** from new investors since the company can reward shareholders directly, either through dividends, share buybacks (which are functionally equivalent), mergers, acquisitions and rarely liquidations (assuming it has a positive nav). a company's net profits and assets are the shareholders' to keep, at least in theory.

i'll make it very clear to you with a very simple example:

imagine you had bitcoin on one hand and apple stock on the other. then, by some divine event, all holders of apple stock and bitcoin were forced to sell their stock or bitcoin, but nobody else **except you or the company itself** could buy the asset, now and in perpetuity. assume you had a bunch of money to work with from the start, but not infinite. enough to buy nearly all of the bitcoin and nearly all of apple stock for effectively nothing (since nobody else is buying).

now, does it make sense to buy the bitcoin? not really, does it, even if you could pay like a cent per bitcoin? it has no other greater fool to sell it to and thus loses its main appeal. you could use it as a currency i guess, which was the original point?

however, does it make sense to buy apple stock for effectively nothing? let's say a cent too, even though there's about 760 times the number of apple shares (16 billion) compared to bitcoins (21 million), making the stock much more expensive if you compare market cap. it does, of course,  make sense. the nav per share (or book value per share) of apple is currently around $3.74. this means that, since you bought the stock for $0.01, you got $3.73 in profit pretty much on the house. it would be like me selling you real estate valued at $3.73 million for $10.000. you'd have to be a fucking moron not to take me up on my offer. this is not considering the sale of a single solitary product, just what is on the books. since you now own apple, it's all yours to do whatever the fuck you want with it. liquidate it, change it into an actual apple company, exhume steve jobs' corpse (not legal advice), fire the ceo and replace it with a chicken, just keep it running, expand operations, reduce operations, whatever. it's your company now. 

see the difference? stocks represent ownership over a company's assets and revenue (diluted though it may be). owning the private keys to a wallet full of bitcoin means you can... send it to another wallet. that's it. nothing else to it.",3,,Stenbuck,0

high brush had grown threw out the plantation. this area was known to be a vc haven and
they were there in large numbers. shortly before being deployed to the plantation, our battalion
cmdr. col. hank ""gunfighter' emerson, had ordered, out of his own pocket, hatchets from
the united stated. when they arrived at our battalion, col. emerson let us know that we were
all going to have to pay him $3.00 for a hatchet and that we had no choice in the matter. he
also informed us that the first trooper's squad to kill a vc with a hatchet would be rewarded
with a case of liquor. we were now to be known as the ""hatchet men"" and our patrols would
be known as ""hatchet teams"" and our company sign was changed to show two crossed hatchets. we didn't want the hatchets, as we had no use for them and we had enough to carry on our backs without another three pounds, but we had no choice in the matter. when the hatchets arrived, and were passed out to us, the handles were white, and we were instructed to paint them black, so they would not stand out in the bush. i was in charge of the detail for my platoon to paint the handles black and have supplied a photo showing them drying after being painted. with our new hatchets, we were deployed to the michelin rubber plantation. our three company platoons were traveling in file on a narrow plantation road, 3rd platoon on point, 1st platoon following and 2nd platoon last. suddenly gunfire erupted from in front of us, 3rd platoon. on point, had been ambushed. word was quickly passed to us, 1st platoon to go forward and engage the enemy and assist 3rd platoon which we did. the gunfight lasted about an hour with the vc withdrawing, leaving behind some dead and wounded. we were dispersed in the brush along the road side and one of the 3rd platoon troopers, who i shall not name, came across a wounded vc and with the assistance of some others managed to hold him down and he then proceeded to whack his head off with his new hatchet. the trooper proceeded to the road, very proud of his trophy and held it above his head as proof that he had killed the first vc with a hatchet and that his squad would claim the case of liquor that ""gunfighter"" emerson had promised. a reporter from life magazine was attached to us at the time and he took a picture of the trooper displaying the head, i believe that his name was malcolm brown. shortly thereafter the picture appeared on the cover of the dec. 65 issue of life magazine in the u.s. word very quickly came down to get rid of the hatchets and anyone caught with one would be brought up on charges of ""brutality‚Äù needless to say, ""gunfighter"" did not refund us our three dollars each for the hatchets that he had forced us to buy from him. the trooper that had taken the head was later kia. our co. commander was cpt. thomas taylor, son of gen. maxwell taylor.

because they kept waiting for it to stumble. apple's history has been one of growth and then a giant stumble. around 2008-2010/11 few investors and analysts thought smartphones were going to become a fusion of pda and laptop like they have so apple's push for that sort of a unified device wasn't convincing market analysts and bigger investors.

hard to say, but you're confusing capital gains on investments with payments, which is very misleading.   if you're going to treat btc like an investment, you need to think of it more like a stock or a bond.

what if you could pay for airbnb in stock shares?  e.g. transfer one share of apple stock for a night in an apartment.  it's the same idea.

if you have lots of apple stock, this would be extremely convenient.  you wouldn't have to sell shares and wait for the sale to clear in order to give the money to airbnb, you could just give them the stock directly.

of course, pricing airbnb properties in terms of aapl shares would be kind of ridiculous, do you really want your apartment to get more expensive when the new iphone comes out??

when you buy stock on the stock market, the price (over time) reflects the performance of the company whose stock you bought. if you own apple stock and apple is performing week, the price of your stock will appreciate to reflect that performance 

this aspect of tokenmoics reflects the performance of the constellation ecosystem into the price of the dag coin. it adds credibility and backing to the price of the coin and will make it less volatile. as a dag holder, you should feel more secure than other crypto holders due to the backing the price of the dag coin has

side note, with the price of the coin reflecting the performance of the ecosystem, the partnerships constellation has will give the coin price a pretty high floor.

as companies join the ecosystem, there's more data being put through, the price will go up

as companies start to thrive and utilize the benefits of working with constellation, more data will be put through the ecosystem, the price will go up

for example, if you are investing in tracker funds that hold shares in companies, you are making money through the exploitation of the workers. that company‚Äôs growth is partially achieved by paying people as little as they can get away with (obviously not all, but a very sizeable chunk of companies)

if any of the companies in your portfolio manufacture anything with cobalt (used lithium ion batteries, for example), you are profiting from the exploitation of people working in horrendous conditions for next to no money. 

they‚Äôre saying people like to throw stones landlords and treat them like scum because they see having a roof as a basic human right, but they‚Äôre happy to invest in funds with apple stock in the portfolio. hating landlords is an odd line in the sand when they‚Äôll happily watch their investments grow on the back of human rights abuses and borderline slavery. they use children in cobalt mines ffs.

that‚Äôs just one example. there are many more companies achieving growth through some horrendous practices down the supply chain, yet people are happy to make money from that.

the difference? steve jobs sold his apple shares when he was ousted in favor of john sculley. bill gates kept his microsoft shares. \*that\* was the single biggest determiner of the net worth of each of them.",-1,,SeveralPrinciple5,0

1641441327,"&gt;as i understand things, up until here, i don't think there is anything that would trigger a wash sale. is my analysis correct?

correct.  writing calls is a bearish transaction, so can't wash your sale of aapl stock at a loss.

&gt;based on my understanding, even the above trade on 3/5 would not trigger a wash sale even though it was within 30 days of me selling 100 shares of aapl for a loss, specifically because it was an otm put and the irs would not consider this substantially similar to buying the stock outright. does that sound right?

no, that's not right.  section 1091(a) specifically provides that buying any call or writing any put will wash a sale of the underlying.

the $10 loss from your aapl sale will be tolled until you close the put contract, at which point the loss will be deducted from your profit.

the ambiguity comes when you close an option position at a loss, and whether a different option position can wash that loss.",8,,penguinise,0

this is part of what makes crypto so predatory in the developing world and partly why so many governments have stepped in. no social welfare state + young demographic pyramid + low financial literacy + limited investment opportunities + despair = disaster when crypto collapses.

tunisia pretty much had a revolution because a young man set himself on fire after being fined by the police for selling fruit without a permit, that he could not afford. 

yesterday there was this article about the risk a crypto collapse posed to american democracy, in light of the fact that those marks are fantastic sheep for a fascist movement.

houses are not like stocks, in general, your house goes up in value due to the entire market in your area going up in value, and when you go to rebuy the value of whatever house you buy also went up in value at around the same %, think of this like buying apple stock at 100 a share, it shooting up to 150 a share and you sell but the only thing you can do with your profits is buy more apple stock, you are not making any profit on the sale, the only time you save money is buying early, every sale and repurchase of a house in the future is determined roughly by the market demands of the house the same market demands that impact your ability to sell and at what value. there are a ton of advantages to owning a house financially... but in the end the value of your house going up is not a value because all houses went up, and if you intend to buy a new house that house would have also gone up in price, even if the house is not any nicer it still went up about the same amount.",1,,Tech-ML,0

i am wondering now, if drew markham was brought on for a specific task.

it seemed that sumit and holt believe that we own all of our ip, and the statement about our 2017 customer: that ‚Äúthe agreement applies to a specific part in a specific product‚Äù and a new product would require a new deal. 

we are wondering. why the silence around ar. meanwhile, it seems our part is being used in ivas. so wouldn‚Äôt we get an announcement from the company? or would that not occur until msft gets paid for the hardware in 2022?

1641523006,"you talk about crypto being an investment and a currency in the same sentence, and then complain about the volatility that an investment naturally has and how it's destructive to its ability to be a currency - which is obvious, because the two don't mix. leverage isn't going anywhere, and even if it did it wouldn't change anything.

*you need* *to decide* what you want out of crypto. a currency or an investment. i know what i want, and i know what most people want as well. people may talk about adoption here, but at the end of the day, they do so because they think it will make them more money.

when you look at adoption (as a traditional payment method) it is predominately happening for two reasons. one, because of marketing opportunities seen by crypto-enthusiast (or opportunist) ran-businesses. two, because third world countries can finally use a liquid investment asset for the first time that is more stable then their own failing monetary systems. you want to know why people pull back on adoption after taking two steps towards it? it's because it's shallow adoption that exists to fulfill short-term goals. not long term ones, and that's not going to change, because no cryptocurrency exists today that functions well beyond that.

blockchain adoption comes in many other forms though where the price of a cryptocurrency is relatively meaningless to the functional problems the tech can help solve.  adoption in that form will likely continue to rise considering the positive trend that currently exists regardless of fluctuations in price.

so once again, the question that needs to be asked is ""why are you so concerned about short-term price movements that benefit long-term holders by providing better buying opportunities for a growing investment""?

unless the fundamentals change, then if apple stock dropped 90% tomorrow you don't go complaining about leverage traders getting liquidated and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't matter by thinking the prices of an investment has an effect on people that don't invest.

like i said, if you're that concerned with short-term price movements being ""stable or going up"" you're no different (and actually worse) than someone who wants to see those prices lower, because you clearly have a stake in a game you're looking to get out of. compare that to someone that is trying to accumulate as much as they can, because they realize that in 10 years - whatever the hell the price did won't matter anymore. just like the what prices did 10 years ago don't matter today even when they were more volatile (without leverage).",1,,Nomadux,0

* the appetite for investment products perceived to be ""risky"" is really low in europe, much lower than in the us. the european investment market is dominated by pension funds and/or income funds which prioritise dividends.
* ucits regulations are a hurdle for small thematic etfs like the roundhill ball metaverse etf. in fact $meta would probably not have met the so-called ""5/10/40"" diversification rule at fund inception, in fact it barely meets it now.
* an index-tracking ucits fund needs to use an index which is recognised by it's regulator. $meta is using the ""ball metaverse index"", which violates the ucits rule that the index used for an index-tracking ucits fund must be independently managed from the management of the ucits fund.",7,,JoeK76,0

it's still quite ok for the microsoft stock, something like ibm trades at frankfurt with daily volumes of 500-700 shares, that's like 100k euro per day (nyse has over 1m daily turnover).

1641584325,"as an apple employee, i'm not offended by this.  sure, i make much, much less than tim, but he is directly involved in creating huge amounts of wealth to share holders, some of whom presumably make much more than tim from apple stock (i'm looking at you warren buffett).  i do my small little part, but i'm happy with where i'm at financially.  if i wasn't, i'd move on to another company or try starting my own business.  having said that, while the amounts for tim are obscene, he leads a company that drives innovation.  the pay is high because the expectations are high.  would we have airpods and apple watch with someone less incentivized to succeed?  i don't know, but there's a chance that this wouldn't be the case.  

when we ask ourselves whether tim (or any successful ceo, not elizabeth holmes) is worth this money, i think we need to ask ourselves if anyone else with exorbitant paychecks is worth their pay, such as professional athletes.  the really good ones put butts in seats and get people to tune into their games and buy team merchandise.  when they drive added revenue for their teams, it makes sense for them to get a larger piece of the pie.  if they didn't, the owners would take home this money, it's not like it just disappears or stays in the consumers pocket.  same for tim, if he was paid less for his successes at apple, that money would go to the remaining shareholders.  i don't disagree that the influence this kind of wealth can buy is concerning, but trying to boil this down to 'how much is too much' for any one person greatly oversimplifies the conversation.",22,,blinkertx,0

1641622561,"but it‚Äôs exactly that attitude that is the classic recipe for disaster.  the over confidence.  and the amount of money in these etfs is staggering.  if you look at any of the large cap companies, a significant chunk of the ownership is these funds.  which means the buying and selling of the etfs themselves will, if they are not already, start having an effect on the price of the things they supposedly only track. that also implies the etfs themselves can be subject to their own volatility (albeit they will drag all of their holdings with them so it will be masked). 

the trend is growing, too.  so to test an idea, you can frame it with an extreme scenario, as a thought experiment.  are you familiar with thinking?  ok, here we go.

imagine so much money goes into the major etfs like spy, vti, and qqq that the ownership of apple becomes 30% made up of these funds.  now imagine there is a sell off only of these etfs (i know this wouldn‚Äôt happen, but the scenario tests the theory).  would such a sell-off drop the price of the etfs (remember, no one is selling apple), and what about apple stock?  would it drop?  

apple is a good example.  it makes up about 6.5% of sp500 etfs like voo and spy.  these two etfs hold $700 billion of assets under management.  

qqq is 11.5% apple and manages $200 billion.

vt is 3% apple and is another $20 billion

vti is 5.5% apple and controls another $300 billion in assets.  

you get the idea.  and sure enough, when you look at apple ownership, it shows.  

you are basically saying that all this money and activity is somehow passive and not impactful on the underlying assets, which i find...literally impossible...and that would be the only way these etfs couldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúprice action‚Äù of their own, but they do.  see, it works both ways.  the etfs change when the underlying stocks change, yes, but the underlying stocks change when the etfs change, making the etfs subject to all market laws.",3,,DesertAlpine,0

1641636758,"firstly, let me emphasize a key point of tim cooks pay structure. $82.3m out of the $98.7m is stock based compensation (rsu's - restricted stock units). essentially, tim cook **only** gets this stock based compensation if he meets specific performance criteria defined by the apple board. (this essentially incentives him to make sure the company does well - and some of those metrics aren't an easy feat to achieve).

tim cook (as the ceo) has done a phenomenal job: he has bolstered the companies product line, increased revenue by \~x3 ever since he took over (and much more) and is constantly being placed in the top ceo rankings (*fyi, ceo r&amp;r: ceos are often responsible for expanding the company, driving profitability, and in the case of public companies, improving share prices*). 

now regarding creating value for shareholders, \~45% of apple's shareholder base are retail investors (your everyday individual). technically, the ceo answers to shareholders (ofc, there's the board etc. - but i'm just looking at it from a high-level) personally, i've made an amazing return on apple stock, (i earn way way below 'median wage' and by no means am i close to being rich), but watching the company grow and it's performance, i feel like he's done an amazing job.

1641650991,"stock trading and stock owning are two very different things. several republicans have been arrested for timed insider stock trading during pelosi's tenure. they come out of a meeting realizing covid is about to explode and they get on the phone to their broker and say se;; carnival cruise buy moderna.   that is illegal with or without pelosi and pelosi is not defending that at all.   btw trump pardoned two of them.  pelosi at no time defended trading stocks, but owning a longterm portfolio or a diverse portfolio is another thing and should be permitted as it always has been.   

for instance, i have a large chunk of apple stock i bought 20 years ago. if i sell it it forces me to pay capital gain taxes now not even i want in the future, i also cannot pass it along to my heirs.  so under the leftwing rules, i would be forced to liqudate 9 million dollars worth which is 80% profit so it puts me in the highest tax bracket and i lose 40% of my wealth right there, just to run for congress. and the apple stock would never influence my voting unless it waa a vote directly about apple, then i could recuse myself. so under leftwing logic it would cost me a million extra in taxes to run for congress, and the timing for th4 sale might be terrible too. see what i mean?

example #2, the dnc wants a rich man runs for congress because he is the only one who can beat a racist maga gop radical. he comes from a family that owns a major company. this company may or not not gain from his votes. he has legacy shares, the kind passed down from generation to generation. hate the rich if you like but oftentimes rich people are recruited to run for office because they can finance themselves usually against an equally rich republican.  in a perfect world maybe rich people wouldn't be able to run unless they had all their money in cash, but that is not realistic. not witj citizens united and the current campaign financing rules and pelosi does not have the votes to change that.  not yet.  so you can't tell that man he must liquidate his legacy assets to run for office. pelosi herself comes from a rich family, and when has she ever voted corruptly to help her family assets? never.

this leftwing anger falsely aimed at pelosi really is about trump and manchin plus it goes to aoc's ""tax the rich"" message, or in this case ""get the rich out of politics"".. trump never divested anything and profiteered 24/7.  manchin's coal and oil investments may have influenced his opposition to some green energy items though he claims instead that he just didn't see the need to subsidize green energy more as there was already incentive. so there you are right, manchin should waive or rec use himself from matters like that if and only if they specifically affect a major investment of his.  but to require manchin to divest of all holdings or even put them in a blind trust is asking too much. we don't eve have those rules for potus or for any other government position.

point #4, even if you forced congressmen to liquidate investments they still have campaign donors, pacs, allies, etc so they could work around this rule. manchin for instance cold simply take donations from the came interests whose stock he was forced to sell. so it amounts to the same thing. manchin might be a little corrupt, but as a general rule the gop tends to be much more corrupt that dems, and the few dems who have been caught being corrupt seem to be urban blacks.  that is, in modern times.  so i doubt the black caucus would support this even if they themselves were not affected.",0,,Immediate-Assist-598,0

you are getting two valuable assets for exchanging your dollars. 

so lets say after eth 2.0. 

1.what will be the worth of a 3090?

2. what will be the value of your mined currency?

calculate 1+2 and you have your answer.

so lets calculate 1 and 2.shall we?

1. lets say the 3090 is worth 50% of what your paying now. i.e 50% of 2860$ = 1430$.
2. 1x3090 gives you about 0.00415520 btc after electricity(0.1$/kwh) in one month. let assume that we have just 6 months , so that's 6x0.00415520 btc = 0.0249312 btc. 

now lets assume that 1 btc would come to around 50k usd. so your mined currency would be worth approx. around 1200$. 

so 1 + 2 = 1430$ + 1200$ = 2630$

1641728396,"[the answer is yes, they can go lower.  part of the problem is the lack of institutional capital.  even the biggest of big boys are borrowing around \~8-10%.  and that's probably around the roic a retailer would expect/want, so almost everyone dilutes shares for capital.  low share prices drive valuations lower. eg, if curaleaf could build a dispensary for 10,000 shares in feb last year, now it costs 22,000.  another is tax law of illicit businesses, they can claim virtually 0 deductions (as if they have 0 expenses), so \~20% of revenue for msos goes to the federal government.  some ideas like green thumb and trulieve seem interesting to me.  they both have positive gaap margins, and positive ocf.  any mso whose operations would be accretive to shareholder value while i wait for the legalization pop would be a top tier idea.    trulieve is especially cheap, given its growth rate and gaap earnings.  though every time i look through an ir presentation from an mso they say ""opening 7 trillion stores in florida over the next 3 months"", so maybe the market expects margin compression with the absurd number of dispensaries pouring into florida.  idk.  imo, if you want to trade these, wait until you see a catalyst on the horizon.](/r/stocks/comments/rz1pvf/can_marijuana_stocks_go_lower/hrsvk29/)

ask yourself this op before you buy. realize there are a million new projects being developed as we speak on second and third generation blockchains.

i am bullish on the sector as a whole but would never pick a single coin out of thousands to be the one that ends up exploding, it's a complete gamble like buying only 1 stock.

if you want to play pow in general, $nvda/$amd would be one way to do that. with pos being used for cardano, ethereum 2.0 and others this could be a risky bet, pos seems fundamentally better to me. also in the long run they could become uncorrelated due to mining on asics.

diversified crypto etfs are liable to deemed disposal in ireland so again, not an option.

buying the major exchanges like $coin stock or binance coin would eliminate a lot of crypto coin picking specific risk and trade it for competitive brand risk. chances are though that a cool new platform will arrive and wipe out the old exchanges.

1641752895,"there are 3 kinds of taxes you may have to pay on a taxable account:

1. taxes on dividends
2. taxes on capital gains *distributions*
3. taxes on capital gains

the first two you need to pay yearly, as incurred.

the third you pay after the sale of a security.

my understanding for taxes is that the rules for how much you need to withhold or pay...  or *when* you withhold or pay is the same, regardless of income source.  you must be payed up by january 15th per irs *safe harbor* rules.  so if you are incurring enough in taxable gains to not meet the safe harbor rules, then you'll need make quarterly payments to the irs.

capital gain distributions can also come from an individual stock if it pays more in dividends than the company has income, and you have no basis in the stock. while they look identical to dividends and do actually represent cash received, they're reported as capital gain distributions. usually only happens with reits, as they often report very little income due to depreciation, but have huge amounts of cash on hand to distribute to shareholders.",1,,zffch,0

when you buy a stock, you‚Äôre signaling that you believe the stock is undervalued. when you buy apple stock it should be because you believe that the price of apple stock should be higher. your justification will be tied almost certainly to the outlook of its performance as a company. if apple looks like it will perform poorly, then you would assume the stock is overpriced and not buy or even sell what you have. 

a company with strong financials and a sustainable revenue may never explode, but it will also likely not implode either meaning that it will exist for a while and your stock will not go to zero.

i don't mind personal questions. i'm impossible to offend and i've never got why people keep secrets. 

my education is:

- bs economics - nyu
- bs finance - nyu
- ms financial economics - columbia business school (sounds redundant but it isn't) 

the reason why i went with financial economics instead of an mba which is much more common for my line of work is my fianc√©e was getting her mba at the same time. she is a very intense person and i figured it was better for my own sanity to go with my second choice. i had the blessing of the fund that it would be equally as good to them so i wasn't worried. now i am looking into a phd in economics. my boss has one and highly recommends it for personal growth. my fianc√©e will also have her phd in nutritional science in 2 years and i can't let her beat me. she's a big reason i am as motivated as i am. only person i really care about impressing. 

i got a internship at a hedge fund my senior year of undergrad then was offered a full time position as a analyst for that fund. did that for 3 years when i finished my ms degree and was offered the promotion to associate.

big thing that helped me is i have an incredible memory and i am above average at math compared to other ivy league grads coming out of columbia, harvard, etc. 

one big test the hedge fund does is they give you $100k as an intern and $1m as an analyst your first year. you get 100% free reign over it. they don't care if you use it to buy apple stock or bathtub drain futures. they use your performance as a metric for getting hired/promotions. when i went for my interview to be promoted my $1m had averaged 215% apr. it was $31m. that pretty much guaranteed the promotion that i was already favored to getting. i also cheated in a way. i took the money to another brokerage and used it to borrow more money on margin. that's now officially against the rules because of me. the fund manager loved that. *""you play dirty, i like that""* was all he said during that part of the interview. 

part of my compensation is i get 0.5% of that free money with some caveats regarding minimum performance. which adds a quarter million a year to my income. .

hedge funds are incredibly big into culture fit. you can be very good at your job but if you don't fit in socially you'll never get hired. i was an absolute perfect culture fit for 99% of it. only issue i had was i came from money, my boss grew up in poverty and typically refused to hire trust fund kids, you could get a job at the fund just not working under him which was where the real career opportunities laid. he was outvoted luckily and i joined his team.",1,,WurthWhile,0

sorry about poorly worded edit on my part. when i started the project it was 10k in capital. at some point i took some of the cash and put it into what my broker calls a savings account. trying to double dip on the csp premiums and the shit ""interest rate"" on offer. 

i've also got a habit of taking 25-30% of money from premiums  and buying $msft,  aapl, jpm, dis, axp. i've seen people on here note that i should roll it all into more wheels. but i just want something to show for it all in case these wheels all go tits up.

i don‚Äôt like her but i think the best argument that can be made against her is not insider trading but maybe undue influence. she will always work to create a positive environment for tech companies from her area and prevent legislation that they would find burdensome.  
  
the issue with that being linked to insider trading is that it is public knowledge. she is elected to do precisely that. those are her constituents and it is similar to representatives fighting against base closers in their districts.  
  
it is also why she is speaker of the house. she is great at fundraising for the dnc because tech companies want their interests protected.

1641879060,"that's a really great point you make.  well, first, it's important to understand that not all crypto is the same.  in fact, many of them are very different because it's basically programmable money, so any kind of protocol can be invented to dictate its governance structure.  bitcoin happens to be one with a finite supply, which is good because it increases its value.

which, brings me to my second point and that is the fact that unlike stock crypto can be fractionalized.  by that i mean instead of buying one bitcoin that's worth 40k or 100k, you're able to buy .0003% of one bitcoin or less if you want to.  this makes the barrier to entry virtually non-existent no matter how much the price of the coin increases.  yes, there's a technological barrier to entry, but all of that is being worked out as we speak, and eventually, it'll be as seamless as regular banking.

that's what makes all of this so great because with stocks, not only do you have to put a substantial amount in it to make any real return in your life, but you have to buy each stock, so if i wanted to buy apple stock, i'd have to pay $172 per share and given the fact that it took over 30 years just to get to that price that means if i just bought one stock or two, my return would be very small.

but with crypto, you can buy any fractional amount of it and because it pairs so beautifully with network effects, if you find an early coin that's tied to the value of a great project you can buy 20 or 100 thousand or more tokens on a cashier's salary and within a year or two you could see some insanely crazy gains, which you can then either cash out into a stable coin and get 6 percent interest or more or convert it to bitcoin and put that into a crypto bank to get 6 percent apy on it.  that's insane, to me.

yes, the market is really new and there's a lot of scams and hacks surrounding it and some of the coins are just downright ponzi schemes.  so i'm not saying it's some miracle thing right now that everyone should just blindly walk into.  obviously, do your homework and never put in more than you're willing to lose.  but regardless, there's real value in this technology right now and in the future, particularly with daos as most ipo's will become a thing of the past and instead of having a few big stakeholders in companies you'll have regular users of the company being the stakeholders and making decisions for their own products, services, and online communities using tokens that are tied to the value of the company.

so as the value of the company rises, so too, do the coins that the users own, which incentivizes voting to make better decisions as everyone will lose out if they make a shitty decision.  but even daos have a lot of issues and they're not miracles just yet.  but still.  it's really exciting stuff that i think more people should be paying attention to.  don't let media fool you otherwise.",1,,Telkk,0
1641879917,"i've been speculating about this a bit ever since the tombstone tweet. it was a very notpr0n-ish tweet, and while going through the basic notpr0n moves, i noticed that **ryancohen dot com** redirects to **apple dot com** \- has done so for a long while now, though.

it also made sense to me then, and it would still make sense to me now. mainly because apple has great mobile platforms that kickstarted mobile gaming, but they lack any *real* gaming nowadays. their arcade is a big cashgrab 'meh' in my opinion. if they provide the hardware and gamestop the games, that would be a killer combo.

another thing i've wondered about is the fact gamestop sells certified, refurbished iphones. there are a lot of outlets out there that sell refurbished iphones, but one of the big hurdles of those has always been that apple is quite, quite anti-right-to-repair, meaning they don't sell their components, including the batteries, outside their own repair service. based on my current understanding, most refurbished iphones come with 3rd party unlicensed batteries due to this, which can make certain units dubious. i found it strange when gamestop started offering refurb iphones... but if they had a back door partnership to the component source... that would be another thing entirely.

i could very well see right-to-repair kicking off (and rightly so) everywhere in the world in the near future, and apple partnering up with the likes of gamestop to do their repairs for them. this could be a soft launch of sorts.

anyway, apple stock is on my blue chip shortlist for post-moass investment. i use their products and see the merits of the ecosystem, but hate their slave-driving and anti-right-to-repair practices. i'll be that vocal shareholder who tells them to fuck profits and do the right thing. üëä",79,,ChemicalFist,0

[agreed. even if this is 2018 all over again where the market reacted to aggressive interest rate hikes there will be opportunities for discount buying. in 2018 it took 4 months for nsdaq to bottom from it‚Äôs high at the end of august. from it‚Äôs bottom at the end of december it reach a new ath 4 months later in april 2019. buying on every down week would have paid off nicely. worst case scenarios are a dot com bubble or 2008 situation. in both events the bottom was reached after 31 months and 18 months respectively. even in 1973 a bottom was reached in 10 months. buying at the top of 2000 and holding unfortunately would have left you with a grueling 15 year wait to get your money back. the take aways is i have no idea how to interpret any of this in a way that‚Äôs useful. at least msft and aapl pay dividends.](/r/stockmarket/comments/ryjfhz/tech_stocks_continue_to_go_down_as_energy/hrt6wkq/)

[i do think nvda is at a premium.  but you can't always value a company using fundamentals and usual value models.  cars will use more and more chips. from 100 to 1,000 to maybe even 10,000+.  data centers will have to keep growing. look at all the streaming companies dis, hbo, nflx, etc. more content needs to be stored and streamed.  internet and apps will need data centers.  emerging markets will start needing phones and modern infrastructure.  asian nations are building smart cities.   another good example is printer ink, they didn't have chips so they need a work around. recent article lately.  hard to model that kind of demand.  also demand aside. some companies trade at a premium for their history of growth and stability. like msft, aapl, o, etc.](/r/stocks/comments/s0msw0/nvidias_fair_valuation/hs2qehw/)

but it is a system with value that grows  iphones get better, lithium mines openened.  these things power our lives.


crypto, not so much it is completely virtual , it takes and does not give.

and as the spate of ape losses shows suddenly the advantages of centralisation pop up, law enforcement , rules , accountability.  

i wouldn't trust a system ran and mined from third world dictatorships to be in your best interest.

have fun make some cash, but in the end if everybody went ahead and digged into it then your crypto would be meaningless. cuz who'd buy at inflated prices.?

in november, lockheed martin won a $10.9b contract to modernize the air force's f-22s. house republican kevin hern, who sits on the house committee on the budget, bought lockheed martin stocks back in august. he bought another round, this time up to $100k, in $lmt just 2 weeks before this news.

house democrat kathy manning, who sits on the house committee on foreign affairs, bought up to $30k in $lmt stocks on october 22. just 2 weeks before the news!

house democrat zoe lofgren bought up to $15k in $lcid on october 13. now up 71%. in the past, rep. lofgren has co-sponsored legislative proposals for ev tax credits.

the us army first announced a $22b augmented reality deal with microsoft on march 31, 2021 and reiterated its commitment to this partnership in october. speaker nancy pelosi disclosed exercising 150 calls on march 19, 2021 at a strike price of $130. she's up 160%.

senator cynthia lummis bought up to $100k in bitcoin on august 16. this was during when the senate was actively drafting crypto regulations.
also during that time, senator pat toomey drafted amendments to those crypto tax regulations while he held crypto‚Ä¶

in july, when senate republican tuberville finally released his late financial disclosures, we found that he had sold up to $15k in microsoft stocks in late june. this was 2 weeks before the $10b jedi contract between msft-dod was cancelled. tuberville sat on the senate armed services committee privy to defense contracts.
related: house republican pat fallon, who sits on the house subcommittee responsible for reviewing dod software contracts, sold up to $250,000 in $msft right before jedi contract cancellation.

in july, house republican blake moore disclosed buying up to $60k in $rtx while sitting on the house committee on armed services. specifically, he was making these trades while sitting on the subcommittee directly responsible for reviewing defense tech contracts.‚Äù

make sure you purchase at least 100 shares of each so you can write a contract.

1641968967,"&gt; i just know it's the more advanced version of `[ ... ]`!

take care, there are some subtle differences.

one of the biggest of these is that the right-hand side of the `==` and `!=` operators is treated as a _glob_, unless it is quoted.

that is:

    [[ foo ==  f*  ]]; echo $?    # 0
    [[ foo == 'f*' ]]; echo $?    # 1

similarly:

    v='f*'
    [[ foo ==  $v  ]]; echo $?    # 0
    [[ foo == ""$v"" ]]; echo $?    # 1

with `[ ... ]`, the unquoted versions would perform filename expansion, which would certainly not be what you wanted!

another thing is that to keep in mind is that the and and or operators are `&amp;&amp;` and `||`, not `-a` or `-o`. but technically speaking, support for `-a` and `-o` inside `[ ... ]` is optional anyway, so portable scripts cannot rely on them. (this is related to the ""4 or more arguments"" thing i mentioned in my previous comment.)

apart from these few things, everything you might do in `[ ... ]` should work the same in `[[ ... ]]`. moreover, there are some things you can do in `[[ ... ]]` that cannot be done at all with `[ ... ]` &amp;mdash; regular expression matching, for instance.

i also find it quite pleasing that `[[ ... ]]` mirrors bash's `(( ... ))` syntax for evaluating arithmetic expressions.

and finally, as i said before, since `[[ ... ]]` is shell syntax its syntax can be checked _during parsing_. this is not possible with the `[ ... ]` command, which can only fail during execution.

    $ [ = foo ]; echo survived
    bash: [: =: unary operator expected
    survived

    $ [[ == foo ]]; echo survived
    bash: conditional binary operator expected
    bash: syntax error near `foo'

in the second case, the execution of _the entire line_ was not performed since the syntax of the `[[ ... ]]` command was invalid. if you're writing bash scripts carefully, in such a way that the script's entire syntax is checked before any significant commands are executed, this can help prevent bugs.",5,,aioeu,0

1641972715,"the one you started this post off was a somewhat subtle example of word splitting.

word splitting applies to any expansion (something like `$some_var` or `$(some-command)` or `$((some expression))`) that is not double-quoted. when word splitting occurs the expansion is split upon whitespace (actually the characters in `ifs`, but let's assume you haven't changed that), and moreover if the expansion _only_ produces whitespace, or it is completely empty, no fields are produced at all.

so let's look at an example:

    $ v='a b c'
    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\n' $v
    &lt;a&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;c&gt;

here `$v` is not double-quoted. its expansion is `a b c`, and this undergoes word splitting, yielding _three separate arguments_. this is why `printf` produces three separate lines.

if `$v` is double-quoted, word splitting is suppressed:

    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\n' ""$v""
    &lt;a b c&gt;

as i said before, the command you opened this post off with had word splitting. when you ran:

    [ -n $hello ]

the `$hello` was not double-quoted, so its expansion ‚Äî just an empty string ‚Äî underwent word splitting. word splitting turns an empty string into _no arguments at all_. you were actually running:

    [ -n ]

where the `-n` isn't even treated as an operator at all.

now let's do something slightly different:

    $ v='/etc/host* /etc/*-release'
    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\n' $v
    &lt;/etc/host.conf&gt;
    &lt;/etc/hostname&gt;
    &lt;/etc/hosts&gt;
    &lt;/etc/fedora-release&gt;
    &lt;/etc/os-release&gt;
    &lt;/etc/redhat-release&gt;
    &lt;/etc/system-release&gt;

what's going on here is that `$v` is first expanded to `/etc/host* /etc/*-release`. this undergoes word splitting, so we then have two separate arguments, `/etc/host*` and `/etc/*-release`. both of these arguments contain glob characters, so filename expansion takes place on each of them. this produces seven separate arguments on my system, the filenames that happened to match those glob.

again, double-quoting `$v` can prevent filename expansion:

    $ printf '&lt;%s&gt;\n' ""$v""
    &lt;/etc/host* /etc/*-release&gt;

now, i have deliberately avoided mentioning anything about `test` or `[ ... ]` here because i wanted to make it clear how word splitting and filename expansion worked on their own. let's see how they can do weird things with `[ ... ]`.

    $ v='f != f'
    $ [ $v ]; echo $?
    1

so what's happening here? the expansion `$v` is not inside double-quotes, so it undergoes word splitting. this yields `[ f != f ]`. there's no glob characters here, so no filename expansion occurs, and so `[ f != f ]` is the command that's executed. it's not surprising this fails.

but if we were to change this to:

    $ [ ""$v"" ]; echo $?
    0

now word splitting is _not_ performed. we're back to the case when `[ ... ]` is given a single argument, and we know that just tests whether the argument is not empty. `f != f` is certainly not an empty string, so the command succeeds.

i've given an example in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/s1yxnn/empty_variables_pass_both_n_and_z_in_if_statement/hsbkqi4/) of how filename expansion inside `[ ... ]` can end up doing the wrong thing.

-----

**edit**: i realise now there's another aspect to all of this that hasn't been made clear. we've been using the term ""expansion"" rather loosely.

take a look at [this page](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/shell-expansions.html). this describes all the kinds of expansions performed by the shell on ordinary commands:

* brace expansion
* tilde expansion
* parameter and variable expansion
* command substitution
* arithmetic expansion
* word splitting
* filename expansion 

the order of these expansions is important. you'll note that word splitting is performed after most expansions... but it comes _before_ filename expansion! filename expansion actually takes place on the result of word splitting.

normal commands perform all of these expansions. `[ ... ]` is just an ordinary command, so it performs all of these expansions.

`[[ ... ]]` however only does _some_ of these expansions. it does not do brace expansion, nor does it do word splitting or filename expansion.",4,,aioeu,0

1642013337,"ok, this is very very rough so the purists there - please don‚Äôt come at me :) 

remember that probabilities are calculated on average for many scenarios. when you are dealing with probabilities we need to look at expected values. you seem to think that probability of .97 means that your expected value of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù is .97. it isn‚Äôt. it is zero. otherwise there would be arbitrage. 

so at that 300 strike, your probability of success is .97 with the expected payoff of .25. 

your probability of failure is .03 with unknown downside in those 3% of scenarios. 

however your ev (expected value) is zero. 

how much would you have to lose per share to have that expected value of zero?  let‚Äôs do some math:

ev = .97*.25 (premium) + .03*x(loss)= 0

x(loss) = - .97*.25/.03 = 8

so this tells you that on average the break even point on this situation is if nvda stock trades at $300+$8= $308. if it closes below $308 you win, if above - you lose. 

technically speaking you are underwater at anything over $300.25 but because we are dealing with that probability number now, it is all about averages. so on average your break even number is $308 in those ‚Äúbad‚Äù 3% of scenarios. 

nvda was trading at about $280 so it would have to move up by 308/280= 10% in order for you to have an expected value of less than zero - ie, a loss. the scary thing is that it can keep going up so your downside isn‚Äôt capped but your upside is that tiny .25.  you are essentially saying: ‚Äúi am ok getting .25 for a 3% risk that my stock will reach and surpass $308.‚Äù  and surpass by how much? nobody knows - hence these losses. 

remember that it doesn‚Äôt really matter what you odds are or what your probabilities are in that table - it‚Äôs all priced in and your expected value is always zero regardless if you are looking atm, itm, or otm. if that probability goes from 96% to 99%, you premium will go down to under .25 to normalize things again and make it so that ev=0.",2,,Dowdell2008,0

1642024789,"in 1922, the russian civil war is finally drawing to a close.  
  
after the assassination by bombing of vladimir lenin (along with several other nearby victims, including one v.n. lvov), commander-in-chief lavr kornilov was invited to assume control of the provisional government from aleksandr kerensky after the latter‚Äôs devastating collapse of support. kornilov was very clearly a right-wing figure, and his ascension to what was a dictatorship in all but name made the socialists increasingly uneasy.  
  
without lenin to throw them in one direction or the other, the soviet dithered back and forth on what action to take. in the meantime, kornilov restored general brusilov to command of the front, and rolled back many of the actions taken by order number one. mutinies and unrest were put down by a twofold action: the first was the death sentence for desertion, and brutal enforcement thereof by commissars chosen from the rear. the second was a promise of a small amount of land and a larger pension for those who continued to fight until the end, which kornilov claimed was in sight (this land would prove to come from the brutal ‚Äúrussification‚Äù of the western and southern territories).  
  
the soviet continued to debate, with leon trotsky becoming its unofficial leader, it still remained divided on the nature of the war, and many feared starting a civil war would destroy russia by giving the germans an opening. when the great war ended in 1918, the public‚Äôs view had radically changed on the socialists. their continuous delay in defending what they had fought for (order #1 and a socialist government), and the resounding success that remaining in the war had brought kornilov and the territory of russia, had left the socialist parties far weaker than they had been at the time of the february revolution.  
  
the socialists realized now would be their last chance to stop kornilov, while they still had any support at all, and they declared a full state of war, seizing control of moscow and laying siege to st. petersburg. several national groups also declared their independence at this time. in particular, the poles demanded total control of the prusso-polish commonwealth (much to the prussians‚Äô terror) and land from western russia, and the ukrainians and finns demanded their independence.  
  
while things were initially anyone‚Äôs game, volunteer forces from the allies began arriving in russia, and the socialists found themselves more short-handed than they had expected. by the third year of the war, only saratov, viborg, and a region surrounding moscow remained in socialist hands, and the strongest rebel groups were surprisingly the caucasians, rather than either the poles or the ukrainians.  
  
moscow would fall to a triumphant kornilov on september 4th, 1922. the collapse of the socialists brought an official end to the war, though caucasian and central asian fighting would continue into mid 1923. with kornilov‚Äôs national paternalists now secure in their position, they could go forward with the reforms russia so desperately needed, and hopefully begin to look outward after a decade of conflict.",1,,BigDulles,0

there are many things that you don't say in your post.  some of them include:

* what was on the fafsa that your parents filled out?  you should have seen what they filled out when you applied for financial aid and the income and assets of your parents is listed on this form.
* why didn't you attend the hypsm schools you were accepted into?  i don't know about all of them, but i believe that harvard and stanford have pretty phenomenal assistance loan/grant programs.
* your sister was accepted for school 6 years after you.  do you know that most people sell almost half of their stock grants immediately to pay for taxes and then keep the rest as a retirement nest egg?  do you realize that, for example, apple stock has risen from about $25/share in 2016 to about $175/share now.  if you parents had been saving for retirement and had accumulated $500,000 by 2016 then it would be reasonable for them to think that paying $250,000 for harvard is too much.  but that $500,000 investment in 2016 would now be worth about $3,500,000 if it was invested in apple stock.  this would put them in a very different financial position, and i am not even including the fact their their salaries have likely increased substantially in that time.  do you not understand that your parent's then-current financial situation played a large factor in their feeling they could not commit to paying $250,000 for you to go to school?
* parents want the best for their kids and almost always urge them to excel in school--so your parents did the same.  that they did not feel they could afford a super-high-priced private school is not a knock on them.  i have encouraged all of my kids to work hard in school and i have also recommended that they go to community college for their first two years to save money.  does this make me an ah?
* why do you think your parents are required to tell you the reasons behind their financial decisions from six years ago?
* you have provided no evidence that your parents are ""liars who pulled a giant bait and switch"" on you.

if i were your parent, i would, in 2022 when your parents feel comfortable selling their stock, give both you and your sister an equal amount of money--money that could be used to pay for school, invest in the stock market, buy a house, travel, or buy lottery tickets.

while your parents may not have properly handled the situation or how i would handle it, it does not sound like they were abusive or anything other than loving parents.  my guess is that you, even at your young age, have made mistakes before in your life.  are you able to forgive yourself for the mistakes you have made?

if you are never going to talk to them again as long as you live, then, whether or not yata, you are almost certainly hurting yourself.  i think it extremely likely you will change your mind and speak to them again.  if your goal is to hurt your parents, by lying to them about never speaking to them again, then give yourself a pat on the back.  you have almost certainly accomplished this goal.",1,,bay_area_born,0

people love to talk about gates, bezos, etc. having billions but they are only worth that on paper because of stocks in companies they started. they don't have 100 billion dollars in cash.  the majority of it is basically fictional wealth until they sell. the market could collapse, company could have issues, etc and their wealth drops sharply (could even disappear). market rebounds or stock skyrockets so does their wealth. it's just not a consistent way of taxing someone plus you are literally taking ownership stake away from them because they'll have to sell to pay the tax.   


there's loads of ways these people avoid taxes, we should close those loopholes. i want to tax them and tax them a lot but not based on their paper wealth as of 12/31 at 11:59:59pm",1,,monkywrnch,0

1642047612,"watches are not a viable investment.

two important things to consider about any investment are carrying costs and liquidity.

if i buy 100 shares of microsoft stock, that's it: i pay about $320 per share (today) and that's that: it sits there. every quarter, i get some money from a dividend. so, really, my carrying costs are negative -- i get paid to own the stock.

the value goes up and down daily. if i want to sell i can because there's a very market and it is liquid and accessible. converting those 100 shares back to cash will be done by the end of the day, and the cash available in my account within three days.

compare that to a watch. the carrying costs are high because the watch must be maintained and cleaned. it needs to be insured, if i'm sensible about the investment and don't want to risk a total loss.

the watch isn't particularly liquid, either -- finding a buyer can be hard. plus, the item is unique. one share of msft is indescernable from the next, but this watch might have the wrong band, a scratch, a bad maintenance record, a crushed presentation box, or ... ?

if you want to buy yourself a watch as jewlery or a statement piece or a conversation starter, go for it. make sure you like the watch for the watch, not for any financial plan you've got. it might not be something you can sell in the future because peopel are less interested in watches all the time -- they're antiquated. the market is small. you might pick something that's unpopular in the future -- not way to tell.",1,,mikeblas,0

it‚Äôs difficult to consider that immoral if you‚Äôre also willing to invest in companies that grow on the back of children in cobalt mines or sweatshops. 

people seem to have a problem with this because they see it as exploitation here at home, but many of the same people will happily put their money in things like tracker funds or apple stock, for example, growing on the back of global misery. 

out of sight, out of mind? people in glass houses and all that. 

i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs more exploitative than those things. 

you also need to consider that there is a need for a rental market. students, people who move around a lot for work, young people who just don‚Äôt know where they want to put down roots etc. 

the immoral bit for me is the landlords who charge a fortune and never fix anything. having tenants sitting with no heating or hot water for weeks on end, causing health problems by not fixing damp problems, using every trick in the book to keep as much of their deposit as possible. 

there‚Äôs a need for rental properties and it‚Äôs going to be filled by individuals using a couple of properties to supplement their retirement income, massive landlords who air b&amp;b everything in a city centre, or huge companies. the same huge companies many of the people moaning about it will end up investing in through their pensions or isas.

slum landlords who treat their tenants like shit and people who are air b&amp;bing everything in sight can fuck off, and i don‚Äôt want to push more power to huge companies and banks, but i‚Äôm alright with people using a few properties to supplement retirement.

there is a need for rental properties and until the housing market took off after n the 1970's the vast majority of new properties built were by landlords. there always have been and always will be rental.

the issue is that property companies control the housing market limiting the number of houses built to keep profit margins high. more houses could be built but investors, shareholders, banks and the government do t want that as it would have a negative impact on house prices.

the only people that would benefit from a drop in house prices are people that don't own a property which are precisely the people that need to be renting too keep the landlord and banks happy.

1642095644,"people should realize there are different types of fiat. the big distinction is if the issuer of the fiat currency can issue new fiat at will, or each new issuance comes with a liability. the reason why countries like zimbabwe currency failed is because the government can print endless amounts of money with nothing backing them and no mechanism to remove them from circulation in the future. plus its worse that they are physical cash.

would the us go into hyperinflation? no, unless congress changes how the federal reserve is chartered and what the dollar is. currently all dollars are backed by something. the federal reserve isn't allowed to create new money, they can simply create currency by holding assets. every dollar the fed ""printed"" is backed by something on their balance sheet. they cannot simply make new money. when the value of the assets on the balance sheet goes down, for example they bought an apple stock at $200 and now its $150, now there is a difference and by law the us treasury must always cover the liability. if the fed makes a profit that goes to the treasury. the fed is always at $0, assets minus liabilities.

the vast majority of the balance sheet is us treasury bills, aka government debt. the us treasury sends the fed an iou (i know by law the treasury cannot sell bonds directly to the fed, they sell to banks and banks sell to the fed, but lets simplify things), the fed ""prints"" currency, the treasury spends currency and circulates the money into the economy. same as zimbabwe. not so fast! the treasury now has  a debt, a lability. remember, every dollar is someone's lability. its a debt based system. now the us government has to collect taxes from the economy to pay interest on its debt and repay bonds when they are due. this removes money from the economy. mechanisms like this did not exist in zimbabwe.

furthermore, as most currency is not physical, we cannot have the memes of buying bread with $100,000,0000,000 usd in the future. where will you even get that money?

1642098553,"while the number itself isn‚Äôt accurate, the ussr did carry out a massive campaign of violence against religious leaders in 1937-38 which killed or imprisoned the majority of those who had survived earlier, less systematic campaigns of violence. 

the exact reasons why 1937 was the year violence escalated so radically tie into the overall rationale behind the great terror‚Äôs turn toward mass violence. the outbreak of the spanish civil war heightened stalin‚Äôs fears of internal counterrevolution and disorder if war broke out. rising tensions with nazi germany and japan made that conflict appear imminent. nikolai yezhov, the chief of the nkvd from fall 1936 and a firm believer in major conspiracies, supported more serious measures against potential enemies. (1) ironically, this happened just a year after the newly crafted ‚Äústalin constitution‚Äù guaranteed freedom of worship and returned the right to vote to previously disenfranchised religious leader

throughout the spring-summer 1937, religious leaders and other ‚Äúsectarians‚Äù were identified as a serious threat to the regime, actively organizing conspiracies to undermine it. 

in the february-march 1937 plenum of the central committee, a number of speakers noted the risk of enemies of the people, naming specifically ‚Äúsectarians‚Äù, penetrating the lower rungs of soviet power by running in, disrupting, or otherwise interfering in the upcoming 1937 elections. (2) on march 27, an nkvd circular ordered the strengthening of investigative work against clergymen, emphasizing the need to protect upcoming elections and to destroy any and all anti-soviet religious organizations and practitioners. (3) the nkvd of ukraine issued materials on this topic in april related to regional ‚Äúsectarian‚Äù subversion. (4) across the board, regional party and nkvd leaders harped on religious leaders as counterrevolutionary masterminds. 

by the end of june 1937, the steady stream of materials on counterrevolutionary groups led stalin to order a final, decisive blow against all groups perceived to be enemies simultaneously. on july 2 all regional leaders were invited to submit lists of ‚Äúkulaks and criminals‚Äù from their respective territories, dividing them into categories to be shot or imprisoned 8-10 years. (5) the open-ended nature of this request invited a wide variety of clarifications and additions, including about religious leaders. many responses included requests to include clerics, mullahs, and other ‚Äúsectarians‚Äù in the compositions to be punished. (6)

because of this, nkvd operational order 0047 issued on july 30th after the collection of regional materials specifically mentioned religious leader multiple times, explicitly naming them as targets of the first of many ‚Äúmass operations‚Äù to begin in early august. per stalin‚Äôs instruction, all those arrested were to be ‚Äútried‚Äù by troikas in absentia, usually only with cursory review of their cases ‚Äì more often than not the troika simply signed off on ‚Äúalbums‚Äù of cases each day. (7)

in his september 8th report on the initial wave of arrests, yezhov included an entire section on religious ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù uncovered during the operation: (8)

&gt;church-sectarian counter-revolutionary underground

&gt;the presence of a broad church-sectarian insurgent underground, which is now being revealed, deserves serious attention. a large number of church-sectarian counter-revolutionary formations are being revealed in the western, gorky, moscow, sverdlovsk and other regions.

&gt;as the investigation establishes these formations, consisting of priests, sectarians, monastic elements, former kulaks and white guards, for many years conducted active insurrectionary work, organized former kulaks, created sabotage and wrecking groups from them on collective farms, prepared the commission of terrorist acts, carried out a wide counter-revolutionary propaganda and agitation.

&gt; in the western region, a large insurgent organization of baptist antiwar members was discovered, created by a sectarian preacher polufakin, associated with german intelligence. the organization had its branches in 10 districts of the region. in the case of this organization, 102 people were arrested.

&gt; in the gorky region, the church-monarchical organization of the former kulak of the monk savin is being liquidated. the organization covered several districts of the region and consisted of former kulaks, wandering priests, monks, ""wanderers"", etc. communication between the members of the organization was maintained through itinerant nuns. the organization conducted counterrevolutionary propaganda and agitation, distributed anti-soviet leaflets, worked on the preparation of terrorist acts and amassed insurgent cadres.

&gt; in the chelyabinsk region, in the course of the investigation into the cases of the arrested, an insurgent-terrorist organization of churchmen, representing a bloc of representatives of various religious movements, was uncovered. according to the testimony of the arrested bishop vyatkin, the organization has illegal rebel nests, with more than 300 members, in a number of districts of the region. the organization is headed by a rebel spiritual council headed by a priest, a former white officer bormotov. in the largest districts of the region there are district headquarters. the organization set itself the task of conducting sabotage work and organizing an uprising at the time of the outbreak of hostilities.

&gt; the organization was associated in moscow with metropolitans vitaliy and sergiy.

&gt; a church-sectarian insurgent organization of the same nature, uncovered in the syksunsky district of the sverdlovsk region, closed in its counterrevolutionary work with elements of the trotskyites and rights.
in general, yezhov‚Äôs report stressed the need for further arrests and investigation into all target groups, including religious officials. 

throughout fall 1937, stalin continued to emphasize to yezhov the importance of repressing religious leaders: (9)

1642128929,"this is a great way to lie with normalization.  investment performance is not based on looking at 1/1/21 to 12/31/21 volatility and ending price.  btc's volatility makes it a very poor investment for most people with biweekly paychecks.

if you had invested $1000 every paycheck into btc or aapl (assuming fractional investing like robin hood) last year buying it at the adjusted closing price from yahoo finance on pay day (1/8/21-12/24/21) on standard 26 pay period schedules ($26,000), your portfolio today (1/13/22) would be worth $32,014 of aapl stock or $24,133 of btc.

i did a quick and dirty model using yahoo finance adjusted closing prices between aapl and btc (aapls were apparently offset 1 day versus btc, but it makes no real difference) you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/vlt2pn1).

so as of today (1/13/22):
aapl would have an roi of 23.13% + dividends (i didn't calculate dividend yield, but it's an extra .5%)
btc would have an roi of -7.26%

ok, so that's a little unfair since btc dropped from $47,665.43 on 1/24/21 to $47,178.13 today (1/13/22).


on 12/31/2021, aapl's porftolio would have been $33,014 or a 26.98% roi, and btc would have been $26,252 or a 0.97% roi on 12/31/21.

this is intrinsic to high volatility investing and not bitcoin specifically.  any weekly/daily/monthly style of periodic investment is going to have a poor annualized return with btc versus aapl's consistent growth.

the only way to get consistently good returns in volatile markets is to day trade and try to ""beat the market"" (gamble and get lucky, or set buy/sell thresholds in your portfolio to mitigate losses).  such trading activities are not appropriate for 99.99% of investors, let alone the population at large.

[this is what i suspect will happen. my guess is that we'll get 2-3 hikes then the fed will find some reason to become more dovish and they either stop tightening or reduce rates again. if inflation starts dropping quick, which it almost certainly will as supply chains recover in 2022, they're not going to continue raising rates unless they want a recession.  the point i'm making is that there is a narrative out there that rates are going up therefore you need to sell all of your small cap growth names for bank stocks which have practically no growth and are trading at their highest valuations in years. while in reality rates are realistically going to go up maybe 0.5% - 1% and are unlikely to even return to pre-pandemic levels any time soon. based on my models we should expect this 0.5% - 1% increase in rates to reduce fair value on the s&amp;p500 by 10% - 20% which sounds a little scary, but in reality that could be done with a ~10% drop in prices over a 6-12 month period so long as growth remains strong.  at the same time small-mid cap growth stocks are trading a levels not seen for years. it's true a lot of these are unprofitable and trade at high pe/ps valuations therefore will be hurt more by rate increases, but i feel people are not putting this into context. for example, msft, perhaps one of the most popular cloud stocks held by people here trades today at a pe of 35 and a ps of 13. growth is decent, but still only around 15-20%. if we compare this to a mid-cap growth cloud stock widely regarded here are excessively valued, crwd, we see that it's sitting at a ps of 30 and is yet to make a profit. but while crwd is certainly more expensive on paper, it's has an annual growth rate just shy of 100% and unlike msft it's also not trading at it's highest valuation ever, but relatively inline with what it was trading at pre-pandemic. yeah, you pay a little more than x2 in terms of the ps multiple but you're getting something like 3-5x more growth. and crwd is just one stock, i could give you countless with similar stories right now, some with even more attractive valuations.  what the previous commenter is saying about interest rates and small cap growth valuations is true, but it's not factoring in the fact that the stocks you would typically want to sell are ridiculously cheap right now while the stocks that it apparently makes sense to rotate into are ridiculously expensive compared to their historic valuations. it's also not factoring in the fact that the fed is probably going to struggle to get rates back to pre-pandemic levels any time soon, plus a 0.5 - 1% increase in rates is hardly worth noting, yet people are actually like rates are about to normalise to levels where it makes sense to own bank stocks.  apologies for the rant. just explaining / venting my frustration.](/r/stocks/comments/s32e1r/why_are_nasdaqs_small_and_micro_caps_crashing/hsk7o6w/)

[very bullish. roku has yet to fully monetize. some of the biggest profits comes after active account growth starts slowing - look at aapl. most of its growth came after it's active accounts slowed down.  streaming environment is very favorable for roku. plutotv, tubi, peacock, and other avod's are some of the fastest growing streaming services, growing faster than even netflix, and roku takes a 30% cut of all ad inventory from those channels. roku channel has also grown significantly and they get a 100% cut of ad inventory there. we haven't even mentioned the fact that tv ad spend budgets are rapidly transitioning to streaming ad spend.   the market is slowly tilting towards smart tv's over smart dongles. roku holds a very strong position in the smart tv market, with more tv manufacturers on-board than any other os. their lean, efficient code allows their partners to sell their tv's at a lower cost than others. roku tv's also start up faster and run better - tcl recently had to pull it's googletv lineup from sale due to performance issues - https://androidcommunity.com/tcl-google-tvs-pulled-out-from-best-buy-due-to-performance-issues-20211213/#:~:text=tcl%20google%20tvs%20pulled%20out%20from%20best%20buy,made%20tcl%20discontinue%20selling%20its%20google%20tv%20lineup.  on the original content side, roku has already proved it can produce profitable original content. they were able to leverage their quibi content to launch further into original movies and tv's, with a focus on shows that appeal on the avod side like family, kids, reality, etc. their original zoey's extraordinary christmas was the most watched show on the roku channel.  on the financial side, even with the big losses due to supply chain pressure roku was still able to improve their margins to over 50%, with steady improvement every quarter. higher margins means that every dollar of revenue earned by roku becomes more valuable.  their margins have been improving every quarter, with the hardware business increasingly becoming insignificant in terms of affecting their revenues. their margins, even with losses on hardware, is comparable to cloud companies like fastly.   granted, they don't come close to the margins net gives, thus they will never reach a 20-30x sales valuation like net will with 80% margins (in fairness though, how many companies have 80% margins like net?).   their hardware business, i wouldn't price at more than 2x sales. but their true margins on platform is hidden by their hardware losses and a lot of hidden value will be released here. i wouldn't hesitate to pay 10x sales for their high margin platform business, which will reach $3.5 billion in 2022.   just going by platform, they are already a strong buy at current prices. going by my 10x sales multiple for their platform business, i wouldn't be surprised if roku is over 280 a year from now.  under $140, roku will be at deep value territory, as attractive a buy as $viac was at $28 (another stock i'm in, come on over to r/viac), with a good chance to double your money.  ps: this is like the 4th fucking time roku has dropped over 50%, and it's the same tired narrative every single time. newcomers to the market never learn.](/r/stocks/comments/s3g39p/what_are_your_thoughts_on_roku/hslczxf/)

$aapl prodaje skup hardver, jeste da upeglano radi, ali mnogi u svetu ce da izaberu telefon od $500 umesto telefon u $1200. osim toga apple maps je mnogo losiji od google maps, a i neke druge aplikacije. trenutni pe ratio 30, ne znam koliki je earnings yield, ako ode 10y t na 4.5%, ima veci earnings yield.

$msft, zadnji put kad sam racunao (oktobar 4) procenjeni earnings yield je bio 2.78%, sa 10% growth rate na period od 10 godina je ispala losija investicija od par drugih ticker-a, npr. od spg sa 0.02% growth rate. racunao sam sa drugacijim tax rates, sad ne znam da ponovo proracunam sta bi ispalo.

$pfe ne pratim bas, otvorio sam jedan od zadnjih finansijskih izvestaja, pa vidim da se neki lekovi bolje prodaju, ali gomila zarade je od vakcine, i postoji mogucnost da posle omirona ljudi ne budu mnogo zainteresovani za vakcinaciju, niti potreba da se nateravaju (osim starijih i razicnih), osim toga za 4 godine moze se smatrati da je bolja neka druga vakcina, ili smanjiti profit margina zbog konkurencije.

this week... an emotional rollercoaster doesn't even begin to describe it.

to make things even worse, my grandfather is soon to be hospitaled due to hemorrhage in his eye which took like two thirds of it. i really hope he will be fine and pray that an operation wouldn't be necessary.

on the bright side, i got my motorcycle seiba, just a day before gil's rate up banner. this is [my figure support list](https://imgur.com/a/3g7cyxq) as of now. okitan bought from nvda stock profit, eresh - from tsla &amp; nflx, artoria - from mstr &amp; coin. hopefully i can add more there :)

putting a lot of money into apple right now doesn't seem like a great advice. i'd say there's maybe space for a 20-30% movement (an estimate taken totally out of my ass), and that's another trillion in valuation.

1642188454,"this is such a good example of how much people misunderstand the crypto space. 

first of all, crypto is not a pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme. those are both types of frauds where the criminals misrepresent where the money that they're paying early investors is coming from. it involves lying and is illegal.

every investment in the world only goes up when more and more people want to invest in it. this is called supply and demand. the price of a stock, or commodity or any security will go up if there is more demand for it and down if there is less demand. this is true for apple stock and tesla stock and the u.s. dollar and the yen as well as bitcoin and every other token. so, yes, there's a sense in which a growth stock or a currency benefits from a flood of people wanting in on the project. but that doesn't make it a pyramid scheme or fraud anymore that it makes apple stock a pyramid scheme or fraud. and it's literally how all investments work.

yes, there's an impact to the environment. it's dwarfed by the impact to the environment of the fiat systems currently in place. it's dwarfed by the impact to the environment of the internet in general. it's dwarfed by the impact of american automobiles. impacting the environment isn't in and of itself a deal breaker. one just needs to weight the costs and benefits of a project.

cryptocurrencies, unlike many other industries, have been making huge strides to solving this problem. ethereum 2.0 will cut the energy consumption by a huge margin. there are many blockchains out there that are carbon neutral. this is a problem to be solved. and it's being solved.

you say that if someone steals your crypto you can't get it back. if someone steals your cash, the same thing is true. except, it's also not true.  law enforcement will pursue it in both cases. and the blockchain makes it very hard to get away with it. i had $250,000 worth of btc stolen from mt. gox in 2014. the perpetrators of the crime were arrested two years ago. and i'm getting  a lot of my money back in a month or two from now.

or look at the case of that hacker who stole a few hundred million from an exploit about 4 months ago. it was spotted right away and the money was tracked to a wallet. the wallet is anonymous but the word was put out immediately to block transactions from that wallet. the hacker had the money but he literally now had no way to do anything with it. so, he wrote a letter saying that he's giving it all back and he only did to ""test the security"" of the blockchain. good luck having that happen with cash or fiat money.

i genuinely don't understand how the mainstream memes about crypto have become distorted from the reality of crypto.",-2,,anangryfix,0

'well ok fine even if we agree that gates has a vested interest in microsoft's success due to his having transferred much of his stock into his charity, and that the charity in question, while sometimes nice, is also further enriching the gates' and their rich buddies while turning africa into a neo-feudalist nightmare ([and starting to do the same in the us, by the way](https://www.vox.com/recode/22528659/bill-gates-largest-farmland-owner-cascade-investments)), it's not like those things are connected! it's not like the foundation is investing in the mining and research of lithium and other metals in the area, causing the damage they claim to be fixing with their public health programs!'

with that said, you can check out the near validators and thier stats at explorer.near.org/nodes/validators

i have personally been staking with epic.poolv1.near. they're currently #7 and have had 100% uptime in the few weeks that i've been delegating to them. they currently only take 1% of rewards. 

as bailey_xii said, you can minimize risk by delegating with multiple validators. metapool is an ok option as well, but i personally like being able to stake directly from near wallet. also metapool rewards are paid in $meta, not near, so you'll have to decide if you like that token. 

you can stake with aurora.pool.near which takes 100% of the near rewards, but gives you aurora tokens. dyor here, because 1 i don't know how much aurora you'll be getting, and 2 under thier status in the near validator listing page i linked above, it reads ""kickout"". i haven't yet taken the time to do any digging into that yet. i did come across something in the validator channel of near's discord, but that's not really a place for dumb questions from a noob like myself.

your apple stock would fall in value because a big part of investments is the percieved increase in future value and apple just showed that the apple stock has questionable future value because the company isn't going to actually put its new products under it.

1642296736,"if you are a singaporean tax resident, you do not pay capital gains tax on your non-property investment locally. with regards to overseas investment, there is no capital gains tax. depending on where you invest in, there may be withholding tax on dividends, but singapore do not have foreign-sourced income tax. this seems complicated but think of it this way: most countries withhold some taxes when income is flowed out of the country in some ways. when the income comes in to a country, there may be tax as well.   


so i am saying that some investments overseas you have to pay withholding tax on dividends when it leaves the country but when it enters singapore, there is no additional foreign-sourced income tax. 

for example if you buy a dividend stock domiciled in the us, there is a 30% withholding tax and if you buy a dividend stock domciled in china , there is a 10% withholding tax. when both these dividends enter singapore there is no tax upon entering. 

depending on where your investments is, if the person passes away or inherits money there may be estate tax (death tax) or inheritance tax. this is subjected to the estate tax and inheritance tax rules of where the investment is based. 

a natural solution to replicate something like the ftse global all cap indexfund is to use interactive brokers to buy ireland domiciled ucits etf listed on the london stock exchange. there is no dividend withholding tax on the fund level (div from irish fund to singapore investor) but underlying there is still withholding tax but since ireland have a double taxation treaty with us, the underlying stocks are taxed 15% instead of 30% (for example in the fund there is a apple stock, when apple pays a dividend to the fund, the dividend only shave off 15% instead of 30% in taxes)

irish ucits funds also currently are not subjected to estate taxes.

since ftse global all cap is like a msci all country world allocation, an ideal etf is the vwra or the isac. you can google up these two ticker symbol. 

the commission through interactive brokers work out to be 0.05% per trade and the currency conversion is spot.

1642315794,"my wife and i decided to switch to apple when the iphone 13 pro released. we bought two 13 pros, one watch, one ipad 6 mini, an m1 mini mac and some airpods. i haven‚Äôt been impressed with ios, os x or apple stock apps. 

both of our phones will freeze if we use messaging, safari or apollo for more than an hour. the keyboard freezes. the microphone freezes. siri hasn‚Äôt been improved since i had an iphone 6s. maps is lacking, we both installed google maps. 

ios has poor work flow. the back buttons aren‚Äôt always in the same place. some times you can swipe left and other times you have to hit a button. sometimes you flick down or other times you hit done. if an app is in landscape you can‚Äôt use the normal home gesture from the portrait orientation, you have to do it from landscape. so if i‚Äôm using an app in landscape and i set the phone down then i pick it up later holding it in portrait the home position doesn‚Äôt work. so i have to rearrange the phone in my hand to get it to go home. that is absolutely ridiculous. the home gesture should always work if the device is being held in the portrait orientation.

the mac mini has emptied my custom folders in the dock several times. i even had to use command line to reset/kill the dock to fix it. the folders that got emptied couldn‚Äôt be deleted. you can‚Äôt drag them to trash. you have to add two files into it then remove one of them to make the folders deletable. it wouldn‚Äôt update my iphone either it failed and got stuck. workflow is weird you have to use import and export and can‚Äôt just drag and drop files. this is especially weird with pictures where it won‚Äôt retain the correct dates unless you import them. i basically bought it just to arrange the wife‚Äôs 50gb of photos into monthly/yearly albums. 

siri hasn‚Äôt been improved since i had a 6s. dictation is still horrendous and it doesn‚Äôt use context or location to answer simple questions. i can be in the parking lot of a retailer and ask what time it closes and it still wants me to pick out of a list. that‚Äôs just silly. it also switches words, uses the wrong word for the context (accept/except) or often uses slang or simply misspelled versions of words altogether. 

the keyboard doesn‚Äôt let you touch to put the curser in between letters in a word or just refuses to let you quickly get to the front or end of a word. using the spacebar trick to move the curser is cool but it gets old when a quick touch would be better which has worked great on android for years. there is no user/custom dictionary. i can‚Äôt change button layout and apple versions of swiftkey also lack options and layouts found in the android version.

safari freezes on anything with some ads and an embedded video. it gets hijacked by any media type site i go to. ads take it over. videos auto play without touching them just by scrolling by and often web link buttons can‚Äôt be pressed. 

the camera is ok but it does this weird thing where once you get closer than about 10 inches to an object in photo mode, it switches the super clear lens for a worse quality one. this can‚Äôt be turned off. backing up an inch or so switches it back to the clear lens. super annoying. 

ios has some weird quarks too. i can‚Äôt swap the notifications with command center shades. touching the top of the screen scrolls whatever you are on to the top. you can‚Äôt turn this off! the far left home screen can‚Äôt be disabled. ios also can‚Äôt handle many file types. you can‚Äôt add downloaded, messaged or emailed songs to music without doing it on your mac then syncing it with your iphone. 

the ipad mini is cool and we got the newer apple pencil for it. getting to the open apps screen is annoying though you have to swipe up twice where the iphone it‚Äôs just once. also i wish the home gesture location was always active and didn‚Äôt change with the screen orientation. if i pick it up and unlock the screen and it still has an app running in landscape mode but i am holding the tablet in portrait mode it should let me activate the home gesture from the way it‚Äôs being held. the iphone should be the same way. if i‚Äôm holding the device up-and-down then the home button should be at the bottom of the screen no matter what is currently on the screen.

1642339574,"i got to preface what im about to say that these are just things to look into / research. if there is a crypto bubble and regulation takes place theres a good chance $hbar will rise from the ashes compared to all thanks to their gc. but if people getting into crypto are going the privacy route then there will be a market there too which ill get into. the answer to your original question though is that a good chunk of crypto is currently being bought because of hype rather than a proper evaluation (like $doge $shib $floki $ada). currently crypto is so illiquid and still young that $btc and elon musk tweets can control the market, when btc dumps then theres a good chance a majority of the market does too. one day, alts like $hbar will detach itself from btc movements when the market matures. another thing is only about 35-40% of hbars supply is released so the price can drop as more are released, some people actually prefer to buy when all tokens are unlocked so price movement is easier to track. moving on heres some to look into and its going to take some time but you will have a better understanding of the crypto market. 

the $hbar holders that diversify a bit usually hold $algo (algorand) too so that might interest you to look into them. 

a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù or somewhat of a direct competitor to $hbar is $ftm (fantom). its had a decent rally the past month because theres a few defi projects you can get stable coin yields. some are quite risky but for people that like to explore defi that push boundaries and take risk then theres projects under ftm you can check out like tomb finance or reaper farms for starters. a popular developer (daniele sestagali) is trying to release a project on ftm with andre cronje (yearn finance / yfi dev) and its having quite the hype in defi circles. i will note that hedera could likely sue fantom, you can check this sub for more details here regarding hbar vs ftm.

$kda / kadena is marketed to be 480000 tps with 1.5 second finality and be the truly scalable proof of work blockchain. yet to be actually battle tested and still proof of work.

terra $luna has its anchor protocol where you can earn up to 20% apy on luna‚Äôs algorithmic stable coin $ust. terra also has their crypto equivalent of stocks in its mirror protocol where you can buy the crypto version of say $tsla $aapl etc. few protocols people looking at here to release are leserve dao and kinetic money. just need to note that sustainability of yields is something you got to question at times.

oasis network ($rose) is like polkadot / $dot in the sense that its a layer 0 with its paratime but the difference is you arent fighting for a parachain auction slot and you can just make your own paratime. if that didnt make sense just read a bit more into polkadot $dot. the focus with $rose though is its private smart contracts and also staking your data. the privacy side for defi will make for interesting ways for private lending and private automated market makers. 

thorchain / $rune is a layer 1 that is trying to be the backbone for multichain / crosschain swaps allowing users to swap native eth for native btc for example. what interests people here is people can stake btc or eth or stable coins and earn anywhere between 20-40% apy on their asset with impermanent loss protection. people do this to provide liquidity for the cross chain swaps and they get paid from the fees of transactions. 

cosmos / $atom is touted to be another ethereum ‚Äúkiller‚Äù. all layer 0s/1s alts are trying to be the ‚Äúethereum killer‚Äù. cosmos‚Äô sdk lets retail developers make their own cosmos blockchain projects that is cross chain compatible. $hbar is faster but this is still worth a look into imo.

you most likely heard of ethereum. im not a big fan of eth for multitude of reasons like ridiculous transaction fees, its slow and its too big of a marketcap to make decent gains. i only bring this up as its the 2nd biggest crypto by market cap and everything is trying to replace it. to my understanding eth still has the most projects built on it and hosts most of crypto nfts including the big ones like punks and bayc. eth still has farms and yields you can participate in if you are willing to pay over $100-$500 just to transact. olympus dao ($ohm) was launched on eth and imo it was the biggest and most ground breaking defi project of 2021, in october - december we saw the crypto market flood with a lot of $ohm forks on various chains most of which were pump and dumps or rugs. $ohm is 100% worth a proper look into just to get a grasp of its appeal but ultimately its end goal. 

polkadot $dot is another popular one thrown around with $eth and $ada because of gavin wood and charles hoskinson being co founders of ethereum but made their own crypto projects $dot and $ada respectively. polkadot lets developers make their own ‚Äúblockchains‚Äù (parachains) that are app specific and enable each parachain to be interoperable with other parachains. $hbar better in terms of trilemma tech but at least retail can join the parachain crowdloans. $glmr / moonbeam is the one to look for here under the polkadot umbrella as it was one of the biggest to win a parachain slot auction. 

honorable mentions are $one $sol $avax $htr $egld $dag $ada $xrp and $xpr (proton). would only look into in really spare time, they have market relevance but tech and team wise $hbar is overall superior. $sol network has been down a few times already as it cant handle the throughput. $ada is really big on peer review, too big on it imo. $htr is a proof of work blockchain but tries to be the wordpress of crypto.

on the plus side for the auto maker, however, is widespread optimism about the outlook for electric vehicles. analysts have been weighing in with upbeat commentary this year. one analyst thinks nio‚Äôs american depositary receipts can double in price, while another sees nio‚Äôs sales surging 50%.

dnb asset management bought 144,250 more nio adrs to end the fourth quarter with 833,746 adrs.


the manager also added 60,837 nikola shares to end 2021 with 249,443 shares. nikola stock tumbled 35% in 2021, and so far this year it has gained 2.1%.

nikola removed an overhang on the shares in december by agreeing to pay $125 million to settle civil fraud charges with the sec, without admitting or denying the agency‚Äôs findings. later that month, nikola posted a photo of its first customer delivery and promised more were on the way. in january, nikola announced that it had an agreement to sell an initial 10 electric trucks to usa truck ( usak ) in a deal that gives the trucking company and broker an option to buy 90 more vehicles. the news sent shares higher.

1642351728,"like most other people my biggest mistakes aren‚Äôt that interesting, just selling stocks too early or thinking i could time the market.

sold a bunch of apple stock in 2016 because i was young and dumb and wanted to buy cool shit. i could buy so much more shit now!

sold tsla in 2020 because i got tired of the volatility. ouch‚Ä¶

sold amd in 2018 because i was convinced that a certain sub which shall not be named was just hyping up a shitty stock for no good reason. 

bought puts on spy in 2016 instead of buying shares since i was convinced it would crash. 

basically the opportunity costs have been pretty large.",1,,cristiano-potato,0
1642352989,"those are two different things mate. 

1.	apple stock
2.	the us dollar

if everyone tried to sell apple stock at the same time, it would crash and be worthless (assuming no one is buying)

the us dollar is irrelevant in this case. we‚Äôre talking about apples stock.",3,,drilkmops,0
1642354828,"i was actually comparing three different things, mate. and i was responding to this:

&gt;every asset has value because we collectively say it has value. if ""everyone tries to cash out"" of their apple shares, or us dollars or whatever asset, it will crash in value, same as crypto.

the statement is true but fails to take into account intrinsic value. 

1. apple stock has intrinsic value in that it is a very profitable company with strong earnings and looks like it will continue to be so. 

2. the us dollar has intrinsic value in that, at least for now, the us military projects its power and influence globally to protect its economic interests.

3. i was implying that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and is propped up far more by consumer sentiment than the other two.

so if for some reason, a bunch of apple shares were sold all of a sudden, then yes, the value would plummet. but wise investors would see that as an opportunity and snap those shares back up and then the price goes back up. if bitcoin mining continues to get more difficult and shut down around the globe, investors might jump out and not get back in even if the price plummets because the risk might be too high.",6,,Cycleoflife,0

1642365637,"market drastically outperforms housing in any location in any timeline. there is no scenario where buying property for cash would yield as much return as market. leverage is the only thing that adds value here. almost any stock market index increased more than 100x since 1967. canadian housing (one of the fastest growing markets in the world) increased 10x. us market increased 5x. yes some subsets of market such as vancouver may have increased 100x but that is not average that is cherry picking a winner. as a comparative apple stock value increased 2,000 times in same period and there are quite a few others that increased several hundred to few thousand times from the 80s making compunded investment since 1967 dozen thousand times more valuable.

leverage is only thing that made investment in housing valuable in the past.",1,,ujoksimovic,0

&gt;canada has approved pfizer's covid-19 oral antiviral treatment - canadian broadcasting corp, citing sources",3,,HuzzahBot,0
1642378557,i mean i think it will be really interesting. there has never been this level of detail recorded about this many people. i‚Äôm bullish on meta stock for this reason. i disagree with your take though that people will ever snap out of it. i think it changed everything and is here to stay and i think the implications are far deeper than a mid life crisis.,11,,Gutterpayne1,0
1642379969,"this is a great question! futures are a type of ""forward contract"" which means that you are putting down a small deposit today, in order to take delivery of a product at a specified price, at the specified date and time in the future. in reality, what this does for a trader, is allow them to post a very small amount of capital, in order to be exposed to a much higher amount of price movement.  


there are two main entities who set and control the margin required for you to purchase, and maintain a position in a futures contract, these two parties are your broker, and the cme or other commodity exchange group you are trading over. all commodities that are traded over a formalized exchange have a ""spec sheet"" or other formal explanation of all the details relating to the contract. the /mes futures contract you are referring to has a spec sheet located here: [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/micro-e-mini-sandp-500.contractspecs.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/micro-e-mini-sandp-500.contractspecs.html)  


what is important to note, is that futures require a set amount of margin that is largely independent from the underlying assets price. so for example, to purchase am /es contract through td ameritrade, it currently requires $12,650 which is an amount that is not really related to the fact that /es is currently trading at 4660.00 right now.  the /mes contract, which is 1/10th of the size of the /es contract, currently require $1,265 to take a position in. note that going long one /mes at 4660 does not mean you could lose, $4,660 instead, it means that you could lose a maximum of 23,300. this is because futures are inherently leveraged financial products. the /es contract means that your maximum loss would be 233,000 if /es went to 0.  


as for calculating how much margin you would need to continue posting as the position moved, that varies broker to broker, but generally, at the end of each day, any profits or losses will be added or subtracted to your account balance, and if your balance becomes negative, you will be margin called. so for example: if you had $5,000 in your account and purchased one /mes contract, your total available money to spend on other stuff in your account such as stocks, would decrease by $1,265. so at this point you have $3,735 left to spend in your account. now lets say that /mes goes up, and you make $500. your account balance would now show $4,235 to spend on other stuff such as stocks. this is because the value of the contract went up by $500, so you will have that $500 profit credited to your account, even though you have not sold the contract. this is a form of that ""mark to market"" accounting you ay have heard of before. your account has been marked up or down for your profits and losses, even though you have not actually sold and realized your profits yet. keep in mind that you still only have $4,235 in your account even though you started with $5,000 and made $500. this is because it still require $1,265 to hold the contract. the reverse of this situation would mean that as the price goes down, your account value keeps going down very similar to owning a stock, except remember, you are using a lot of leverage, so you can potentially lose more than you actually have in your account.  


as for calculating the profit or loss of your contract, you need to know a few things including the minimum tick size, the contract multiplier, and the tick value. the minimum tick size is the minimum price fluctuation that a contract can change by. for most stocks such as aapl, this would be $0.01, meaning that aapl stock could go from $170.62 to $170.63, however, for /mes, the minimum tick size 0.25. this means that if /mes is trading at 4650.00 it can go up to 4650.25 or down to 4649.75. this is the minimum price fluctuation for /mes.  


the tick value is the actual dollar amount of profit or loss that your account will experience for a move of 1 tick in the contract. for /mes, this is $1.25, so in our previous example, if you bought one /mes at 4650, and it went to 4650.25, you would make $1.25. if instead, you had bought /mes at 4650 and it went down 3 ticks to 4649.25, you would lose $3.75  


the contract multiplier is exactly what it sounds like. it is a multiplier that tells you how many times to multiply the minimum tick size by, in order to determine the tick value. for /mes the contract multiplier is 5, so we can tell that if /mes moved from 4650.00 to 4651.00 we would be looking at a move of 1.00 for /mes, yet we know that the multiplier is 5, so we would have made $5 on the move, and not $1. keep in mind that some contracts such as /cl (light sweet crude oil) have much larger contract multipliers such as 1,000, meaning that a fluctuation of a single penny would mean a change of $10 for our account value.  


hopefully that answers some of your questions. best of luck!",2,,chaney3,0

1642390820,"great post but i think it misses some important elements:

(1) if a business or individual is concerned about holding an inflationary currency, there are many assets they can buy (bonds, stock, etc.) which will gain in value over time, as opposed to holding a currency that will lose value.  this is in fact how cash-rich businesses and individuals operate: they hold some currency and invest the rest of their savings in assets like stock, bond, or real estate.

(2) the issue with these other assets is that they are not liquid. e.g. if i own apple stock, i can't use it to buy food.  i need to covert the apple stock to fiat first.   so part of what makes a currency special is that it can be used as a medium of exchange.   a currency is something that is broadly accepted to buy/sell goods.  apple, by my example, is a store of value but not a medium of exchange.   in other words, apple stock is an asset, not a currency.

(3) most countries have a single medium of exchange.  this makes sense because there are very powerful network effects that make it better for a single currency to dominate in a given area.  it would be very confusing, in fact, if in a given area there were multiple currencies and different goods had to be purchased with different currencies.

(4) a deflationary asset and a deflationary currency are quite different.  assets can have supply that falls and/or prices that increase and that doesn't have much effect on the overall economy.  but the currency of a given area, if it is deflationary, has a uniquely powerful economic impact because it is the medium of exchange for the area.

(5) if all the actors in an economy all at once start holding their currency (meaning spending less and investing less) then economic activity falls and investment falls.  all that will cause a negative spiral.  so the problem is not the deflation of the currency but the effect the deflation has on creating a negative spiral of activity in the economy.

(6) finally keep in mind that crypto assets with falling supply can still, via fractional reserve lending, end up with a rising supply!",1,,hesiod2,0

you're referring to *execution* of these people, the imprisoning their families and confiscation of their families possesions (i accept  that this would have amounted to very little in soviet russia, but that's not the relevant point).  i referred to the mistreatment of soviet pows post-war by the soviets themselves:

*'in 1945, about 100 filtration camps were set for repatriated ostarbeiter, pows, and other displaced persons, which processed more than 4,000,000 people. by 1946, 80% civilians and 20% of pows were freed, 5% of civilians, and 43% of pows were re-drafted, 10% of civilians and 22% of pows were sent to labor battalions, and 2% of civilians and 15% of the pows (226,127 out of 1,539,475 total) were transferred to the nkvd, i.e. the gulag'* \[source: (""–≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª"" (""military-historical magazine""), 1997, ‚Ññ5. page 32) and –∑–µ–º—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤.–Ω. –∫ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ —Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω. 1944‚Äì1951 –≥–æ–¥—ã // –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Å—Å—Å—Ä. 1990. ‚Ññ 4 (zemskov v.n. on repatriation of soviet citizens. istoriya sssr., 1990, no.4\]  

these are official stats, so must be taken with a grain of salt because soviet, and later russian, documents and stats are notoriously unreliable, to the point that some of what we are debating, notably the subject of red army soldiers raping freed soviet female pows is taboo since 2015.

i understand there are truckloads of undereducated idealists bored with western democracy and looking wide-eyed at the alluring soviet system (without understanding why is fell apart under the weight of its own bs), but, hey - reality bites.  the reds were not innocent bystanders trying to evolve humanity in any way :)",5,,fluffs-von,0

1642452707,"ok.  let‚Äôs take a step back.  to understand the market, you have to think about that there a lot of different kinds of participants.  some are fundamental investors that look at companies.  there are quants that run around.  etc etc.   so while we like to think that stocks are a reflection of fundamentals, that‚Äôs only part of the factors.  the other factors are liquidity in the system, measured by interest rates, etc.  

the time period you‚Äôre looking at depending on which period (less of an impact on microsoft given the longer time lines, but more of an impact on amazon when they went public) had a tremendous amount of gyrations due to changes in fed monetary policy.  

so when you‚Äôre looking at stock prices - especially in the 1998-2020 time period there are other factors.  for example, the fed lowered rates in 1998-1999 for dealing with the russian debt default and fears of instability in financial system because of y2k. 

that drove the dot-com bubble which they tried to deflate in early 2000 by trying to raise rates.   then 9/11/2001 hit and they drove rates down more.  those changes in monetary policy had more of an impact on stock prices in that time period than anything having to do with the fundamentals of those two companies.   

when the stock prices went up so much and became dislocated from fundamental value, they came down.  in the case of amazon it was difficult to discern whether a business was going to be made there.  microsoft just got ahead of itself.  there was a correction of the stock price after 2000 for quite some time.  same thing happened with cisco and sun microsystems.   

because microsoft stock was down didn‚Äôt mean financials were shit.  they‚Äôve always made money.   amazon is a more complex situation.  cisco has always been a great company, but great companies can be heinous investments when the valuations become disconnected from fundamentals.  

the problem is it appears that you‚Äôre drawing a straight line from stock price being bad and therefore financials have to be shit.   no.  just sometimes things reset.   

just to be clear.  great companies can be heinous investments when you overpay for them.  stocks can go down as financials go up just because there was a disconnect between the two.  

with rocketlab, what the folks here are saying i think is that (because i don‚Äôt want to speak for others) is that they don‚Äôt make money.  so hard to use a value investing lens.  while you‚Äôre focused on the launch part of the business, that may be fine (and folks here i think i will say that‚Äôs hard to have certainty on since they don‚Äôt make money).   the satellite business they‚Äôre trying to get into is somewhat speculative.   not saying it‚Äôs going to work or not but there is uncertainty.  

in terms of solaero.  you should look into the history a bit more.  solaero was originally sold by emcore to veritas capital back in 2014 for $150mm.  company changed hands from veritas to their lenders and now to rocketlab for $80mm.  all those folks took a haircut of almost 50% for rocketlab to buy it.  sure you want to declare that‚Äôs a great acquisition?   i‚Äôd just think about that a bit more and just kindly say that it‚Äôs a speculative acquisition.  unclear if it‚Äôs good or bad right now.  

not trying to be rude but really a good idea to do more reading on your own and not just take what management says.  you‚Äôd be amazed at what you find sometimes.   even footnotes in sec filings have some pretty amazing information that people miss because a lot of people don‚Äôt read those things.",6,,Vivid-Director-8971,0

1642507641,"well firstly, there are **tree** -based or **column** -based library viewers (and one **layer** -based that works similar to windows explorer folders) - depends which you prefer?

for default [album list](https://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=foobar2000:preferences:album_list) (tree) on dui go to *preferences &gt; media library &gt; album list* and create the view patterns you would like, using `|` character to make a separate tree branch.

other features to note for most (all?) library viewers -

- ""[remapped metadata fields](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=foobar2000:title_formatting_reference#remapped_metadata_fields)"" - certain fields such as `%album artist%` will display other fields if no *album artist* tag is present, i.e. it checks *artist*, then *composer*, etc. if you need it to check and display only one field, use `$meta(album artist)` instead.

- ""multi-value tags"" - using `%genre%` for example will display the complete tag as one value - ""pop, rock"", while using `%&lt;genre&gt;%` will display individual values in the list (if correctly tagged).

- ""default sorting"" - tree -based library viewers sort the playlist by the view pattern. so first tag in the view pattern is primary sort field, i.e. view ""by year"" sorts the resulting playlist by year first. when using ""by folder structure"" view it sorts by the `%path%`, so depends on folders and filenames. on the other hand, column -based library viewers will have an option in *preferences* to specify default (playlist) sorting.",1,,ghstchldrn,0

1642514831,"activision surges 40% on reports of microsoft acquisition


january 18, 2022

in what looks to be the biggest deal news of the day, xbox maker microsoft is reportedly planning to buy activision blizzard for $95/share, a premium of roughly 45% over activision's previous closing price.

big @wsj scoop hitting wire: microsoft nears deal to buy activision blizzard, sources say $msft $atvi

‚Äî cara lombardo (@cararlombardo) january 18, 2022
microsoft apparently took advantage of the fact that activision's share price had become depressed in recent weeks due to reports about the company's ""toxic culture"" (the reports had mostly focused on sexual harassment allegations and the large number of employees who had been fired over these claims). activision's shares surged 40% on the news, while microsoft shares retreated 2%.

msft has reportedly agreed to buy the established video-game maker, which has produced classic titles dating back to the 1990s, for some $50 billion, according to wsj.


the deal would be microsoft's biggest acquisition by valuation; activision-blizzard's pricetag is roughly double that of linkedin, which msft decided to buy back in 2016.

1642525047,"you are focusing on the definition of ponzi for the creator. when people say crypto is a ponzi scheme they are focused on the perspective of the average buyer. 

let's concede that no central authority is saying you will make money. crypto still requires that new ""investors"" show up tomorrow and buy coins (or old investors buy more) for you to make money. thats why its a ponzi scheme. at the end of the day once there are no more people to draw in to the scheme it will collapse like any other ponzi. 

so while you might be right that there is no central authority making this promise, i.e. perhaps no one could be convicted in court of running a ponzi scheme, for the average user the risks and mechanics are exactly the same as a ponzi scheme. 

now you might say stocks are the same because to go up other people have to buy them. this is true if you are only day trading stocks, but stocks also give you legal ownership rights in a company and sometimes a cut of the profits.

think of it this way. if everyone else decided crypto was worthless and let you buy all 21 million btc for pennies, what would you do with them all? your only option would be to try to convince people btc was still good and sell it to them.

if everyone decided apple stock was worthless and let you buy 100% ownership, what would you do? you would happily keep the company running and get paid billions and billions in profit every year.",7,,jamesbucanon116,0

there's one tumblr user who has a really odd obsession with obtaining fandom clout. they always talk about wanting to be the first person to popularize a ship or piece of media and originating certain fan theories or specific critical analyses. making posts saying things along the lines of ""i can't wait till (novel they like) gets a miniseries adaptation so it'll develop a tumblr fandom, it'll be like buying apple stock when it was 13 cents a share"". they were part of a notorious group of bnfs that never really made content like fanfics or fanart, but had a very dedicated following because they propagated ship theories and made such a big deal of being the origin of them. 

they also have a weird obsession with a teenage actor (who is now 19, but they started obsessing over him when he was 14 and they were in their 20s). making a lot of sexual jokes about him, speculating about his sexuality/hoping he would come out as gay. they even made a quiz that was like ""what 13 year old boy with a gay crush on ____ are you"" where one of the answer options involved said underage actor rubbing his genitals on your face.

there's another actor they're fixated on, this one is an adult, but they're still weird about them. again making a bunch of sexual posts about him, like a very detailed post about wanting to manifest having sex with him (also worth noting that they would make these posts on their public blog despite knowing a bunch of teenagers followed them). they also commissioned their friend to draw ship art of them with the actor and infamously made a post about how they went out for dinner somewhere and had an elaborate fantasy that they were going on a date with said actor. that post felt very tongue in cheek but they insisted the waitress could see and acknowledge this imaginary version of the man, so who knows.

there's a lot more to say about them because they're so notorious throughout multiple fandoms and have several callouts, but those are the things that stick out to me the most. i also don't want to include too many specifics but i'm sure a good amount of you will know who this is.",31,,plattykitty,0

1642532438,"&gt; he's a huge shareholder so this is him literally cashing out. 

that depends on how the deal is structured. often acquisitions like this involve the shareholders of the company being bought not receiving cash, but instead shares in the purchasing company. not all companies can easily cough up the cash price of an acquisition, so a purchase for shares is common. in that case, kotick will get microsoft stock instead of his current abk stock.

&gt; it's a bummer that the guy really does ""win"" in the end...

he'll get a lot less than if he had managed the workplace environment correctly. the price that microsoft is paying per share is around the price that the shares had before the various scandals came to light. the share price went down a lot because of it. had this not happened, microsoft would've had to pay quite a bit more than what they do now, and kotick would've been much richer.

&gt; but maybe people will sue him personally after that.

maybe, but i doubt it. i'm pessimistic about these powerful people being held accountable.",3,,Rannasha,0

&gt;  on average, according to bond, game pass subscribers **spend 20% more time playing games, play 30% more games, play 40% more genres and, crucially, spend about 20% more on gaming overall**. that could always change if game pass and other subscriptions become a bigger part of the industry overall, but bond stresses that there‚Äôs still a lot of room for overall growth, especially since xbox is tying its streaming services to game pass.

how that math and economics work out, i have no clue. there's no direct reference to software sales but i believe microsoft is banking on subscribers willing to open up their wallets to microtransactions and other in-game content without having to own the software (that brings up concerns regarding the variety of content created for the service but that's another topic). i don't do microtransactions myself so i'm a bit curious about how much that generates in the future.

my bad, *now* i understand your position. i didn't mean to say ""invest in microsoft because of game pass"" or i'm anticipating a big stock move because of game pass numbers. my fault for not clarifying my position. i only wanted some updated game pass numbers from their earnings and other data/justifications for the existence of the series s (sales relative to the x, the series s: game pass attach rate, digital sales through game pass, etc.). ""how well is the series s working"" is what i'm curious about and i just think that its relationship to game pass (and vice versa) is something to keep an eye on.

look at $atvi stock price today, it's about ~$82. which is good from where it was at last week around $65. but news just came out that $msft is buying them at $95 a share. hmmm. you could easily buy it at $82 and make a nice 15% gain when it gets sold to $msft for $95. why would people just leave free money?

that's because they still need legal approval to make the acquisition. the market has determined it's not actually worth the risk to purchase the stock up to the $95 mark because if they fail to meet antitrust laws and the deal fails, $atvi stock will fall right back to $65. and since this acquisition is the largest tech acquisition in history, it's definitely not guaranteed to pass unless it's squeaky clean.

1642563857,"oh boy‚Ä¶ i really don‚Äôt have the necessary amount of time to explain what a pyramid scheme actually is or how crypto is different but you‚Äôre way off in multiple ways.  a pyramid scheme has a clear hierarchy in which value is based on tiers and not actual ownership‚Ä¶ but any crypto or stock is valued upon the number of ‚Äúshares‚Äù held.  

if you have 1 bitcoin today and i have 1 bitcoin today‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre worth the same.  in a pyramid, i bought in earlier so my bitcoin is somehow worth more than your bitcoin at the same time or i get a fee for your bitcoin purchase.  not true of crypto.

1642567583,"first.  
 import all tools. once your population is over 150 don't bother with   
blacksmiths. the merchants will begin sending the ""big city"" ships and   
from there you can easily trade for all the steel tools you need.

coal hoarders are a menace to steel tool production. not to mention   
you'll need to mine coal and iron to produce steel tools. it's a ton of   
labor to do both. if youre going to import iron or coal you may as well   
just import the steel tools. on this same note it makes more sense to   
import both stone and iron than it does to make them. mines and quarries  
 are an eye sore that never go away and they eat away at labor. by not   
producing tools you need very little iron.

second. obviously, firewood is key. you'll notice from the screenshots   
above i've spent about 25years now importing my firewood. this is more   
of a byproduct of boredom then anything else. the truth is once you've   
got massive port centers built up you should have tons of woodcutters   
and you should be using the ports to import logs. trading firewood for   
logs is the most profitable trade in the game. firewood will always be   
needed so it's the best thing to build your economy around until you can  
 adjust to an ale based economy.

note - i did an experiment with this city once i began importing   
firewood. at one point i imported coal instead of firewood to see if the  
 citizens would use less of it to heat their homes - even waited til the  
 homes no longer had any firewood to do the math. i can confirm the   
citizens used the same amount of coal (16k) to heat their homes that   
they used firewood (16k). there is absolutely no benefit to using coal   
as a heat source in the game. the reason coal is considered more   
valuable in the game is due to the dual use it shares with producing   
steel tools. coal is heavier, takes longer to move out of the ports, and  
 provides 0 benefit over firewood as a heat source.

third. orchards are useless. i never build them either. i have near the   
end of this game built them as more of a decoration but in truth i don't  
 consider them productive enough to bother with. my biggest issue with   
orchards is every time it gets an infestation you have to cut down all   
the trees and wait 2years before it starts producing again. as well   
trees die all the time in orchards and they never seem to be able to   
fully produce the same level of food crop fields or pastures will   
because of this.

fourth  
 \- trading for fruit is the smartest way to acquire the fruit needed to   
feed your people. in fact i'd argue the beauty in this is that all the   
excess fruit can be turned into ale which is the most valuable item in   
the game relative to it's weight in the trading port. as well if you   
trade ale for fruit youre actually increasing your fruit supply in the   
long run. i prefer apples because the brewers default to brewing it when  
 you build the building - saves you a step.

fifth - you need to set ale high in the trading port. it takes 1250 ale   
to trade for 10000apples. if you set your food merchant to bring apples   
only you'll get 30k in apples per trip - 1250x3 = 3750 in ale to take on  
 the entire boat load. i actually have my ports set for 9999ale,   
9999beef, 500warm coats. this set up takes up less than half of the 60k   
inventory total (25k) and gives me 120,000 in purchasing power per port.  
 at 25ports i have 3million in purchasing power. the 26th port is used   
to regulate food/warehouses. the other reason i set ale to 9999 is   
because i want my traders constantly taking ale from the brewers. by   
clearing out the brewers theyre forcing the brewers to continue to clear  
 out my apple stock.",7,,BanishedMan83,0

1642568925,"first think about the math as if the volume does not change over dt. this would only happen if angle between ds and v does not change across dt. remember the dot product of v.n gives you the projected area in the direction of the velocity component (in this case horizontal velocity). so if ds changes it‚Äôs orientation in the flow then there is a different amount of area being projected in the flow direction. just imagine initially ds is at a 45 degree angle then rotates clockwise to horizontal, the dot product will have changed the projected area and the difference between when ds was at 45 degrees and when it‚Äôs at horizontal amounts to the volume change across dt. hope that makes sense.",1,,integrate-space_xyz,0

[just bad timing once in a while, and i like to joke about it. in this hypothetical situation, if i continue to hold nvda it will creep up over five years to $53 and i will sell with a cool $0.50/share profit and then it will jump to $170 within a month.  however, if i hold at $53 it will trade sideways between $50-$53 until the world economy collapses. even if the company makes $500 billion/year in profits for the next decade, if i hold, the max share price would be $53.23 until one week after i sell. for one week i would be like ""man, i'm glad i got rid of that without a loss."" the next week it would be $75.](/r/stocks/comments/s6sw7u/you_need_to_calm_down/ht6ozuz/)

1642609925,"you keep talking about 2018 and out which 100% misses my point. 

if you made your millions by starting to invest in 2018 you probably weren't lucky. but you're also talking about a totally different breed of people. 

the people who invested in crypto in 2018 are comparable to the people who buy amazon or microsoft stock today. its an established market with provable trends and trading platforms.

while people who got into crypto prior to that, in 2010-2015 are like the people who invested in microsoft when it was being run by a college drop-out in a garage with no one even capable of beginning to understand what gates was doing. 

and much like people investing in microsoft before windows was a thing, the majority of people who invested in crypto prior to the late 2015 early 2016 crypto boom did it because ""haha this is a funny little venture ima put some money here and forget about it!"" and suddenly they were millionaires.

i am talking about the specific subsection of people, who prior to the late 2015 early 2016 crypto boom who became millionaires, without having a ton of money to throw at it the second things started to spike, became millionaires.

among those people specifically, it is vast majority just pure luck. my statement doesn't become wrong just because you also want to include the people who became rich buying into it when it was mainstream.

1642610612,"thanks, yeah i think apple and microsoft are competitors in some limited categories at this point, but apple's revenue is tied tightly to its digital storefronts and it's hardware ecosystem. microsoft is mostly a software company that caters to a completely different market. so long as apple doesn't infringe on the corporate business world (word, excel, outlook, etc..) i don't think the two companies see each other as tremendous threats to each other.

microsoft attempted to get into the smartphone and digital storefront market with its zune and various other devices, but none have proven all that successful. i think the surface tablet is a bit of an outlier. apple has been rumoured to be developing a vr headset and possibly a foray into gaming as well for a long time now, so maybe the two will clash in the future but i think microsoft still has a stranglehold on what they do best and the same is true for apple.

1642625877,"from october 2017 to 2021, i went from around 17k total net worth savings to 320k 

my income increased yoy but i was around the low 100ks starting and ended around 140k salary.

things i changed:

* food. i used to order delivery/eat out for every meal. every meal. i used to think i was eating cheaply by going to 10-20 dollar spots, but that adds up, especially if you get a drink from time to time. i started cooking and realized that i cut my food expenses in over half. (still going out to eat socially) this went from around 1600 to around 800
* rent: i went from paying 1650 to 1300 by going to a much-much older unit. i had more space, but fewer amenities.
* saving first: i used to save leftover funds, but once i settled into my routine, i would put forth a set amnt of my salary into my savings account. 
* smart investing: i got a bit aggressive with my saving by choosing mostly growth funds/vug/nvidia stock. if you see their share price, you can kind of see where the booms are coming from. 

* going out: i used to go out a looot. 2-4 times a week. i cut back to 2-4 times a month. also, i try to avoid taking ubers. a metro pass is 2.75 per ride, an uber is usually 15-25 dollars. that's at least 5 times as expensive.

* taking on extra jobs. i'm a contractor, so there are times in which i take on extra contractual work. i started a business and am able to write off a lot of technological expenses.

just by those first 2 points, i was saving almost an extra 1k a month, over the course of 3-4 years with smart investing, i was able to save up to buy my first property!

regarding individual stocks. i mean, assuming evgo has a fundamental business that can survive and compete in the long run, sure, rebalance away. but i feel you‚Äôre just rebalancing away your alpha.

imo, that‚Äôs a fundamental fallacy. selling winners to buy ‚Äúlosers‚Äù based on price action. even if it‚Äôs rebalancing and not closing entire positions.

wealth is created in being concentrated and purely letting the winners ride and being patient. i‚Äôm sure people must have placed the rebalance game with $aapl and other stocks, but had they just held in any level of concentration, would have clobbered the market handedly, without the rebalancing game.

feels like rebalancing (on individual stocks) is like engaging in risk and bending over to pick up pennies, when one can just wait and pick up $100 bills later on.

1642640699,"then you would know that negotiated stock awards as part of your employment contract - regardless of who you are within a company - become your ""property"" the moment the board authorizes the shares (at most companies, done quarterly though at tech companies like $atvi, the share price is locked in to your date of start and awarded in tranche later), regardless of whether you can transact them or not - the same way a company match in a 401(k) will oftentimes put the money in your account to be traded even though they haven't vested, and if you leave before the vest date they're pulled back.

&amp;#x200b;

so, if you have 3 years worth of equity, but the equity will cease to exist in 11 months, you're owed that lump sum payment.  it's just standard in the sector.    and $msft is the type of company that never lets any of its employees never have any golden handcuffs, so all atvi employees will be issued new rsu's the moment they convert over, because that's the only way to retain them.

&amp;#x200b;

i do vc/pe, and i've literally never seen any entity claw back equity from an employee because a buyout happened before the equity vested.   ever.  and if it was a common thing, you'd see question after question on quora, on reddit, etc. every time a merger happened with disgruntled workers talking about how they got screwed.  i can guarantee you there's not a tech company anywhere in this country that would dare do it.  hell, companies like amazon have $160,000 salary caps with the understanding the wage difference is made up in rsu's. nobody would ever go for that scheme if there were companies clawing them back.

[then you would know that negotiated stock awards as part of your employment contract - regardless of who you are within a company - become your ""property"" the moment the board authorizes the shares (at most companies, done quarterly though at tech companies like $atvi, the share price is locked in to your date of start and awarded in tranche later), regardless of whether you can transact them or not - the same way a company match in a 401(k) will oftentimes put the money in your account to be traded even though they haven't vested, and if you leave before the vest date they're pulled back.  &amp;#x200b;  so, if you have 3 years worth of equity, but the equity will cease to exist in 11 months, you're owed that lump sum payment.  it's just standard in the sector.    and $msft is the type of company that never lets any of its employees never have any golden handcuffs, so all atvi employees will be issued new rsu's the moment they convert over, because that's the only way to retain them.  &amp;#x200b;  i do vc/pe, and i've literally never seen any entity claw back equity from an employee because a buyout happened before the equity vested.   ever.  and if it was a common thing, you'd see question after question on quora, on reddit, etc. every time a merger happened with disgruntled workers talking about how they got screwed.  i can guarantee you there's not a tech company anywhere in this country that would dare do it.  hell, companies like amazon have $160,000 salary caps with the understanding the wage difference is made up in rsu's. nobody would ever go for that scheme if there were companies clawing them back.  &amp;#x200b;  the worst thing that can happen to an employee with equity is dilution.  that, unfortunately for them, happens an awful lot - especially when guys like me enter the picture.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s7rwkm/get_a_job_at_the_company_which_you_know_is_going/hteajcj/)

&gt; i know silent investor means something else, which is why i used ‚Äú. lets call it ‚Äúindirectly investor‚Äù.

investing in the same asset as a company doesn't create any sort of investment relation between you and them. you don't become a microsoft investor just because you both own apple stock or a a jpmorgan investor just because you both own gold. 

any asset increases in value with higher demand, so this isn't exclusive to crypto. by investing into any of them you're also potentially increasing the profit for other investors. i mean... sure, you can create a term to describe that. still seems silly to me to see this as an ""indirect investment"" though.",2,,dc-x,0

sony's stock went down about 10% over 2 days. confidence in the stock has also been shaken.

playstation is about 30% of sony's value at this point - actually more - but the point is this stock dip was purely because of shaken confidence in the playstation brand.

if the company overall lost 10%, but that's all because of ps which is 30% of sony, it stands to reason that the value of the ps brand dropped by 1/3.

sony is not only playstation but it is the biggest part of rhe company now. conversely xbox is a smaller part of msft. the acquisitions were very good news for msft but didn't really result in much of a price jump stock wise because xbox isn't a huge part of msft's profits (and they could easily survive even if xbox bombed completely). although it is worth noting the msft stock still went up when a buyer typically sees a dip after an acquisition while the seller sees a rise (atvi went up like 25%).",-2,,caninehere,0

if there's a big dip at the bell, it will v recover till 10:30-11 and then fade.  if it rips at the open, it's gonna tank.  if it's flat, it's going to bleed all day.

we've gone from buy the dip to sell the rip for absolutely no valid reason.  news channels will say it's about rate hikes, but in what universe does the prospect of going to .75 from historic lows justify the complete murder of well run companies, even ones that trade at high multiples?

does $msft or $nvda care about rate hikes? they've got more money than they know what to do with.  satya is paying 69 billion dollars cash for a white woman mobile game l, a piece of shovelware, and a 20 year old mmo.  why would sophie lose 50% of its value when 73% of their revenue is from interest, so higher rates mean more money?  really, $pypl is worth half what it was 6 months ago when it's best positioned to be the mobile payment default for the world and it's eating $sq's lunch in merchant processing?

tapering and rates account for maybe 1/5 of this drop.  as a matter of fact, historically higher rates result in higher market returns over time.

all you can do in a market like this is learn how the algos behave and trade into that behavior.  fortunately, i got a crash course in that last march/april, which was a useful tool to add to my box.  i'm up bigly on the year so far, but i'll be the first to admit the path to prosperity right now is rooted in behaving like a traditional retard.  i'm not catching bottoms perfectly, but i'm hitting the tops like ruth.",1,,NrdRage,0

1642720857,"overlaying the charts helps but, for me, it was a lesson that had to be learned to develop an intuition for minute-by-minute sentiment.  take today, for example:  chart overlays told me ""hey, everything is flying right out of the gate, it's gonna fade - so i'm gonna go ahead and sell here at the top"".   you even saw me say it this morning when i was talking about everybody piling onto a rug.  i was selling into shrek.

&amp;#x200b;

now normally, i'd have looked for an entry maybe 2-3 hours later.  and i was about to - the market had consolidated into a flat line for quite a while and selling and buying seemed balanced overall.  then i got an alert that my $pton shorts had just ripped.  this is where the intuition comes in.  i recalled 2 similar events last year where the markets were doing pretty well and then a popular name got halted suddenly, and it ended up dragging the entire market down with it.  i took losses on both of those.  it happened again in july, and i nailed it.  happened again in september, and again i was ready for it.  so when it happened today, same story.  i stopped looking for entry points - i've seen this pattern before - and even opened some shorts in names i normally wouldn't short like $aapl, which paid off.  towards the end of the day, i bought some of the things i had sold this morning back, but closed the day with a lot fewer positions than i started with, because i don't think tomorrow is going to be anything pleasant, either.    


which, intuition tells me, also means that monday is probably going to be bad.  so for the next day or two, i'm going to identify positions i have that i need to roll out.  $nvda is chief amongst them, as it got absolutely clobbered eod and in ah, so my march's that became aprils a week or so ago are now going to become junes.  you just have to develop a feel for it.",4,,NrdRage,0

1642742654,"yes and no.

the trick is to buy an asset when its price to earnings is as low as possible. 

for example, in january 2019, you could buy apple stock that earned $3/share for $37. that works out to $1 in annual income for every $12.33 you invest. today, to earn $1 in annual income with apple, you need to pay $29.34. 

this [house](https://www.realtor.ca/real-estate/23937567/586-huron-st-toronto-annex) in toronto earns \~$86k per year and is selling for $2.6m. that works out to a p/e ratio of 30.2. another way of looking at that is that the rate of return on $100 is 3.31%, which is just the inverse of 30.2. earning 3.31% is better than 1.89%, which is what the 10 yr cdn bond earns, but also has the hassle of managing tenants, etc.

now, if interest rates rise, no one will want to pay $30.2 for $1 of rental income, because they will be able to earn more in bonds. this is why assets fall in price when rates rise.

that said, if you don't invest in assets and leave your money in cash, you can lose it through inflation. essentially, to be a good investor you need to be part psychic and spread your risks. too many cdns are pinning their hopes on real estate.",2,,Johnsmith4796,0

stop whining and please and whatever you do dont kill yourself. cant make money when youre dead. nobody can track the market better than the market itself. hedge fund managers have trouble matching the market and coming out ahead. at the end of the day invest in securities you believe in and dont fomo buy if you can help it but if you have the testicular fortitude to hodl while the price of your fomo buy is creeping into the red then when it spikes to new ath you will come out ahead. but make sure to buy the dips if you do that and drive your average down.

remember when that price compresses down in a dip if you keep packing more as it compresses when the market rebounds itll expand just like it compressed and compound on itself.

hmmm, rarely does that happen. name a good gun. let's say a glock 19, or a zastava m70. buy one today at your lgs. it's not going to sell at a higher price used *tomorrow.* it's especially not going to sell at a higher price if you've put rounds through it. 25 years from now they won't fetch incredible collectable prices either.

forgotten weapons just put out a video about this yesterday or the day before. ian recommended specialized knowledge if you're trying to collect.

certainly you can get people doing panic buys, and inflation drives prices up, but those aren't persistent conditions you can depend upon.

and rarely do gun prices go up faster than a basic mutual fund, and certainly a fuckload slower than blue chip stocks, and even no-brainer tech stocks like apple and microsoft are absolutely going to out preform even the most collectable of guns. for example, if you have a pre-86 full automatic uzi machine gun in 1983 and it cost you $500, and you registered it during the machine gun ban so it's fully transferable - that would be like **the best case ever in a firearm investment** because today it might get you $25,000-$50,000. meanwhile, on a whim in march 1990 you put $500 into microsoft, today the microsoft stock would be worth almost $300,000.

speculative trading of options is dangerous. it‚Äôs a completely different mindset than trading stocks and you will almost certainly lose more than you win. with stocks all you have to do is say i think this stock will be worth more at some point down the road. and for a decent company, that‚Äôs almost always right in the long run. for options you‚Äôre saying i think the market will go above or below a set price and by a certain time and that‚Äôs a really tough bet.

&gt;you've completely ignored the facts that prices have fallen and continue to fall, the number of people at drops has fallen off a cliff and all of that lines up with cs requirements.  the more barriers they've put in place the more the numbers have dropped.

&gt;man, i feel sorry for you.  you know there were companies back in the day that sold stars.  they held databases that mapped the star you bought back to you.  then those companies went out of business and the databases went with them.  that's nft's in their current state.  if top shot goes under, if they lose their licensing deal with the nba, whatever - everything you have is worth $0.  worse than that, everything you have continues to drop in price right this second.


why even bring up star naming companies? those were worth zero even when the companies were in business. don't really understand your argument here. if apple goes under, all your apple stock is worth $0. ok, so? and again, you are being overly dramatic and inaccurate with ""everything you have continues to drop in price right this second""

&gt;that's fine, i get it, you don't want to admit that you're holding bags.  it doesn't change the fact that the price has sank as the supply of both ts and nft's has increased.  it doesn't change the fact that the demand has plummeted since ts started adding things like kyc and cs.

1642952806,"i have traded earnings strangles for more than a decade and often play msft because it has the kind of profile that often pays with this kind of trade.

before i forget to say it, an earnings strangle trade is a directionally neutral tail-event bet.

last quarter earnings date oct 27 (tue) msft you could have paid the following had you entered the trade following your strategy (except this is a strangle) - an entry at 3:24:46 pm, msft stock at 310.60 (b/a peg, not last) 312.5 call at 2.97 and 307.5 put at 2.960, friday expiry.

had you sold at open, say 9:31:08, you would have experienced a modest profit, absolute log rate of return of 2.5%. call was worth 5.85, put was worth 0.23.

had you sold about an hour later at 10:47:22 the gain would have been considerable, log rate of return at 70.75% (discrete rate of return more than 100%) because the stock continued to rise, call at 11.90 and put at 0.11.

does this imply that one should not sell at open after earnings but instead wait a few hours? not necessarily. i have documented and studied the ""trade at open vs. wait to trade"" issue with over 120 trade-tested samples (data based upon actual trades only) and the issue comes down to 50/50. for this reason, given that i buy multiple contracts, i usually, but not always, trade out half at open and half later in the day.

a similar trade for the msft 27jul21 report yielded a tiny gain of log 1.90%.

the 27apr21 report broke even exactly except for fees (tiny relative to trades).

the 26jan21 report yielded a large loss, log return -43.98%

the 27oct20 trade yielded another large loss, log return -37.63% market open, -7.42% at 10:30:27.

prior to those trades i was using a different tracking model, so i can't offer meaningful comparisons. but long-run analysis that i do shows that msft is only a marginal candidate for earnings trades. since 2018 there has not been a single earnings report that has offered a massive pop up or down (like the nflx trade earlier this week that offered up epic profits - and nflx has done that before) like nflx, aapl, fb, and goog. it is those huge tail events that make this kind of strategy pay. 

you might want to experiment with paired single contracts (i.e. 100 shares each side) to get a feel for this, and, as i have said in posting multiple times in this sub, there is no better way to learn the subtleties of options and their greeks (because they, and iv versus hv are all in play big-time), not to mention your own trading practices (great way to test your emotional control), than trading strangles.

why strangle rather than straddle? because straddle has an implied directional bias. one option is itm, the other is otm, and the itm has a higher delta. 

don't be swayed by the old specious ""iv crush"" argument. i have addressed that multiple times on this sub. this is a tail-event bet and your are betting that one of the legs moves close to one-delta. what is happening to options that are close to the money but miles away from your winning strike is of no relevance (obviously if your stock doesn't budge you suffer from iv collapse and, more important, time decay if you have an option that expires on friday, always the case with me).

i recommend this as an experiment. do not yolo or do something stupid like that. this is a tough game where a majority of trades lose (about 60% in my case) but where you can also get a blowout trade like nflx (but that will be one trade in 12, if that).

i recommend against trading tsla or any of the meme stocks (i don't trade them), they don't perform as well as the tech standards. tsla did have blowout report - when, like aapl, they announced a split.

i should add that i machine-trade with algos - i give discrete permission, thumbs up or thumbs down, but all transactions are thereafter, including limit order decision criteria, placement, and modification, are made by a linux workstation running python/numpy using the ibkr ib_insync api. that means that i get better transactions results than you are likely to get in a wildly volatile, choppy, fast-moving market.

you might consider looking at my post history. i have made many large posts on this general topic, including more strategy details.

best of luck. remember that these kinds of trades can humiliate you if you get emotional - they are complicated and hard to pull off, which is why you might want to learn more about yourself by trying one or two.

1643009873,"savings: i wouldn't say it is naive in your case. if i was really your banker and you were my client i would probably tell you it's okay in your personal situation. mostly because of the job security. rsus can be an emergency savings or house funds given how liquid they are. apple stock is relatively stable and less volatile. it would be a different story if it was a volatile stock from an unestablished company. 

home ownership: plenty of cheaper housing else where. each of my mortgages are less than your rent in a major us city. but i know you're there for work. also you don't need 20% down payment. i actually go against the grain and recommend lowest down payment. especially in such a bull real estate market. this is a whole discussion on its own. 

credit card: take away the sign up bonus and do the math on the ongoing points earned versus annual fee. math an alternative 2% cash back no annual fee. day 1 you're at $95 head start. maybe it does work for you but let math decide. i do reserve, but i make sure to justify the annual fee. also i've been getting $450 af, about to attempt again this year. also another topic for another time. 

car: sounds like you want more detail. no lender will give you 0% financing unless they basically padded the car price enough. another way to structure the deal is to add the interest charges to the car price and show 0% rate. next time you always bring in independent financing into a dealership usually from a credit union, but fintech companies are getting competitive nowadays. i wrote up a whole 'how to buy a car for the first time car buyer'. but its not like youre in the market for a car. there is no incentive on putting more on principle when its a low rate. let the math tell you. if you have extra money do you pay off 0% and save $0 or do you invest it in your betterment account and earn 10% or whatever you earned on average. 

expenses: just be more aware of what you're buying. think more about your buys and avoid impulse buys. but enjoy life too. 

investing: no, betterment fees are not associated with the funds they put you in. each fund will have their own expense ratio. betterment fees are basically, hey lets buy these funds because you're this far from retirement. oh hey you're older, lets do more bonds. you can do this on your own. simply go buy those funds yourself. you can be hands off by setting auto contribution to say fidelity, and auto buy into those same funds they have you buying. i mean you would have to reset your allocation eventually. but you're good with an aggressive portfolio for like 10-15 more years even if you had a low risk tolerance. 

car: yeah carshare got crazy. its tough to math car depreciation, and cars appreciated recently which is crazy. but having your own car brings a lot of flexibility which has its own intangible value. 

question for you: how's your job like? i'm curious.",1,,sengsta,0

es gibt grob [33k nodes](https://1ml.com/statistics), von denen 14k im netz erreichbar sind, und 11k sich die letzten 24h lebendig gezeigt haben

11k * 61 = 671000 transaktionen. wenn alle nodes den effizientesten tech nutzen. tun sie allerdings nicht, denn das war im backtest eine single channel l√∂sung und es gibt deutlich mehr channels als nodes. kannst also direkt mal 30-90% abziehen, schwer zu sagen wie viel ohne statistiken der verwendeten software. etwaige ineffizienzen im network nicht eingerechnet

so you take out a $500k loan and since you put up your $1 mil in aapl stock as collateral, you get a low interest loan of let‚Äôs say 5%.

so by years end, you‚Äôll have paid $25k in interest plus some portion of the principle - but no where near the $500k.  the bank will gladly roll that loan over because you‚Äôre super wealthy and will continue to pay that interest.

meanwhile, your $1 mil in aaple stock has grown 8% which means you‚Äôve made $80k - more than triple the amount in interest you‚Äôve paid.  maybe you have to sell a few stocks, but it‚Äôs better than selling half of them to get that $500k that you got from borrowing.

- aapl the company offers stock at ipo for $10
- bill has $10 cash in his bank account. he gives $10 to aapl and appl gives him 1 share
- sally has $20 cash in her bank account. bill is only willing to sell his aapl for $20, so sally gives bill $20. aapl has $10, bill has $20 and sally has the *equivalent* of $20 worth of stock. at this point, only $30 is circulating.
- bill earns $40 in salary that week and decides to buy his aapl stock back from sally for $40. 
- at this point, aapl has $10, sally has $40 and bill has the *equivalent* of $40 worth of stock. now, there is $50 circulating, which is a net new $20 from the previous amount of circulation. 
- days go by and no one wants to buy aapl from bill for $40. sally says ""i'll buy aapl for $10"". so now, bill has $10 cash, sally has $30 cash, and aapl has $10 cash. sally has the equivalent of $10 in aapl stock, the rest of the total circulating amount of $50 is ""sitting on the sidelines"" (or $40). so yes, the company has this difference (the $10), but all of the parties who brought in net new money to the equation are doing nothing but holding it in cash. prices of stock go up when the people that hold the equity value do not want to convert it to cash (i.e. liquidate it).

1643054488,"&gt; money can flow out of corporate equity into other assets:

correct. hence my point about ""where is it rebalancing to?""

&gt; plus money can also flow out of publicly traded securities to private investment (whether equity, debt, or other assets), from one country to another, etc.

also correct. 

&gt; investment itself is a choice between investment and spending, so people who grow pessimistic about investment returns may take the money they would've invested and just spend it on something that isn't an investment at all, like consumption or whatever.

1643055421,"&gt; sure, but you don't have 10% whole market wide changes of people saying ""ah fuck it, i'm just gonna sell my aapl stock so i can buy a boat""

i don't see why not. 

we see around 100,000,000 shares of apple change hands on any given day. we also see about 16.33 billion shares outstanding. that means on a typical day, at least about 99.39% of apple's shares aren't bought or sold (maybe the same share can be involved in multiple transactions, but that doesn't really change what i'm saying).

but the ticker price is calculated entirely using the transactions that constitute the 0.61% of apple's shares actually involved in a transaction that day, so if market sentiment representing only something like 0.1% of a company's outstanding buy-and-hold shares decides to sell, that could flood the exchange with asks, and represnt something like 20% of the volume of the trades that day, and could move prices significantly.

the money isn't going anywhere, because 99.2% of the shares still stayed put in the same accounts that they started the day in. but that little bit of activity is used to extrapolate to the value of the whole 100% of the pie.

or put another way, $16 billion of aapl transactions is only $16,000,000,000, but is used to calculate the value of the entirety of the $2,600,000,000,000 company.",3,,Already-Price-Tin,0

maybe there‚Äôs a way around it somehow, but, i‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôre going to use a security in any type of commerce. i‚Äôve never heard of anyone buying anything with shares of stock or a bond. it‚Äôs like exchanging shares of aapl stock for a tv. no idea how that works. then, on top of that, i‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôd sell it for cash since the exchanges aren‚Äôt securities broker dealers. not to mention, you‚Äôd have to get it listed on a centralized exchange like nasdaq or nyse. and that‚Äôs after they get up to snuff on the filing requirements (e.g. audited financials, regulatory approvals, legal requirements, etc.). maybe after all of that, they can get listed and traded with security broker dealers and issue another coin or something to use for commerce? again, no idea how that all ends up working. sounds like a royal mess. 

people keep bitching and moaning about a bear market. what do you think‚Äôs going to happen if that shoe drops?

be glad you‚Äôre in a commodity. the crypto exchanges that survive that mayhem. may be forced to re-list bsv just because pretty much everything out there outside of bitcoin related coins or doge is a security.

1643057564,"something is only worth what someone else will exchange/pay for it. in a moment, you never really know what something is worth until someone else offers to buy/trade something for it and you take that offer. 

in stocks/futures/options/bonds/cybercurrency, some estimate the current value of that item (asset, if you will) by what someone last paid for it. this number doesn't tell you much and can be very misleading. for example, say someone sold a single share of apple stock for $10,000usd, which was the last trade/exchange of apple stock that day. how much will the next share be worth? we don't know until someone asks for a price for someone to pay and someone pays that price. the other thing we don't know is how many were sold at that price. 1 share sold at that price is much different than 10 million shares sold at that price.

so let's say i hold 100 bitcoin and the last bitcoin bought from someone on the market sold for a million us dollars. i can easily tell myself i have 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin. 

if i wake up tomorrow and another coin sells for half a million dollars, i can tell myself i have 50 million dollars worth of bitcoin (100 bitcoin x $500,000 = $50,000,000). so, it appears i've 'lost' half the value of my bitcoin. but, again, not really since i don't know how much my bitcoin is worth until i sell it. maybe when i sell it, the price jumps back up to a million a coin or more.

cybercurrency is volatile, meaning the price can swing wildly up or down in very short time spans, so who knows what it's worth until i sell. and, keep in mind, if i start selling a lot at that peak price, i've increased supply, so the price could drop as i'm selling.",1,,Normal_Total,0

&gt;	there is a seperate tax you pay on dividend and related income from capital. if the local dividend tax is 5%, you pay thay country 5% and the netherlands 10%. 

this is a false statement. if the local dividend tax is 5% you pay that country 5% and get a deduction to your box 3 taxes for that amount.  
  
&gt;	if they have 20%, you pay them 20%.

now you pay them 20% and get a deduction of at most 15% to your box 3 taxes.

any dividend taxes paid (up to 15%) as an individual are considered a **voorheffing**, you can deduct them later.  
  
&gt;	if you pay dividend tax abroad, you have to use whatever system they have, which is usually what people refer to as the dividend leak (because i‚Äôm not going to file taxes in ireland to get a few cents back).

ireland levies 0% dividend taxes to non-residents, so that's pretty easy... that's not what people refer to as dividend tax leakage though.  
   
the fund retrieves dividends on your behalf (for example us dividends from the aapl stock in their fund) and will pay withholding taxes to the us based on the tax treaty us &lt;-&gt; ireland  
you as an individual are not able to get a deduction for these paid dividend taxes (inside the fund), now that is what we call dividend tax leakage.

&gt;	however, if you have an accumulating fund, you don‚Äôt actually get any dividend, the fund just becomes bigger. so you don‚Äôt pay taxes on it.

accumulating funds also receive dividends, thus have dividend tax leakage.",8,,huppie,0

volume is not the same as the balance between supply and demand.

&gt;o put it in terms you can understand, if you sell a share of gme from your robinhood account and i buy that share, none of that money goes to gamestop. it doesn‚Äôt have any impact on the operating budget of gamestop. maybe you sold it during a sell off and i bought it at a discount ‚Äî that doesn‚Äôt improve the share price. the only thing that changes their budget is if they sell more shares directly, and that‚Äôs a very rare occurrence.

this is why this is the worst sub, because of people like you whose knowledge of a subject is as shallow as a puddle trying to lecture people who literally trade millions of dollars in options.

apple's share price is extremely relevant to the company. it doesn't matter who i bought my shares from. if enough people do it, it pushes up the stock price - which increases apple employee compensation and reduces their payroll costs.

those are merely the direct effects. the indirect effects are people who own shares and mutual funds and pension funds see their portfolio go up and feel more upbeat about the economy and spend more money. asset price inflation absolutely stimulates the economy.",0,,Fausterion18,0

~~(if someone has access to paid article, please post)~~

  
nvidia corp. is quietly preparing to abandon its purchase of arm ltd. from softbank group corp. after making little to no progress in winning approval for the $40 billion chip deal, according to people familiar with the matter.   
  
nvidia has told partners that it doesn‚Äôt expect the transaction to close, according to one person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. softbank, meanwhile, is stepping up preparations for an arm initial public offering as an alternative to the nvidia takeover, another person said.   
  
  
the purchase -- poised to become the biggest semiconductor deal in history when it was announced in september 2020 -- has drawn a fierce backlash from regulators and the chip industry, including arm‚Äôs own customers. the u.s. federal trade commission sued to stop the transaction in december, arguing that nvidia would become too powerful if it gained control over arm‚Äôs chip designs.   
  
the acquisition also faces resistance in china, where authorities are inclined to block the takeover if it wins approvals elsewhere, according to one person. but they don‚Äôt expect it to get that far.   
  
both nvidia and arm‚Äôs leadership are still pleading their case to regulators, according to the people, and no final decisions have been made. and through it all, the companies have publicly maintained their commitment to the purchase.   
  
‚Äúwe continue to hold the views expressed in detail in our latest regulatory filings -- that this transaction provides an opportunity to accelerate arm and boost competition and innovation,‚Äù nvidia spokesman bob sherbin said.  
  
‚Äúwe remain hopeful that the transaction will be approved,‚Äù a softbank spokesperson said in an emailed statement.   
  
if nvidia manages to get the deal over the line, it would be a massive coup for chief executive officer jensen huang, who has built a graphics-card business into a chipmaking empire. already, he‚Äôs sitting atop the most valuable u.s. company in the semiconductor industry, with a market capitalization of more than half a trillion dollars.   
  
but it will be an uphill fight. qualcomm inc. pulled the plug on its $44 billion takeover of nxp semiconductors nv in 2018 after nearly two years of regulatory hurdles.  
  
the sale of arm is under heavy scrutiny because its chip designs are used in everything from phones to cars to factory equipment, making neutrality the foundation of its business model. the world‚Äôs biggest tech companies rely on arm technology, and they fear they could lose unfettered access under nvidia.   
  
tech giants have lined up against the takeover. a group that includes qualcomm, microsoft corp., intel corp. and amazon.com inc. have provided regulators around the world with what they believe is enough ammunition to kill the deal, according to people familiar with the process. in addition to needing approval in the u.s. and china, the arm purchase needs clearance from the european union and the u.k., both of which are studying the deal closely.  
  
the ordeal has created divisions within nvidia. some people at the company are resigned to the acquisition‚Äôs defeat, but others think management could use the ftc trial to demonstrate the merits of the transaction.  
  
within softbank, there are factions that want to let the process play out -- especially since a gain in nvidia‚Äôs stock price has made the transaction more valuable. even after a recent tumble, nvidia shares have nearly doubled since the arm deal was announced. that‚Äôs added tens of billions of dollars to the initial $40 billion price tag.   
  
others at softbank would prefer to pursue an ipo for arm sooner, while the chip industry is still considered attractive to investors. already, concerns about a slowdown are growing.  
  
the initial agreement between nvidia and softbank expires sept. 13 -- two years after it was forged -- but will automatically renew if approvals take longer. nvidia said at the outset that closing the transaction would take ‚Äúapproximately 18 months.‚Äù that timeline would suggest completion around march of this year -- something that‚Äôs no longer likely.   
  
the ftc lawsuit alone could take months. and the european commission and the u.k.‚Äôs antitrust watchdog will have to weigh in.  
softbank and arm are entitled to keep $2 billion nvidia paid at signing, including a $1.25 billion breakup fee, whether the deal goes through or not.  
nvidia also has to get signoff from chinese authorities at a time when trade tensions are running high. the u.s. has sought to prevent china‚Äôs semiconductor industry from getting access to the latest technology. many of the country‚Äôs fledgling chipmakers are arm customers, giving beijing extra incentive not to let the technology pass into u.s. ownership.    
in arguing against the deal, companies like qualcomm, intel and google have said that nvidia can‚Äôt preserve arm‚Äôs independence because it‚Äôs an arm customer itself. nvidia, the largest maker of graphics chips, competes with intel in server processors and is expanding into new areas that would put it in direct competition with many other arm licensees.  
nvidia also supplies chips to businesses such as amazon‚Äôs aws and microsoft‚Äôs azure, providing technology that handles artificial intelligence processing in data centers. those companies also are developing their own chips, making nvidia both a supplier and a potential rival.",9,,SteelColdKegs,0

1643110037,"no one is disagreeing with you on the narrow definition of a ponzi scheme that you've reiterated here. but it's an old definition forged in a time when the idea of people willingly buying into a ponzi scheme without any fraud or a complex financial scheme that runs as a distributed network of untrusted computer programs were unthinkable.

since then all of this common wisdom has proven to not be necessary -- people buy into ponzi schemes even if they know they are ponzi schemes, and you don't actually need a central con man because everyone who is involved in a ponzi scheme is motivated by self-interest to sell the ponzi scheme along to new participants lest they be left holding the bag.

some people call these kinds of not-quite-ponzi schemes ""bigger fool schemes"" which is a more precise name for what they have become. but the comparison and even label of a ponzi scheme is at least partially accurate. it's a good analogy even if not all the elements are present.

edit: responding to some individual points.

&gt; there is no yield or dividend or profits.

there absolutely is profits. if the value of bitcoin goes up and you can sell it, you've made profits. $aapl pays dividends. $goog does not. both of them are still securities and you can make profits trading either.

&gt; &gt; the scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g., product sales or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.

&gt; everyone knows that buyers of bitcoin are the source of funds, and not some business that bitcoin is doing.

i would dispute wikipedia's language here. it's been speculated that many people who participated in bernie madoff's fund knew it was not legitimate. as many repeated collective pump-and-dump schemes have shown, people are more than willing to buy into things they know will collapse in the hopes of getting out at the right time.

i just don't think fraud and ignorance of the scheme's nature are actually prerequisites to a ponzi scheme.

&gt; there is no con artist, nor business with bitcoin. there is nobody and nothing backing it, by design, intentionally.

there *is* something backing it. namely the distributed consensus of the people operating the network. if there was no such consensus mechanism we wouldn't have things like bitcoin cash and ethereum classic. what there isn't is a single central backer. if you invent something brand new called ""decentralized finance"" and then claim that the term ponzi scheme has no analogies in this new world because ponzi schemes can't be decentralized, that's a bit unfair. people are just trying to fit terms they know like ""bank"" and ""currency"" and ""company"" into a new world where none of these terms are exactly as we know them, and ""ponzi scheme"" is the same way.

&gt; who is ponzi in bitcoin? satoshi? (he ded)

ponzi is everyone involved. you created a technological system embodied in a ledger and a decentralized network of programs that maintain that ledger. the intention was to create a thing with real utility, a currency, but the scaling problems and technical limitations made that more or less infeasible. what was left is a bunch of miners and stakeholders operating bitcoin like a ponzi scheme -- none of them are *the* ponzi, but they all have ponzi's incentives to keep growing bitcoin and finding new investors so they all behave like ponzi out of their own self-interest.",1,,SirClueless,0

1643113152,"you can play with options on cheaper stocks for 2-3$ each. ( 0.02 , 0.03 ) 

at the very minimum, practice with cheap options till you get the ordering down . gl

don‚Äôt be afraid to cancel and replace orders at the same exact price. every dollar counts , don‚Äôt over pay. stay close to the bid, don‚Äôt pay the ask‚Ä¶ please and thank you

i recommend buying one long call option for as cheap as you can. after you get one , sell a higher strike for the same price or better . this is a debit spread. keep trying to make debit spreads , it‚Äôs good if you can profit 1 dollar.

a brief example : 

call 10 strike - pay 0.02. ,
‚Ä¶not getting filled.. 
replace order, bid 0.02 again 
( hopefully the bid is 0.01 before you are bidding 0,02.. there‚Äôs no point in bidding the same price as someone else)
success, you‚Äôve been filled at 0.02! 

 hopefully before hand , you‚Äôve scouted the strikes above 10 , and someone else is bidding 0.01 on strikes 10.5,11, etc. 

hopefully, you have level 3 option. 

after opening a long position with 1x option  , this is where you  open a short position above the strike of your long position. 

you can continue opening these same positions and it does not constitute day trade. 

simply , a day trade is when you open and close the same position on the same day you ordered it. 

you can open the same long+short positions as much as you‚Äôd like. 

hopefully you have spotted before committing to anything, a cluster of cheaply priced options. the more time and closer to the price of stock is more valuable. 

that way , you can be more confident that you are not going to lose money. your 90% sure that at the very least , you‚Äôll break even. this is accomplished by looking at the ‚Äò bid - ask ‚Äò spread. don‚Äôt think too hard. ignore the greeks. simply study the price spread. 

that being said , look for the 0.01 ~ 0.05
priced options. you want to open debit spreads , one leg at a time . this means , order each position separately. you can profit this way. otherwise you must pay a premium to order a debit spread with both legs in the same order. that means buying two seperate strikes at the same time in one order , usually buy + sell. don‚Äôt do it that way.. because you can profit a few dollars by ordering separately at very precise prices that you determine beforehand. 

[ specifically, i‚Äôd like to point out here , do 1 quantity of option per order, it makes getting filled much more likely , then say , 100 options ]

this is where you switch to sell, after buying 1. 
sell the strikes above the one you just bought.. otherwise it‚Äôs a credit spread. 

it cost more to lay down the collateral on a credit spread , unless you have a debit spread , 
it‚Äôs possible the debit spread can cover the collateral. (nice trick;)

essentially, you can start with 5$ and make 100$  in a few hours if you are skilled. simply by profiting 1$ a lot of times.

aura cannabis [acb] , is a pretty good stock with cheaply priced options. somewhat a volatile stock , you can get orders filled at generous prices! 

this stock has weekly options. stocks with weekly options are pretty good because there‚Äôs more options to choose explore. 

good luck hunting option #arbritage

these are the kind of things i wish i knew before trading , maybe  you can understand a little bit!

i‚Äôve turned 5$ to 30k this way , cashing out profit every single day and leaving at most 100$ for the next day‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt like leaving too much in my account! you can cash in / out instantly whenever you want using cashapp + robinhood cash card. 

give it a try , it‚Äôs a lot of fun. i never stress about losing money, because honestly, i don‚Äôt even really invest. i always profit , assuming i stick to the strategy i explained above üëÜ‚Ä¶ i won‚Äôt lie and say i haven‚Äôt lost a lot of money yoloing spy calls. that‚Äôs why i don‚Äôt leave money in my account, lul.

if you invest normally, keep in mind that robinhood is selling your data , and they use that data against you in order to profit. imagine a car dealer ship that knows your position, the price you payed , the price you want , everything, and in order to profit , they use that information against you, nefariously. 

if you invest normally, just buy and hold apple stock. it has like 10 billion shares with a lot of liquidity. warren buffett has a nice stake in it. no one will be dumping on you. it‚Äôs difficult to short 4 billion apple shares. apple pay‚Äôs dividends, shorts don‚Äôt want to pay that dividend. shorts cannot compete too much against this kind of a stock.",1,,Any-coat-1321,0

- three, the local tech market has slowly but surely been growing and diversifying. instead of just microsoft and amazon, you have facebook, google, apple, redfin, zillow, tiktok and more that are slowly (or quickly) growing their presence here. employees at those companies may also have had a lot of stock compensation, or a big sign-on bonus, or they are moving from silicon valley and have a huge chunk of equity from selling their house in an even crazier housing market.",43,,ubelmann,0

just keep investing, even if there is a recession (i am not saying there will be) as long as you keep your job and keep investing you will do great

lehman brothers was a 160yo company, highly respected within its industry.  in 2005, 2006, and 2007, they posted record earnings because they were one of a handful of companies known to understand the stock markets better than anyone else.

if anyone understood the stock market, one would think it was the employees of lehman.

if anyone understood a company's moat and had reason to know their company would grow and be successful, it should have been the employees of a company that understood the stock market as well as anyone could expect the stock market could ever be understood.

in 2008, lehman laid off 25,000 employees and went bankrupt, closing it's doors forever.

1643144443,"overall sounds like a solid financial picture, in a vacuum. if it's a traditional 401k (not roth 401k) then you are reaping tax benefits immediately because the t401k contributions lower your taxable income. opening an ira might be attractive to you, for one, you can invest in all equities offered by the broker (e.g., open a roth ira and put in as much as you can up to the yearly max, and you can invest all in say $aapl or whatever else). whereas in a 401k you are more likely limited to a list of funds including mutual funds, whatever is offered by your plan administrator. 

with the ira, can go either traditional or roth. if you're single with that salary, a tira contribution is no longer tax-deductible so tira is effectively useless, so roth ira would be the way to go. based on your magi i believe you are good to contribute up to the yearly max - and the tax benefit of the roth is deferred, you enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

in sum, to each their own. but a reasonable strategy could be t401k, and roth ira. strike balance. also keeping cash on hand for life purposes, emergencies, spending etc., and also if/when student loan repayments start again. gl",2,,222KFT,0

microsoft‚Äôs earnings weren‚Äôt bad. it reported earnings of $2.48 a share, beating forecasts for $2.31, on sales of $51.7 billion, topping estimates for $50.9. azure revenue growth grew by 46%, according to wedbush analyst dan ives, beating street expectations for 45% growth, but unfortunately lower than ‚Äúsome bullish whisper numbers at 48%.‚Äù and with that, microsoft stock (ticker: msft) has fallen 5.2% at 5:18 p.m. in after-hours trading.

that‚Äôs not just a problem for owners of microsoft stock. it‚Äôs also the second-largest publicly traded company in the u.s., which means it‚Äôs the second-largest holding in the s&amp;p 500 and the nasdaq-100. and that means those indexes are already falling, even though the market isn‚Äôt even open right now. the spdr s&amp;p 500 etf (spy), which tracks the s&amp;p 500 and has a 6% position in microsoft, has fallen 1% in after-hours trading, while the invesco qqq (qqq), which tracks the nasdaq-100 and has a 9.9% stake in microsoft, has fallen 1.6%.

that may change by morning. investors might have a change of heart, and microsoft‚Äôs earnings, which looked pretty good, might turn out to have been good enough. ives is optimistic. ‚Äúwe would be buyers on this modest sell off as we believe the underlying metrics and implied growth trajectory into the rest of 2022 is strong for msft,‚Äù he writes.

microsoft ‚Äòs earnings weren‚Äôt enough to arrest the market‚Äôs decline. its a conference, call, however, was another story.

if anything was going to arrest the stock market‚Äôs decline before wednesday‚Äôs federal reserve announcement, it was going to be microsoft earnings. and they weren‚Äôt bad. microsoft reported earnings of $2.48 a share, beating forecasts for $2.31, on sales of $51.7 billion, topping estimates for $50.9. azure revenue growth grew by 46%, according to wedbush analyst dan ives, beating street expectations for 45% growth, but unfortunately lower than ‚Äúsome bullish whisper numbers at 48%.‚Äù and with that, microsoft stock (ticker: msft) had fallen 5.2% at 5:18 p.m. in after-hours trading.

that wasn‚Äôt just a problem for owners of microsoft stock. it‚Äôs also the second-largest publicly traded company in the u.s., which means it‚Äôs the second-largest holding in the s&amp;p 500 and the nasdaq-100. and that means those indexes are already falling, even though the market isn‚Äôt even open right now. the spdr s&amp;p 500 etf (spy), which tracks the s&amp;p 500 and has a 6% position in microsoft, had fallen 1% in after-hours trading, while the invesco qqq (qqq), which tracks the nasdaq-100 and has a 9.9% stake in microsoft, had dropped 1.6%.

that all changed after microsoft‚Äôs conference call, which caused investors to have a change of heart. and why wouldn‚Äôt they? microsoft said its third-quarter productivity and business processes revenue would come in between $15.6 billion and $15.85 billion, and its personal computing revenue would come in between $14.15 billion and $14.45 billion. it also said its margins would grow slightly. and with that, microsoft‚Äôs loss became a gain‚Äîas did the stock market‚Äôs.

with microsoft up 2.3% at 6:50 p.m., the qqq etf has risen 0.6% and the spdr s&amp;p 500 etf had advanced 0.3%.

now the fed just has to keep from messing it all up.

    private static final bigdecimal upper = bigdecimal.valueof(20);

    private static int getscore(bigdecimal sales) {

it also took me a long time to realize p/e is not a good stock valuation as it is measuring past success when stocks are priced based on future earnings.  that's why forward p/e is much much better stock valuation and why tech stocks have a much higher valuation than coca-cola or walgreens.  the problem i have with tech is it was so overvalued after the start of the market freaking out over the virus that it got to dot com nosebleed levels.  that also means there maybe some very good buying opportunities now.  but it also means $aapl, $amzn, and $tsla have the potential for a market correction like $nflx after earnings.",0,,drew-gen-x,0

&gt;just because the failure of softbank group corp.‚Äôs sale of arm ltd. to nvidia corp. seemed inevitable, it doesn‚Äôt mean the scuttled deal is any less painful.  
&gt;  
&gt;executives at nvidia, the most valuable u.s. chip company, have started telling people that it doesn‚Äôt expect to close the $40 billion purchase announced in sept. 2020, bloomberg news reported tuesday. softbank, which was betting on a windfall, is meanwhile starting to pave the way for listing the british semiconductor designer, according to the report.  
&gt;  
&gt;investors ought not be surprised. regulators across the globe have sneered at the merger of nvidia ‚Äî a huge and growing designer of chips used in graphics cards, servers and electric vehicles ‚Äî with arm, the cambridge-based architect of semiconductors used in almost every facet of the world economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;their skepticism centers on the quite-reasonable notion that an nvidia-arm merger would create a virtually-unstoppable powerhouse in an industry that has already gained international attention due to chip shortages. arm designs the very core of processors made by apple inc., qualcomm inc. and samsung electronics co., and for years its executives used that ubiquity as a poison-pill argument against getting taken over by any of its clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;yet both nvidia and softbank kept clinging to the belief that they could push this deal through.  
&gt;  
&gt;unknown a decade ago, nvidia found a lucrative niche in its earliest days by entering the market for chips that process graphics in computers. from there it started selling to games consoles, before pivoting to even thirstier computing tasks such as artificial intelligence. the recent demand for ai and electric vehicles has boosted both sales and its market value.  
&gt;  
&gt;that‚Äôs been a boon for softbank, too, because more than half the proceeds of its sale of arm were to come in nvidia stock. at $584 billion, nvidia is now worth 92% more than when the deal was made. the share portion of the sale alone is valued at over $40 billion, plus as much as $17 billion in cash that was to go with it.  
&gt;  
&gt;softbank really needs that money, and it won‚Äôt get nearly as much from an ipo. after taking arm private for $31 billion in 2016, the japanese conglomerate currently values the company at $24 billion. but with revenue of $2.5 billion per year, such a price tag still looks rich. while nvidia itself trades at 24-times sales, it manages to attract such valuations because it‚Äôs on track to hit revenue growth of 60% for this fiscal year. qualcomm, another possible comparison, is valued at around 5.7-times sales and the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index averages closer to 7-times.  
&gt;  
&gt;whatever figure ipo investors settle on, softbank is going to miss out on the big cash prize it was hoping for, because not only will it get so much less, it also won‚Äôt be able to offload the entire company onto public markets. at best, it‚Äôll be able to borrow money using its arm holdings as collateral ‚Äî a tactic it has often deployed with its large stake in alibaba group holding ltd.  
&gt;  
&gt;and it needs that cash because the balance sheet is looking quite burdened. at the end of september its current ratio ‚Äî which measures current assets divided by current liabilities ‚Äî had fallen to just 0.78, implying that more money is due in the coming year than it has available.  
&gt;  
&gt;a handful of winners for its vision fund have helped fill the coffers, yet it‚Äôs also had some notable failures, including troubled rental startup the we co. (better known as wework). not only did that debacle hurt the bottom line, it damaged softbank chairman masayoshi son‚Äôs reputation as a master dealmaker. pulling off the arm sale, with a lucrative bag of nvidia shares, was supposed to be the transaction that proved he‚Äôs still got the magic touch.  
&gt;  
&gt;but now investors have reason to fear the magic is gone, and they may be left wondering where the cash will come from to pay its debts.

arm is, for people who don't realize it, a company which doesn't really make much of anything from licensing the architecture that powers over 200 billion devices on the earth and which is critical to modern infrastructure from the phone in your hand to the servers that power the internet. they aren't a profitable ongoing concern and being a publicly traded company requires consistently turning profits.

the best ultimate outcome for arm would be acquisition by another company. unfortunately any other tech company that tries to acquire arm will run into the same antitrust concerns nvidia did. any chinese company that tries to acquire arm will be rejected out of hand by western regulators in the us and eu who would absolutely not allow such critical technology to fall into china's hands.

so arm is in a very bad situation here. they cannot likely survive as an independent company. no one can be allowed to acquire them, because anyone who wants them would be slated immediately by regulators the way nvidia was. softbank is not in a financial position to continue ownership of them and will divest by any means necessary, up to and including spinoff and listing for public trading.

none of this is good, and letting nvidia acquire arm would have been the least bad of the many bad options. nvidia would have kept arm in the west and out of china's hands. nvidia has the resources and the engineering talent to continue development of arm architecture. most importantly, nvidia is a big and profitable tech company which could have financially supported arm as a division of their company.

now, the fate of arm is seriously in doubt. what happens next is anyone's guess.",45,,unknown_soldier_,0

1643193074,"&gt;years the crypto bros have been swearing up and down it will replace the usd, and while no one ever took them seriously, **this is the first time i‚Äôve seen a really concise explanation of how that‚Äôs impossible.**

i actually didn't get into why it's impossible yet, but i can.

suppose i purchase a $500 ps5 from overstock using bitcoin.  if the price of bitcoin drops by half in a month, i come out ahead.  if the price of bitcoin doubles, i ask for a refund.  i get to pocket all the gains, while someone else swallows the losses.  this is obviously a very bad deal for overstock.

you can apply the same principle to any other speculative asset.  i.e., suppose you use apple stock to pay for an iphone.  if the price of stock goes up, you ask for a refund to get you're stock back.  this is why it's incredibly stupid to treat a speculative asset as a currency.

bitcoin enthusiasts don't see this as a problem.  in fact, they use the lack of charge backs as a major selling point.

a big part of the problem is that crypto bros tend to be extremely priviledged people with no concept of hardship.  they assume that everything is supposed to work perfectly on day one, and then you're supposed to immortalize that perfection so that nothing ever changes.  that's the entire point of having a permanent block chain.  if someone buys something at a retailer, then the assumption is that there shouldn't be any reason for the customer to ask for a refund.

in the real world, screw ups happen all the damn time, requiring constant correction.",35,,LRonPaul2012,0

**the status of the stock market is a terrible indicator of the economy.** at best, it indicates how rich people are doing. stocks are speculation and often create feedback loops and self-fulfilling prophecies. if traders think a crash is coming, they will sell, and if enough people sell, they create the crash they believed was coming. this also works the other way. if enough traders think a rally is coming, they'll buy and create the rally. none of those events in any way indicate how good the economy is.

1643231683,"the difference is that stocks have intrinsic value in the earnings of the underlying company. a simplified way of looking at it is price = instrinsic value + speculative value. speculative value is a premium on top on instrinsic value that people pay because they either think that the earnings of the company will grow or they think someone will pay more for it.

with stocks, the intrinsic value can be approximated via earnings reports and we can use pe ratio to estimate how much of the price is speculative.  the massively important thing is there is an absolute price floor beyond which buying the stock is nearly guaranteed profit as long as the company stays in business. that is, apple stock has intrinsic value because people give apple money for iphones and shareholders are entitled to some cut of that money; if the price dropped below the cut of that money, then buying stock is instant almost guaranteed profit, so demand would rise to bring them back into equilibrium.

with crypto, the intrinsic value isn't really well understood and may be very close to zero. (it could also be $1 million per coin if you listen to a bitcoin maxi, but i don't think that view is realistic.) there is no underlying revenue to form a price floor, so it's possible that the price is almost entirely speculative value.",4,,meekmarmot,0

&gt; some examples of the rules that you have like the example with the text editor?

i have a script that uses rofi to prompt me for the unlock password for an encrypted usb storage device that holds the key for my keepass:

    bindsym $meta+k exec $home/.local/bin/padlock &lt;uuid of usb stick&gt;

and lock it again before locking the screen when i hit meta+l

    bindsym $meta+l exec $home/.local/bin/padlock &lt;uuid of usb stick&gt; lock; exec light-locker-command -l

and if you want to open your launcher with just a single press of the meta key, you have to capture it with bind*code* instead:

    bindcode 133 --release exec --no-startup-id ""rofi -no-lazy-grab -show drun -modi run,window,ssh,drun""

my best one though is probably the shortcut to see the currently defined hotkeys:

    bindsym $meta+f1 exec terminal=alacritty i3-sensible-terminal -e $home/.local/bin/i3-keybinds.sh &amp;

the i3-keybinds.sh script is (and this is probably a bit sloppy, but gets the job done for now)

    #!/bin/bash
    /usr/bin/grep -e ""bindsym"" -e ""bindcode"" $home/.config/i3/config | /usr/bin/grep -v -e ""^#"" -e ""^ "" | /usr/bin/cut -d"" "" -f 2- | sed 's/\$mod/meta/g' | less

&gt; some windows tiling and some windows floating?

yup!

&gt; how does i3 handle windows that are designed to be floating but are being tiled?

depends on the window. until/unless you've told that window to float, it will be stretched out across a workspace container, just like any other window. usually this just means a lot of empty space between elements. like a sentence of text, with two buttons way at the bottom of the screen. you can always tell a window to float on command with a hotkey (pretty sure meta+shift+space is the default)

here are some examples from my config of windows that i decided needed to be floating at all times. because i defined these in the config file, they never get tiled at all, and are floating immediately when opened.

virtual machine manager

    for_window [title=""virtual machine manager""] floating enable
    for_window [title=""virtual machine manager""] border pixel 1
    for_window [title=""virtual machine manager""] resize set 600 950

    for_window [title=""remmina remote desktop client""] floating enable
    for_window [title=""remmina remote desktop client""] border pixel 3
    for_window [title=""remmina remote desktop client""] resize set 745 700
    for_window [title=""remmina remote desktop client""] move position center

steam

    for_window [title=""steam - news*""] floating enable
    for_window [title=""steam - news*""] border normal 3
    for_window [title=""steam - news*""] resize set 635 840
    for_window [title=""steam - news*""] move position center
    
    for_window [title=""steam - self updater""] floating enable
    for_window [title=""steam - self updater""] move position 300 300

and i saved this one for last

&gt; recommend for programs like a terminal emulator?

i'm one of those weirdos that uses a dropdown terminal, specifically tilda. if i want to tile terminals, i'll use tmux, i don't need terminal windows tiled all over my desktop. instead, i prefer that all of my terminals be in a single tabbed window that is a single button-press away.",3,,shamanonymous,0

95% of jeff bezos' money is in amazon stock. it's never moved. it's literally never done anything.  


the vast majority if bill gate's money is in berkshire hathaway stock. so it once moved from microsoft stock to berkshire. this happened over decades of time when he sold his microsoft stock and bough berkshire.  


that money didn't go into the economy. it didn't get invested in people. it didn't buy goods. it didn't create any new economic value because it just sat there.  


the only person you can debate is contributing some economic value is musk who occasionally pulls out money to reinvest in spacex which as employees and is funded through a lot of his money. except that money is often just him leveraging his shares of tesla to fund spacex.  


billionaires do not move money. but the 95% of americans who actually have jobs move money every single day. we are the reason the economy exists. we are the ones buying musk's cars, and shopping on amazon and if we stopped their wealth would go to 0.  


butting money in the stock market is not moving money. if you were directly investing in a company that employs people who are paid through the money you invested that's another thing entirely, again see space x. but that's not how trading stocks work. if i buy 10 shares of amazon today that money doesn't go to amazon to pay their workers. it goes to another person who had 10 shares of amazon and sold them at the price i bought them for. if amazon had another public offering that would be another story, but that is unlikely to ever happen because they don't need money.  


also for reference microsoft just paid $68.7 billion in cash to buy activison blizzard. large companies are insanely rich right now and the #1 thing they could do to improve america is give all of their employees a raise. every company should. and those that aren't are hemorrhaging employees because others are finally offering better wages. that money isn't going to the employees of activision/blizzard, unless they owned shares in the company. it's just so that microsoft can now put them on their balance sheet and have more dominance in video games. it will almost guaranteed lead to layoffs in the coming future and fewer jobs.

[thanks for the detailed input!  this was an exercise to examine one very specific (albeit significant) aspect of aapl. i've done my own independent deep dive and definitely see a lot of strong points in the company. however, overall i believe the bad outweighs the good in the short-term.  it's rather obvious that revenue is not an appropriate metric to measure the a company's profitability, but maybe that had to be stated in my original piece. revenue was used because this piece is about consumer spending on apple products which can really only be measured by looking at revenue.  agree that services are seeing strong growth and increasing profit margins which is a very promising thing to see. this is why long-term i am bullish on aapl. however, the growth in services will not offset the decline in consumer spending that i am expecting to see in the short-term.](/r/stocks/comments/scz42n/bad_apple_why_aapl_is_heavily_overvalued/huapolz/)

learn vi (and regular expressions).

yes, not as quick and easy to learn as, e.g. pico, but once fairly well learned, much faster and more efficient to use - an in the long-term, on \*nix, one will generally spend much more time using editor, than learning it.  and you needn't learn all the goop that vim includes (it adds lots of non-posix goop, including even [annoying](https://www.mpaoli.net/~michael/linux/vim/vim_annoyances.txt) stuff ... but whatever, some folks like vim a lot).  see also:

anyway, bre or ere, quite simple to do.  per your ""specification, looks like you've got columns 1-20 for names 21-40 for ""namephone"" - i'm presuming the phone number associated to the name in the first field in the same line.  so, all we need do is extract those and put some separator between them, e.g. if we want to separate with, let's say |, we could do something like:  
sed -ne 's/\^\\(.\\{20\\}\\)\\(.\\{20\\|\\).\*$/\\1|\\2/p'  
provide the input as stdin or file argument (after the sed script), and the output goes to stdout, which one can redirect to some other file.  gnu sed also offers an ""edit in place"" capability with it's -i option - but read the relevant details in the documentation - as it doesn't literally edit the file in place, but actually replaces it - that can make a difference in some cases, and each method has it's advantages and disadvantages.  
one could also use ed or ex (ex is same program as vi, just in ex mode).  
either of those could do quite similar, and with tiny bit of shell could do it as cli edit-in-place:  
1,$v/\^.\\{40\\}/d  
1,$s/\^\\(.\\{20\\}\\)\\(.\\{20\\|\\).\*$/\\1|\\2/  
w  
q

that would work with either ed or ex (or vi or vim in ex mode), though in those later non-ed cases, we could make it a bit simpler and shorter, notably changing 1,$ to % and  
w  
q  
to simply:  
wq

anyway, those edit bits - the first would delete lines that have less than 40 characters - our sed example does similar but omits them from the output by not matching for the s command, and with the -n option, then not outputting them since there wasn't a match - but if there was a match, substitution would've been done, and with the p option on the s command, output the result after the substitution.  and our s command between sed and the rest is quite similar.  just with sed we default to all lines, and ed/ex we specify all lines (otherwise they'd just default to the current line, whereas sed by default is handling all lines), and in the case of sed we have the p option used, as explained.  with ed/ex we just write the end results to our file then quit.

anyway, you could change what character(s) you use to separate the fields.  if you wanted/needed to get snazzier, could also strip whitespace where present from the start and end of the fields - but then your fields would no longer be fixed width - but at least you'd still know their maximum possible width.

and if we used ere rather than bre, that would slightly change our re syntax (notably when we'd include or leave out leading \\) - otherwise quite the same for this.

and ... some have suggested awk ... could you do it with awk?  it would be much easier with awk if you had some field separator character - and especially if also the fields were of variable width - but that not being the case, probably much easier to do with sed/ed/ex/vi as one may wish/prefer.",1,,michaelpaoli,0

1643291742,"this thread seems like a good place to bring this up: i have been burrowing into [wifeyalpha](https://twitter.com/wifeyalpha) on twitter, for as near as i can tell they do not have a reddit presence. the account is relatively new, and very bearish on current market conditions and how the fed has been reacting since nov 2021.

i get the impression they use machine learning to discover market movements and pivots; looking at their history shows they predicted monday and tuesday's volatility to a tee on the previous friday. probably based in the uk. [chiefquant](https://twitter.com/chiefquant) is maybe their husband? i dunno, but i've had to explain to mrs. mcgoo why i'm constantly scrolling through a twitter thread with a smoking hot red bikini profile pic

they tweet a lot. there's a shit ton of stuff to sift through, and i swear i can't scroll past 1/24 on their timeline with all the retweets, memes, and whatnot. what has stuck with me most is they call out when to enter and exit intra-day futures trading; when they say to close positions, not 15 minutes later spy is on its way up. it's also difficult to sift through their euphemisms, so i will save you some time on the two key ones:

[they have a 'bunny' portfolio, which consists of 'intras'](https://twitter.com/wifeyalpha/status/1486023314422259716) which are short-term put positions on futures... /es /nq and /rty that i have seen recently. i don't trade futures so this is above my head, but can be played similarly with spxu or sqqq, maybe tza?

i treat their clues and commentary similar to the croissant, to be interpreted as you will. but their timing is eerie. and they claim to be helping retail for free because of [shamanic ayni](https://www.shamanicsoulcenter.com/blog1/2019/6/10/a-key-insight-from-my-recent-journey-to-peru) so that's nice. for me, it's another data point for the macro conditions and i thought mjr would find them the same

options are contracts which right but not obligation to buy or sell an asset at a certain price before a certain date. 

an option to buy at a certain price is a car option and the option to sell a certain price is called out option.

you can think of them as ways to bet on a price of a stock to go up or down. let's say you buy an august 31 2022 $120 apple call option. this means you're buying the right to buy an apple stock for $120 bucks anytime from now to august 31, 2022, you don't have to buy it, you can let is expire. if you think the price of apple will be above $120 then you're getting a good deal buying that option contract. 

futures are contracts. you agree to buy or sell a certain amount of something on a date in the future at a price you agree to now.

for example i come up to you and say i sell you a used car on christmas if you give me $2000 right now and you think ""that's a good price"" and you give me the $2k.

**daily:**

* $amd macht -5% und f√§llt auf 74‚Ç¨. $aapl gibt nach close die q4-zahlen raus. same shit, different year. u/cocotheape ""*amd ist immer riskant nach events/earnings. heute ist aber insgesamt bisher ein schwieriger tag. nur apple h√§lt sich unbeschadet wegen der earnings heute abend.*""
* der n√§chste maimai-stock tritt auf die b√ºhne. die insolvente kinokette $amc - oder das ""gamestop f√ºr arme"" (u/lmaaaaokys) macht √ºber 300% und ballert von $5 auf $20. volumen: 1,25 millarden. u/ohvalox macht vor seiner makro√∂konimik-pr√ºfung 172% rendite.
* auch f√ºr die korsarengang ist es ein guter tag: +6,66% und $41 stehen am ende im portfolio. zwischenzeitlich waren es sogar +23%. $crsr
* u/ifaqyurmama: ""*hab das gef√ºhl es wird hier eher ruhig...*"" und das wurde es auch, denn heute wurde der quetsch teilweise gequetscht. 

**gamestop-sammelfaden #1**:

* nun. $gme er√∂ffnet bei 180‚Ç¨, f√§llt auf 150‚Ç¨ und ballert auf 283,65‚Ç¨ bei close, w√§hrend es zwischendurch die 300‚Ç¨-marke durchbricht. es stehen +139,53% zubuche. der h√∂chste wert, den gamestop jemals bei close erreichen sollte, allerdings noch nicht das ath, welches einen tag sp√§ter bei 420‚Ç¨ (tradegate) erreicht wird.
* u/flobobobo l√∂st sein krypto-portfolio f√ºr gamestop auf, da im dieses nicht volatil genug ist.
* u/error_iuris: ""*ich werde den aktienmarkt nie wieder ernstnehmen k√∂nnen. kursschwankungen von +-100 innerhalb weniger minuten: gebe keinen fick mehr. es wird gehalten, beim dip irgendeine zahl vom verrechnungskonto auf gme geballert und gut ist. habe ich das spiel durchgespielt?*""
* u/ribak145 ""*gme ruiniert den aktienmarkt f√ºr alle frischlinge wie das erste mal mit einem pornostar. so etwas werden wir die n√§chsten 10 jahre nicht mehr sehen üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ*""
* ein vertreter von melvin capital erkl√§rt fr√ºh am handelstag live bei cnbc, dass sie die shorts bereits gecovert h√§tten. die si-daten von s3, die am morgen herauskamen, behaupten anderes. [es besteht immer noch ein short interest von knapp 140%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l642ms/updated_jan_27th_short_interest_data_posted_by_s3/)
* u/ifaqyurmama: ""*l√∂scht eure sell orders, stop und limit
oder lasst es, hallo bafin wir reden √ºber mongolische korbweberei*""
* auch r/finanzen er√∂ffnet einen gamestop-thread. 16 kommentare nach 56 minuten - gr√∂√ütenteils ablehnend.
* u/notready4lyfe ""*wir sehen uns in der tagesschau heute abend*""
* die berichterstattung wandelt sich immer mehr hin zu: ""internetkinder ruinieren die b√∂rse!"" ""illegale marktmanipulationen!"" wenige worte zur short-situation.

**gamestop-sammelfaden #2**:

* u/zager83 ""*ich feier ja irgendwie, dass sie uns immer als internet-kids o.√§. betiteln. wtf ich bin 38 hahahaah, thx bro*""
* u/ruedaparahamster ""*in der b√∂rse vor 8 auf der ard haben sie uns einfach ‚Äûjugendliche zocker mit wenig bis keiner b√∂rsenerfahrung‚Äú genannt üòÇüòÇ*"" hallo msw, das sind wir!üëã
* u/lulzkrizzle: ""*mich st√∂rt dieses ""verabreden"" von dem die ganzen medien immer alle reden. ich verabrede mich hier zu gar nichts, ich schau ab und an mal rein und poste hier meinen d√ºnnpfiff.*""
* in den sp√§teren handelsstunden wird gamestop etwas weniger volatil. auch u/ztirom3101 wundert sich √ºber keine 100% in der letzten stunde und geht davon aus, nie wieder normal handeln zu k√∂nnen.
* u/threedollarpillow freut sich auf 34ct dividende im m√§rz.
* r/wallstreetbets geht mehrmals auf privat. grund hierf√ºr waren attacken von bots, die sich auch auf msw verirrt haben. zeitgleich dazu fallen die kurse, werden aber in minutenschnelle wieder hochgekauft. u/stlnkstiefel nennt es ""*das letzte aufb√§umen vor dem tod*""
* * der erste sammelfaden musste wegen zu vielen kommentaren dicht gemacht werden. es waren 10797 kommentare. viele kommentare sind gel√∂scht, wohl von bots. auch die geflohenen amis verirren sich wieder in unser beschauliches sub.
* u/crown37 mit der zusammenfassung des tages: ""*k√∂nnen wir kurz nochmal auf den verr√ºckten tag zur√ºckblicken? die shorts sind inzwischen so verzweifelt geworden, dass sie √ºber cnbc(!) fake schlagzeilen verbreiten und reddit mit einer unglaublichen flut an bots √ºberschwemmen. das h√§tte sich letzte woche niemand auch nur ann√§hrend vorstellen k√∂nnen.
und trotzdem sind wir heute bei 120% im plus.
ich liebe euch.*""
* oliver baron schreibt: ""*die internet-meute hat gelernt, auf der klaviatur der finanzm√§rkte besser zu spielen als so mancher profi.*""
* u/darkzonk appelliert an die diamantenh√§nde und auf den fokus auf gamestop im gewirr der meme-aktien: 
""*es iust wichtig, dass wir alle gemeinsam eine aktie ballern,. ich habe auch amc+bb verkauft und bin in gme gegangen.*""
* u/yolidiot: ""*deepfuckinvalue ist weiterhin in, freunde. zahlreiche ranghohe us-politiker sprechen sich f√ºr uns aus, es hat sich nichts ver√§ndert.*""

sell a $25 put for 1/19/24, which would give me roughly $2,200 in credit. i then put that $2,200 into something relatively safe like $spy, $msft, $nvda, etc. once i get maybe 10% roi, i buy back the put, buy mvis with the gains, rinse and repeat.

assume for stock (n) with weight (w) with an increase of x there is a combination of stocks c(ni)*(wi) where i is any other stock in the subset of 500 with an opposite gain/loss of market value.

therefore sum(nwj - c(ni)*(wi)j) should be 0. except more and more people join the stock market or more money is added to the stock marker, therefore 0% gain + x% entrance of any or all of 500 stocks will yield a gain every day while any or all of the stocks have a positive outlook.

the phenomenon we see here is a big fluctuation in a single stock with a weight of 6.7% which cannot be cancelled out by any combination of other stocks going the opposite way.

therefore the remainder will be applied to the aggregated:

1643335433,"edit: i‚Äôm done responding because the incessant downvoting is actually getting exhausting. taking time out of my night with my family to explain what nfts are to people who clearly don‚Äôt actually want to know what nfts are is a very frustrating experience. i tried to help you, maybe i did help someone, but the vast majority still don‚Äôt understand and i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ you just want to remain in this bubble where you can insult the thing you don‚Äôt get and insult the people who do get it. confirmation bias works both ways.

basically, when we describe something as fungible, what we mean is that you can readily replace it with something equivalent and that's fine for everyone concerned. take a dollar bill, for example. we say it's fungible because if someone rips up a dollar bill in your wallet, they can replace it with another dollar bill and you're no worse or better off: both of those dollar bills spend the same. similarly, one share of apple stock is worth the same as any other share of apple stock. it doesn't really matter which one you have, because from the perspective of being able to get value from it, number 304 is the same as number 3,539. one 1kg lump of pure gold is functionally the same as another 1kg lump of pure gold, if you're using it as a store of value. they're designed to be equivalent and interchangeable. (keep in mind that this isn't just about the value of the item. one share of company a might be priced the same as one share of company b, but you can't just swap those shares even if they're technically worth the same. to be fungible, the two items have to be functionally identical.)

however, now imagine the lucky dollar bill you have that you saved from your first paycheck -- the one you believe brings you good luck, scrooge mcduck style. if someone rips up that bill, then replacing it with another dollar just isn't going to cut it. it's no longer a fungible item.

so now imagine something like a book. you can have a fungible copy of a book (any mass-market paperback is pretty much interchangeable with any other, after all; if all you're buying is the text, you're fine). however, you can also have non-fungible copies of a book -- like, for example, a first edition with a limited cover and a signed bookplate from the author. once those are all sold, you're out of luck if you want to get one. they're just not making any more. this has been a big selling point for physical media for decades, with collectors -- and people willing to pay a premium -- paying more to get that unique extra, even if they're not technically getting more out of it. (it's not like buying a special edition of a dvd with extra commentaries and special features, for example.) this is the reason why an original picasso costs so much more than even the most skilled reproduction. you're not just paying for the look of the painting, but for its history and provenance. you're paying for the fact that it's a picasso.

but how does that work with the shift towards electronic media, such as digital art and ebooks? after all, the whole point of digital media is that (in theory at least) it's infinitely reproducible. my copy of an ebook is quite literally an identical copy of your copy, right down to the same ones and zeroes. you can't really have a collector's edition of an ebook, right? how do you have something special, given the technology that allows you to create an exact copy in the time it takes you to press ctrl+v?

this is where blockchain comes in. remember how, with cryptocurrency like bitcoin and ethereum, the whole point is that you can use what's basically a giant list to keep track of where the money is, and who owns what? you can use that same technology to ensure that you own a 'limited edition' version of a creative work that, because it's digital, would otherwise be infinitely reproducible. just like the person with the limited-run edition of their favourite novel on their bookshelf, or an original painting by their favourite artist, you have a token that says (effectively) 'i bought one of only 200 limited edition versions of this piece, and no matter how many times the piece itself is copied, there will only ever be 200 of these tokens. as a result, it is special.'

for some people, it's for bragging rights. for some people, it's to support their favourite creators by buying a 'premium' version that's unique to them (or certainly more unique). for other people, it's an investment; as with any good where only a limited number exist, they may expect it to increase in value over time, so it can be sold on.

in short, it's a way of applying some of the limited edition value of physical objects to the digital marketplace by creating an artificial scarcity.",-29,,hey_im_cool,0

1643379379,"the thing most of ‚Äúus‚Äù know is that if you compare tesla to any other tech company during their growth phases the company is ridiculously undervalued.  the conclusion i‚Äôve reached is that it is simply due to the lack of mystery around elon.  

think about it.  apple and amazon both disrupted boring, low pe legacy businesses.  cell phones and big box retailers.  but people constantly give them credit for or believe that their next big product is right around the corner.  for how many years has apple moved on rumors of ar/vr headsets or the apple car?  amazon buys a crappy grocery store franchise and it collapses the whole grocery store stock market because amazon is going to make grocers obsolete by some as-yet unknown product.  yet tesla‚Äôs flagship development (fsd) is being unveiled right before our eyes and does not move the price at all.

the problem with tesla valuation really just comes down to elon.  he‚Äôs re-writing the book on how tech companies are marketed.  he‚Äôs approaching it with transparency rather than secrecy.  and this makes the company much harder to value because there‚Äôs no ‚Äúwhat magic will they come up with next?‚Äù mystery.  it‚Äôs just what you can glean from a highly technical ai day and a bunch of youtube videos.

the optimus bot is a perfect example of this.  imagine the fawning masses of people that would be buying apple stock if apple was ‚Äúrumored to be releasing a humanoid robot‚Äù.  even if it wasn‚Äôt due for many, many years.  the growth multiple applied to tesla is reduced because of elon‚Äôs direct communication. vs apple‚Äôs highly choreographed ad campaigns and secrecy.  i think we all know this be true.",60,,deadjawa,0

* die apple earnings waren ziemlich gut. allerdings gibt es keine guidance f√ºr q1 wegen der covid-pandemie. infolgedessen verliert $aapl -3,85% und f√§llt auf ~113‚Ç¨. https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/technologie/apple-forciert-datenschutz-rekordquartal-101.html
* viel ist ansonsten nicht passiert: ""*wollte gerade den daily sub lesen um mal von gme wegzukommen, aber hier geht es ja auch nur noch um gme. wir k√∂nnten den sub ja direkt r/gme nennen.*"" u/martymcfly3107
* msw kauft den -4,32% home24-dip bei 20,48‚Ç¨. $h24
* trade republic zickt seit tagen rum und scheint mit dem gro√üen neukundenzuwachs nicht klarzukommen. u/dronix111: ""*man kann order nicht l√∂schen, handel pl√∂tzlich nicht mehr √ºber l&amp;s m√∂glich, k√§ufe und verk√§ufe werden im feed erst stunden sp√§ter angezeigt, steuern werden selbst nach 2 tagen nicht richtig verbucht. was ist los mit denen? haben die da 5 mitarbeiter und werden √ºberrannt oder was?*""
* sp√§ter wird trade republic zeitweise keine k√§ufe der aktien von gamestop ($gme), amc entertainment ($amc), blackberry ($bb), nokia ($nok), express ($epxr) sowie bed bath &amp; beyond ($bbby) annehmen. anscheinend w√§ren diese ""*aktuell gegenstand von heftigen, koordinierten kursspekulationen. wegen der damit verbundenen risiken f√ºr dich nehmen wir bis auf weiteres keine neuen auftr√§ge zum kauf dieser aktien an.*"" auch aktien wie $amd und $mrna k√∂nnen auf robinhood zeitweise nicht gekauft werden. [in einem interview erkl√§rt der trade republic-gr√ºnder hecker sp√§ter, dass trade republic f√ºr einen freien markt eintreten w√ºrde.](https://www.capital.de/geld-versicherungen/trade-republic-ceo-es-handelt-sich-um-einen-beispiellosen-fall)
* der aktion√§r und andere medien berichten von einem [koordinierten run der reddit-trader auf silber.](https://www.deraktionaer.de/artikel/gold-rohstoffe/first-majestic-silver-wahnsinn-20224634.html) silber futures werden die n√§chsten handelstage um +15% pumpen und fast genauso schnell wieder abverkauft werden. am 02.02.21 sinken sie so um knapp 10%. interessanter sidefact von u/monotonup: jpmorgan musste erst k√ºrzlich eine (l√§cherlich geringe) strafe wegen der kursmanipulation von edelmetallen begleichen.

**gamestop-sammelf√§den**:

* so freunde der sonne, daf√ºr lest ihr den schei√ü doch. heute ist der tag der tage. kann nur empfehlen sich beide f√§den nochmal selbst zu gem√ºte zu f√ºhren, ansonsten versuche ich so gut es geht  den ganzen bums zusammenzufassen. war damals nicht teil der affen und bereue es ein bisschen.
* $gme verzeichnet an einem einzigen b√∂rsentag kurse in einer spanne von $112 bis zu $483!! auf tradegate wird das ath von 420‚Ç¨ erreicht. nichtsdestotrotz beendet gamestop den b√∂rsentag rot bei -40% und $193/167‚Ç¨ - nur um in den ah wieder hochzupumpen. 
* genau wie tr verhindert auch das amerikanische pendant robinhood den kauf von gamestop-aktien. zus√§tzlich k√∂nnen dortige anleger allerdings nicht einmal verkaufen. auch degiro schr√§nkt market-orders, trailing-stop-losses und stop losses auf gme ein. f√ºr viele ein gl√ºcksfall, weil die hecken einsicht in gesetzte sl h√§tten.
* u/ridicolousknight2: ""*ich h√§tte niemals, absolut niemals mit dem fast gleichzeitigen aussetzen des handels bei brokern auf der gesamten welt gerechnet.
das sind absolut ekelerregende dimensionen. unglaublicher tag.*""
* robinhood f√§llt von 4,4* auf 1,4* √≠m google-playstore. auch traderepublic f√§llt in der gunst der rezensenten enorm.
* u/bolltan: ""*tr macht den chad move und verbietet papierh√§nden den verkauf, geniales 5d schach*""
* u/norgenx l√∂scht seinen limit-verkauf bei 820‚Ç¨, nachdem tr ihn gelassen hat.
* u/eatmatesticles ""*was ein geiles gef√ºhl. so als w√§re man seit tagen auf einem festival. die gleichen leute, das gleiche ziel. mega üöÄ*""
* u/lalo1848 ""*soll ich bei tinder mal einen bild hochladen mit meinem entry bei gme von 14,70 euro? meint ihr das zieht?*""
* u/yolidiot legt noch einmal 5000‚Ç¨ nach.
* u/fortunofficial sogar noch mehr: ""*so leute, jetzt bin ich zu 100% investiert. ich habe 90 st√ºck nachgekauft. bin jetzt bei 942 st√ºck mit durchschnitt 69‚Ç¨ einstand. derzeit üíØ tausend ‚Ç¨ gewinn. diese wichser machen mich zum million√§r. und wir b√ºgeln auch noch die hurens√∂hne, die uns kleinanleger mit allen erdenklichen illegalen mitteln kleinhalten wollen. zum verfickten üåì ihr pisser*""
* u/leaststrike: ""*seit das ganze richtig politisch geworden ist und sich immer gr√∂√üere akteure einmischen, macht das ganze mehr und mehr stress. bin nat√ºrlich immernoch entschlossen, das wie geplant durchzuziehen, aber gestern war schon zehrend. mehr wegen der zahlreichen stellungnahmen von offiziellen seiten und den wilden ger√ºchten, die rumflogen, als wegen des kurses.*""
* und es wurde richtig politisch. alexandria ocasio-cortez √§u√üert sich auf twitter √§u√üert kritisch √ºber den trading halt seitens robinhood und k√ºndigt eine anh√∂rung an. justin sun kauft zur markter√∂ffnung $gme im wert von 1.000.000 usd und k√ºndigt unterst√ºtzung aus asien an. [elon musk bezeichnet shorting als scam](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354890601649610753). chamath palihapitiya spricht von ""true corporatist scumbags."" wsb geht wieder privat. autisten von √ºberall auf der welt kommen in den sammelfaden und stehen seite an seite mit den affen im krieg gegen die hecken. #gamestop trendet global auf twitter. elon musk, demokraten und republikaner verurteilen robinhood und stellen sich in sozialen medien gemeinsam auf die seite der kleinanleger. memes, songs, gainporn - √ºberall auf der welt scheint einigkeit zu herrschen, eine internationale bewegung ist endg√ºltig geboren.
* u/gumba_hasselhoff: *""montag: alter, wir scheiben hier finanzgeschichte. donnerstag: alter, wir schreiben hier weltgeschichte.*""
* u/wabty: ""*f√ºr mich ist das kein trading mehr sondern klassenkampf. fick die hamptons.*""
* u/jimmie448: *fake news, der ""zuf√§llige"" ausfall der broker gestern, wsb discord ban, bots √ºberall... den kurzhosen geht der stift und hier werden alle mittel ausgepackt um das bisschen neu gefundene momentum der kleinanleger mit aller gewalt wieder abzuw√ºrgen.
geht gar nicht... papierh√§nde hin oder her, das ist kein meme mehr, wer vor freitag n√§chster woche verkauft macht mit diesen methoden gemeinsame sache.*""
* kurze impressionen aus den marschrufen von √ºbersee: 
* love you germany, here from the uk. keep fighting. this is a team effort. we won‚Äôt let you down either
* hold the line, my german brothers!
british wsb autist here trading on nyse.

* bei close: nokia: -28%. amc: -57%. expr: -50%. bb: -41%. sie alle machen den $gme-pump und auch den dump mit, aber nur wenige schaffen den rebound.
* u/bandito55: ""*diese einbr√ºche werden von den shorts verursacht, die versuchen, den kurs zu dr√ºcken. sie verkaufen geliehene aktien. schon wieder. aneinander. sie verdoppeln ihren einsatz. sie versuchen, sie zum verkauf zu verleiten.
jede aktie, die sie verkaufen, ist geliehen. sie muss zur√ºckbezahlt werden. sie werden sie zur√ºckkaufen und zur√ºckzahlen m√ºssen.
jeder einbruch ist nur ein weiterer anstieg, der nur darauf wartet, zu passieren.*""
* soon may the tendieman come.

1643380120,"man, i wish i could post on ape subreddits because i really don‚Äôt understand the drs hype and want to ask them why they think it‚Äôs important.

as far as i‚Äôve looked into, drs just means the shares can‚Äôt be borrowed. this just means people can‚Äôt short from that percentage.

mass buying a stock and divorcing it from any metric value doesn‚Äôt really cause buying pressure, right? it just causes the stock to be overvalued, especially if it‚Äôs not shorted.

so, if they are trying to prevent shorting, drs is the way. but that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre trying to do it seems‚Ä¶

i‚Äôm also confused as to why they want other people to buy in and are trying to add revenue to gamestop‚Äôs  quarterlies. if a company is doing well, why do you need to actively pump the numbers? lots of people own apple stock but don‚Äôt own a single apple device.  also, i thought the point of game stop was to make money on some sky high price? don‚Äôt you want hedge funds to buy it instead of other retail traders? if you just want anyone to buy to drive up the price, isn‚Äôt that a pump and dump? if not, are you hoping that the price gets high enough for margin calls?

either i‚Äôm missing something or it doesn‚Äôt make sense. as soon as i started learning about it after i sold, i became skeptic. the more i learn, the more i‚Äôm confused.

hell, i‚Äôm still trying to figure out who cares about reverse repo rates‚Ä¶.",9,,gme_neutral,0

of course, if one did that and held to now while always doing the same boring contributions and reinvesting dividends, the cagr would improve slightly to 31.56%...and you'd be sitting on $4,178,918. how about those compound gains? all while doing next to nothing.

my best friend's mom's second husband is a good guy. but he went straight to work out of high school and never had the opportunity to learn about money. back in the day there were no ""for dummies"" books, no convenient apps, no youtube etc. and he worked 50 hours a week supporting his family. he spared no expense either; his kids had everything they wanted. in the end, he'd gotten screwed his whole life by credit cards, banks, his pension fund/union, friends, ex-wives, you name it lol--because he did not know how to protect himself, save and invest wisely, etc. now his crap pension is all he has and his kids give him nothing. if he'd been armed with knowledge in his 20s, 30s and 40s his economic state would be much better now. a lot of people just feel helpless and powerless about money. that's not right and it's not necessary. i am not a taylaaaaa fan but if she is simply encouraging her young viewers to empower themselves with knowledge and at least try to learn how to save and grow their money--even if they can only put away five bucks a month, it's still not a bad message at all.",1,,DarkHighways,0

1643471012,"hi there,

firstly, is the artist tag properly multi-value? if so, `%artist%` tag is displayed with commas but probably does not include actual commas. check in *right-click track &gt; properties* \- if artists are separated with semi-colons ; then the tag is probably multi-value. in which case use `$meta(artist,0)` to get first artist. (could try it in a playlist column to see)

next if you mean searching online, i'm not sure you'd get many results with eslyric anyway. better to use one of the other two [lyrics components](https://www.reddit.com/r/foobar2000/comments/o7ua73/lyric_show_panel_3_lyrics_from_genius_musixmatch/) to search, perhaps batch saving local lyrics, and then display them with eslyric if you like (it still has the best display options for mind)

it looks like the setting is under *preferences &gt; tools &gt; eslyric &gt; search &gt; advanced button &gt; under search parameters, 'enable custom search parameters' &gt; setting...* and then i assume replace `%artist%` with the string. i have never done that myself though so really no idea if that works.",2,,ghstchldrn,0

1643472887,"in 1971 m. karunanidhi after completing one year in office begins to start working on what his predecessor c.n. annadurai planned on doing.

in september 1971 a board to plan the proceedings is formed under the chairmanship of periyar, the board consisted of ex prime ministers rajaji, v.n. neduncheyian, kamarajar and other prominent people like s. ramasamy and ex chief of army staff p.p. kumaramangalam.

this board had many deaths including the chairman periyar. finally in may of 1972 the board voted to rescue dravidian people stuck in bharat before, the rebellions begin. the navy begun preparations with chief of the naval staff oscar stanley dawson being ordered to start moving vessels to mangalore harbour. 

in july spies disguised as defectors from bharat, using their identity cards went to mumbai and began finding out dravidians there. they explained what was about to happen and what they are to do. the instructions given were to 

-speak to your neighbours about moving to another place within bharat.

-withdraw money slowly from their bank accounts.

-keep a radio provided by the dravidian government at all times

-pack only the bare essentials

almost every dravidian family is bombay decided to accept the offer. after the success of this the programme qas extended to other cities like prayagraj, pune, ashaval, meerut, cuttack and surat.

in september, the spies bribed some dockworkers in the harbour. the dravidian navy started buying tugboats to transport the people from bombay waters where after which they exit bombay waters they will board the dns madras, dns cochin and dns madura.

in october the families were readied to leave, in the early hours of the 4th of november the dravidian families in bandra, colaba and matunga were made to come to worli, from the jetty they boarded ferries and tugboats and ventured 4 kms into the sea where the dns cochin was waiting for them. they boarded the vessel and set sail for mangalore.

around 2500 people were rescued that day, it was kept under wraps so no one knows about it. they were temporarily placed in a housing complex in suburban mangalore until the operations ended. they were given free electricity, water and food. 25 schools and 10 colleges were established but not all fully functional yet. it would start operating as people are rescued.

its an attractive solution because at the moment our dollar is a bit too strong to justify conversion and un-hedged use (for my liking). so i can put some money into these cdrs of safe(ish) companies, let it do its thing and when our dollar goes back to historical numbers then i can take the profits and buy the actual stock of the company.
also, they offer costco, berkshire, google, etc. most people can't buy into these companies and fractional shares are only through ws which charges an additional 1.5% in conversion fees each time you buy and sell. this way if you're interested in benefiting from good companies like berkshire and google but don't have 7k lying around, you still can.

1643480424,"valuation doesn't have to be precise, but knowing reasonable ranges of valuation that would apply under a range of market conditions would have at least have the newbie thetagangers knowledgeable about what they were doing.

the problem with selling options is that your upside is capped by the premium collected but downside is not.

simple exercise.  stocks like $fb, $msft, $goog are dominant in their fields and generate cash flow like crazy, so the only risk is whether the market will give those companies a multiple of 15, 20, or 30x cash flow.  knowing where they currently sit in that valuation range will get you most of what you need to know whether you're taking a big risk at the strike you're writing.

stocks like $rivn, $ride, $spce - those are just story stocks.  high premium and iv for sure, but what can the downside look like? with these, you're always taking a big risk, regardless if the stock is down 25, 50, or 75% from its peak.

i don't think that believing in them as a long term investment helps because it goes back to the problem that most retail investors don't know how to assess the quality of an investment.  they are overly influenced by recent prices and social affirmation.

in any case, take this with a grain of salt.  it‚Äôs reddit.

0. bitcoin can‚Äôt become a *stable* global currency until it has deep deep liquidity on both buy and sell sides, and has gained much more adoption.  what % of businesses today do vs. do not accept bitcoin?  clearly we are far from meeting adoption goals and early, so there‚Äôs no way bitcoin should be ‚Äústable‚Äù right now.

1. not sure i understand question 1.  what is the problem here?  businesses that accept bitcoin as payment don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúcope‚Äù with anything.  they can convert to stablecoin or fiat, they can hold as bitcoin on their balance sheet, or more commonly, they can have a combination of the two where they hold some % on the balance sheets and convert some % if the amount they have on their balance sheets gets too large for their appetite.  volatility isn‚Äôt bad inherently.  **do we ask large pension funds how they cope with having some highly volatile nvda stock in the mix on their holdings?**  i guess we don‚Äôt have adoption yet (back to point 0. above), so almost no business is operating entirely in btc on all levels, so it‚Äôs east to manage volatility.

2. again, see number 0.  bitcoin also is not ‚Äúpegged‚Äù to the usd, there is just an exchange rate between btc/usd and people used to thinking in terms of dollars want to know ‚Äúhow much usd is that?‚Äù or people used to mexican pesos want to know ‚Äúhow many pesos is that?‚Äù.  if you were used to thinking in btc, you would want to know ‚Äúhow many sats is that?‚Äù for a coffee, or bitcoin for larger ticket items.

3. bitcoin could he a hedge against inflation in the longterm, and it certainly has been a great hedge against inflation in the past in the sense that anyone who invested in bitcoin and held long enough was rewarded with inflation adjusted returns so great, even today with inflation on the rise and bitcoin down, you made enough return that you are *crushing* inflation.  this same trend can continue in the future, as clearly the longterm end game shows bitcoin demand increasing, while the supply stays the same.  i do not have a crystal ball, but the ‚Äútokenomics‚Äù *long term* do suggest a great hedge against inflation.  **i think the mistake people make is thinking that bitcoin is a short-term hedge against inflation that should quickly react to cpi numbers as they come out in a manner that has a direct negative correlation with them or the fed/treasury yield curves and such.**  with the liquidity where it is today, that is an unrealistic expectation.  also, bitcoin may be down, only in part, on speculation of a strengthening dollar and the fed raising rates to combat inflation, and was up on the opposite thesis, so there is some semblance of negative correlation there, but the game-changer is a long term fight against inflation over decades, not short term speculation and ‚Äúnoise‚Äù.  bitcoin has historically done an amazing job crushing inflation adjusted returns long term over 5 - 10 yr periods, and has historically been too volatile to count on that over short term 1 - 2 yr periods, so why expect that to change ‚Äúover night‚Äù??",2,,Longjumping-Tie7445,0

1643497412,"i never said anything like that and there is no such thing as 100% certainty. my point is that there are fundamental *structural* problems with crypto-currencies that will cause them all to fail at some point. stocks have no such existential analog. crypto-currencies are enormously risky and have zero backing except hype. you can certainly make a lot of money with wildly volatile instruments like bitcoin, but you're also liable to lose everything. 

show me the last time the s&amp;p500 went bankrupt. show me the last time the nasdaq-100 went bankrupt. a catastrophic ""correction"" in these etfs is a 10-20% temporary dip that usually recovers in a month or two. crypto-currencies can plummet that much in a single *day* and never recover. 

you ""invest"" in stocks. you ""gamble"" on crypto-currencies. we *do know* for a fact with 100% certainty that there are structural issues with crypto-currencies: 1) they are either finite or infinite, and are therefore subject to the verification crisis or hyperinflation. 2) they have zero intrinsic value or ""backing"" (with a handful of exceptions like usd-pinned coins and commodity-backed coins). once the hype is gone, the effective price plummets. 3) they are extremely sensitive to legislation: china has effectively banned them. other governments may severely restrict them in the future, arresting their volatility and potential. 

i agree with your point on day-trading options being a form of speculative gambling. we call that ""rich man's blackjack."" at the same time, you can consider it ""informed gambling"" if you time a short-term options purchase with a news event like a fed meeting, an earnings report, etc. 

for example, we often sell covered calls when a stock is high and trim them when the stock dips. you may have noticed that we are in a significant s&amp;p dip... so i leveraged our aapl stock with additional calls purchased shortly before their earnings report this week for a $160 strike with an ""informed gamble"" on a good q4 and fy21 report. the calls themselves tripled and compounded our return over the past week to over 20% on that batch. had the report been bad, the gamble with owning calls is that we wouldn't have lost nearly as much money as had we owned a lot more aapl stock.

now that wasn't 20% return over the whole portfolio because aapl only represents about 8% of what we hold in that fund.

the difference between your crypto-currency gamble and my informed hedging of well-known securities is that your bet may skyrocket or plummet with unknown certainty and an unknown timeline, both widely variable; whereas i can produce consistent long-term returns based on a client's risk tolerance and time horizon. 

that's gambling versus investing.",0,,RogueSoldier10012,0

[&gt; does anyone who holds or contemplated or even simply researched roku have a bullish or in this case bearish argument to explain what's happening? would you say it's a buy?  i brought recently because it seems cheap. it was expensive last year though and most of the selling has been warranted so i'm not expecting it to jump back to $500 or anything, but in recent months it seems that a lot of the selling has been purely sentiment driven and not based on fundamentals. roku is both a growth stock and one of cathie wood's largest holdings, neither of which investors want to touch right now. there has also been growing short interest on the stock over the past few months and this whole set up seems very similar to what happened to hood recently. that stock had some awful sentiment surrounding it into earnings which didn't really line up with fundamentals, which although bad, weren't that bad. roku is in a much better place than hood given that it's actually a decent company with a decent product that people like. i'm not as much of a fan of roku as cathie is, but i think it's probably worth closer to $200-$250. those saying it's expensive because of it's 70 pe valuation or whatever don't know what they're talking about imo. i personally prefer to look at ev/ebitda and at 48 that's pretty damn respectable for a company that's been growing at 40-50% a year. even just comparing to it's own average historical valuation, it's clearly on discount right now.  i can see the bear case for the stock though. they're in a very crowded market and it's hard to say what the long-term future is for them given they don't really have much of a competitive advantage and they're up against some huge companies. but right now they seem to be growing fast, people like what they're doing and they're turning a decent profit. it's kinda hard not to like the stock.](/r/stocks/comments/sfo9jl/opinions_about_roku_down_65_why_is_it_dipping_and/huse0su/)

1643589578,"so, we all agree that the 30m number is bunk and the total number of gpus is likely a lot lower. 

that being said, i read your original comment as a challenge because it had a very argumentative [tone](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zmfc7ty/articles/z6smxyc), making it seem like you were disagreeing with him.

&gt;what ""makes sense"" is the growth of eth hashrate over the past year however. you can then subdevide that in number of gpus.  
&gt;  
&gt;while some of it will be aiscs and amd cards, most of it will be ampere. i would not touch nvidia stock with a 10 foot pole right now.

note: 

1. your opening of ""what 'makes sense' is"" in quotations. 
2. your use of the word ""however"" 
3. your conclusion sentence

1643656309,"first of all, you did the right thing by thinking about fire. a lot of people your age would be thinking lambo, and that always leads to disaster.

this may come across as rude, but remember. you're 22. there is a alarming high number of lottery winners that go bankrupt not long after winning. coming into a large amount of money in a short amount of time when you're young is almost always a recipe for disaster if mismanaged. seek the advice of a professional financial advisor and cpa.

it's perfectly ok and wise to understand your limitations. i would not have known what to do with that amount at 22. the most important thing to know is that if you keep your life normal. don't be extravagant. if you are frugal, you could retire within 10 years, or you could not retire early and have the wonderful freedom to work in a field/job that you love that pays most of the bills and let's you enjoy your freedom. most people have to choose between a good paying job and what they love. your financial situation could let you choose to always do what you love and still be financially ok.

a cpa will know if you have to pay a ton of taxes on that money (if in the us). an advisor should be recommending you to invest in a diversified set of assets (stock index funds, real estate, etc.). watch out for advisors that are just shilling their funds. beware of too heavy a concentration into one thing (e.g. just apple stock, etc.).

from a personal perspective, do not tell your friends and limit the number of family members that know. even people that seem great will turn on you and resent you. you don't want that. also, stay aware of your mental health. this can be very stressful to deal with at such a young age.

congrats and fuck you (kidding).",304,,ret1024,0

we have yet to see the regulations, there may be exceptions or allowances etc but it's not like you have a choice in the matter. either you report a taxable event on your taxes or you're breaking the law and you can be fined or jailed. it's not like it's impossible to commit tax fraud, people don't do it because they don't want to be fined or jailed.

edit: also you know how taxes on these things work right? you would get taxed on the increase in value, it's not like you get taxed 20% of the entire value every time it changes to a new crypto. if you paid $500,001 for that eth it would be a ""taxable event"" that nets you a tax credit for your losses.",1,,nemoomen,0
