Transaction reports filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, show her husband bought 5,000 Nvidia shares in July 2021, and that he exercised options to buy another 20,000 Nvidia shares last June.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage in coming days of legislation providing about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The legislation, which aims to make the domestic chip industry more competitive with China's, would then be taken up in the U.S. House under Pelosi's direction.

Last year, Pelosi defended the rights of federal lawmakers to trade stocks, but she later responded to calls for a ban on trading by lawmakers by signaling willingness to potentially advance such legislation.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

1660308834,dow jones futures rise as apple stock nears buy point,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0f1a84d0-b4ac-3fb7-8362-7d6e30aff3cd/dow-jones-futures-rise-as.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0f1a84d0-b4ac-3fb7-8362-7d6e30aff3cd/dow-jones-futures-rise-as.html)

 Dow Jones futures rose Friday, looking to cap a solid weekly gain as both the Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 set sights on their fourth straight weekly advance. Tech titan Apple stock is closing in on its latest buy point, as it heads for a six-week win streak. 

On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed a 1% gain to just 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 reversed slightly lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended down 0.6%, after an early 1.3% rally found stout resistance around the 13,000 level. The Nasdaq remains higher for the week, and on track for a four-week win streak.",0,1,Raw_Rain,StockMarket

1660452563,why warren buffett loves apple stock,"After reading the book, Buffetology, I can see why Warren Buffett loves Apple stock. 

## Apple products have a massive consumer monopoly
If you raised $100 billion and hired the best people you could find, you can't exactly build a competitor that will threaten Apple's position in the market. Apple has a massive competitive advantage. Their products are in a class of their own.

## Apple has a massive ROE
Equity is the shareholder's money in the business. A very high return on equity means the company's management is doing a great job allocating shareholder's capital. Apple's ROE over the last three years was 150%, 88%, and 61%. This is similar to Warren Buffett's investment in Coca-Cola. Coke had a very high ROE and still has. 

## Apple is returning a lot of money back to shareholders
Apple has been buying back shares aggressively, reducing the number of available shares and increasing the value of shares held by current shareholders. Share buybacks reduce shareholders' equity, but this is good because the equity is returned to shareholders. In fact, Apple's equity growth rate numbers are negative because shareholders' equity has been dropping because of their aggressive buybacks.

## Apple is a cash cow
Apple is producing massive cash flow with $93 Billion in Free Cash Flow and $366 Billion in Revenue in 2021. 

## Apple has trustworthy management
Tim cook appears to be a steady hand that can be trusted.

## Is Apple a buy right now?
Apple seems almost reasonably valued today. I would wait for it to go on sale to buy. A stock with Apple's momentum will only go on sale during historical market crashes where every stock and all major indices drop big. Hard to imagine a day like that today after the bounce since the last month. But the market can flip anytime with no warning. 

I don't own any Apple stock, but I will buy it if I can get it on sale with a wide margin of safety. I like to have very high odds of making a great return.",3,0,clark_k3nt,DecodeInvesting

1660839148,"dow jones futures rise: costco rival breaking out, time to bite into apple stock?"," Dow Jones futures rose modestly Thursday morning, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. 

The stock market rally pulled back Wednesday amid key resistance. The major indexes initially pared losses following the release of Fed minutes from the July 27-28 meeting, but faded again by the close.

**Apple** (**AAPL**) cleared a trendline entry, with the megacap stock technically actionable ahead of an official breakout.

Chip design firm **Synopsys** (**SNPS**) and lagging Dow Jones tech giant **Cisco Systems** (**CSCO**) reported late Wednesday. SNPS stock rose slightly and Cisco stock popped in extended action on strong earnings and guidance.

Lithium giant **Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile** (**SQM**) released mixed results very early Thursday. SQM stock fell in premarket trade.

**BJ's Wholesale** (**BJ**), a rival to **Costco Wholesale** (**COST**), beat views before the open. BJ's stock rose solidly, signaling a move above a buy point Costco is just in a buy zone.

## BBBY Stock Tumbles

Meanwhile, newly revived meme stock **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** (**BBBY**) fell more than 10% early Thursday, but well off overnight lows. BBBY stock rose 12% to 23.08 in Wednesday's session, but closed near session lows after hitting a five-month high of 30 intraday.

Shares jumped 29% in massive volume on Tuesday as **GameStop** (**GME**) Chairman Ryan Cohen disclosed he still owns BBBY stock along with significant out-of-the-money options.

But late Wednesday, Cohen disclosed his intention to completely exit BBBY stock.

GME stock, the original meme stock, retreated overnight after falling 4% Wednesday. **AMC Entertainment** (**AMC**), another meme stock, fell 14% in the regular session.

## Fed Minutes

Federal Reserve policymakers at the late July meeting agreed that further rate hikes are necessary, according to the newly released Fed minutes.

Declining commodity prices, including energy, aren't enough, according to the Fed minutes, with policymakers stressing that inflation pressures are broad-based. But they also worried about slowing the economy too much.

They didn't seem concerned that financial conditions eased since the June meeting, including lower Treasury yields and a stock market rally.

All in all, the **Fed minutes held no hawkish surprises**, slightly easing rate hike expectations.

Still, markets now see a 61.5% chance of a 50-basis-point Fed rate hike on Sept. 21. Earlier Wednesday, before the Fed minutes release, odds were about evenly divided between a half-point move or a third straight 75-basis-point move.

## Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.25%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%. CSCO stock is a member of the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite.

Crude oil futures rose 1%. Natural gas futures added nearly 2%.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell 4 basis points to 2.85%.

Remember that overnight action in **Dow futures** and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular **stock market** session.

# ETFs

Among the **best ETFs**, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (**FFTY**) fell just over 1%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (**BOUT**) shed 0.5%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (**IGV**) slumped 1.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (**SMH**) retreated 2.15%. SNPS stock is in the IGV and SMH ETFs.

SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) declined 2.7% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) sank 1.1%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) descended 2.5%. SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) shed 1.7%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) gained 0.8% and the Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) slipped 0.5%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) fell 0.6%.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (**ARKK**) tumbled 5.3% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) 5.1%.

# Apple Stock

Apple stock, a member of the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite, rose 0.9% to 174.55 on Wednesday. AAPL stock moved above a down-sloping trendline going back to early January. That offers a buying opportunity.

The official **buy point** is 183.04, according to **MarketSmith analysis**. Investors could view the Apple stock chart as an awkward **double-bottom base** with a 179.71 entry.

AAPL stock rose in volume that was slightly above normal. But most of its strong uptrend over the past two months has been on below-average trade. The tech titan could use a break. A handle would create a lower buy point and let the moving averages catch up.

 Apple stock is outperforming other megacaps and the broader market: Its **relative strength line**, the blue line in the charts provided, has been hitting record highs for a few weeks.

## Key Earnings

SQM earnings surged 871% vs. a year earlier, but still missed views. Revenue leapt 342%, beating. SQM stock fell 2% before the open. Shares dipped 1.2% to 104.42 on Wednesday after skidding 5.1% Tuesday in a downside reversal. SQM stock is working on a 115.86 cup-base buy point. Shares topped a 99.84 early entry last week from a too-low handle, but could test that area on Thursday. A proper handle would be ideal for SQM stock.

Lithium rivals **Albemarle** (**ALB**) and **Livent** (**LTHM**) both reported strong earnings earlier this month, with the industry giant Albemarle sharply raising guidance yet again. ALB and LTHM stock edged lower in premarket trade.

#  Market Rally Analysis

A day after the S&amp;P 500 stopped just short of the 200-day moving average, the major indexes pulled back Wednesday. The Fed minutes moved stocks but they ultimately closed about where they were at 2 p.m. ET.

Small caps and highly valued growth stocks were the biggest losers, but declines were broad-based outside of energy.

The Dow Jones held support at its 200-day line. The Russell 2000 undercut that key level. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have not reached it. 

The market rally has come a long way from its June lows with the 200-day line a clear resistance area. So this is an obvious time and place for the major indexes to pause or pull back.

For now, the market rally seems reluctant to cede much ground. Arguably, a bit more of a pullback would be constructive. It would let Apple and other stocks that have run up the right side of bases take a break and form handles.

But the market is going to do what it's going to do. The indexes could quickly run past the 200-day line or retreat sharply to the 50-day line, or worse.

# What to Do Now

Stocks tend to follow the market and industry trends. That's why it's so important to pay attention to the general market, adding exposure in confirmed uptrends and moving largely or entirely to cash in corrections.

With the market hitting resistance at the 200-day line, investors should wait before adding to net exposure. They could consider taking some partial profits.

But keep working on watchlists. A market pause that refreshes could create major opportunities.
