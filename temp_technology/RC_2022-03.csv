1646094435,"tsla trading volume was slightly elevated today, just over 32.2 million shares traded compared to 26.2 million on average.

it's too soon to know for sure, but the ""buyer's strike"" might now be over.  i believe institutional investors would be foolish going forward not to have at least some investment in tsla.

according to  [yahoo! finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/holders?p=tsla), just under than 3300 institutions own tsla, and collectively hold around 52% of the float and 43% of total shares.

this compares to just under 5400 institutions owning aapl, at just under 60% of the float and total shares.  microsoft stock is held by over 5800 institutions, and they collectively own about 72% of the float and total shares.

i believe that buying pressure is on our side.  there's a lot of tsla retail who have extreme conviction in the company and will not sell most of their shares anytime soon.  institutions who didn't get in prior to s&amp;p500 inclusion will be paying out the nose to acquire shares",20,,Magikarp_to_Gyarados,0

1646095470,"&gt;what is exactly stopping someone from buying telsa with microsoft stocks at the moment? 

you can buy that, but it wouldn't be tied to tesla stock anymore. like, let's say, you have 10 tesla stocks and each stock is priced for $2 and each microsoft stock is priced with $4. now you want to buy microsoft stock with your 2 tesla stock - which basically means you can only buy 1 microsoft stock because your 2 tesla stock worths only 1 microsoft stock at that time. the moment you sell your tesla stocks and buy microsoft stock, you are tied to 100% microsoft stocks' market value. your previous 2 tesla stocks are no longer related to tesla because you - in a way - exchanged that with one microsoft stock. so after your transaction even if tesla skyrocketed, you wouldn't earn from it because you already exchanged your stocks with microsoft ones. 

same with bitcoin. if you buy microsoft stock with bitcoin, now you will pay the market value of microsoft stock at that time in usd with an equivalent amount of btc. after the transaction, you are no longer tied to btc - what you own only related to usd/msf value. now if you say, in far far future, people adopt btc as day-to-day currency, then you wouldn't have any measurement to ""fluctuate"" like we have in btc since this fluctuation happens usd/btc pair. and if you remove usd in the equation and adopt btc, then btc wouldn't fluctuate over anything and your stock value will be evaluated based on btc/msf pair",1,,namingisterrible,0

none of these mattered other than apple.  the big personal website of the future was founded by someone who at the time was also 14 and in high school.    


guessing the specific company this early on gives me that feeling of nostalgia i had in the late 90s.   we have no idea what companies are going to be the leaders in 2030.  the tesla folks say all the others are shit, all the others say tesla is shit.  its meaningless.   the safest approach 25 years ago was pick 20 and hopefully you got a few hits.",5,,rileyoneill,0

first, consider the product $av$ where $a$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $v$ is an $n$-dimensional vector. as my professor explained, we should think of the result $av$ as being a linear combination of the columns of $a$, where the coefficient of the $i$th column of $a$ in the linear combination is simply the $i$th entry of $v$.

this can be then generalized to matrix multiplication, where the $i$th column in the result $ab$ is a linear combination of the columns of $a$, where the coefficients are given by the entries in the $i$th column of $b$.

just because they're dominant today, doesn't mean they will be in the future. if only we knew.

consider the way apple dominated the (then dominate) and established competition in a decade, why couldn't another company do the same and oust apple in three decades?

as an offnote i'd consider microsoft as having a larger moat than apple.

also what's to stop a chinese/african/indian company from blowing up in the next thirty years? 30 years ago was the 1990's, i don't think anyone in the 1990's could predict with significant accuracy what companies would be a dominate force in the 2020's (maybe microsoft?).

1646122693,"&gt;with the dominance of $aapl today,

this is imo key to your entire opinion. apple already has no dominance today. they have fanboys willing to pay extraordinary margins, thats for sure. but at the basis, the core of the company itself, its all but good.

we all know the stories, benchmarks, comparisons that for the price of a $1000 you can purchase an iphone that is at a level most competitors sell at 200-300 bucks level. a philosophy which then moves trough all the apple products.

examples like wether we're looking at desktop (&lt;10%) or mobile soft/hardware (&lt;30%). wether its apple tv (&lt;5%) or music (&lt;15%). their market share is amazingly low where-ever you look. they dont come remotely close to their real competitors like windows or android that have 80% market shares in their fields, or disney/spotify names which dominate those respective streaming scenes.

sure from investment point of view you can state they have good diversification or something, maybe even decent moat because of how much margins the fanboys are willing to pay extra just for the branding. but fact is that all they touch over the past 10-ish years structuraly fail to become a succes story. it almost exclusively gets adopted by the same hardcore fanbase that carries the company since the '90s.... but they keep being left on the sidelines by the global population.

&amp;#x200b;

which then leads to a cloudy 20-30 year outlook. if whatever you want, there's a name doing far better than apple.... what makes you think they can sustain growth/outperformance in the light of such superior competition?",-5,,Qorvos,0

&gt;  el transporte marítimo, afectado por la crisis de suministros, enfrenta ahora tensiones por la guerra en ucrania. tres buques comerciales han sido bombardeados y las aseguradoras se niegan a dar cobertura a los que navegan por el mar negro.
&gt; 
&gt; efectos de una crisis que apenas comienza. la danesa maersk, una de las principales navieras del mundo, anunció la suspensión temporal de todo el transporte de contenedores marítimos hacia y desde rusia debido al [conflicto con ucrania.](https://www.france24.com/es/tag/ucrania/)
&gt; 
&gt; ""nuevos pedidos por mar y por tierra hacia y desde rusia serán suspendidos con la excepción de alimentos, medicinas y ayuda humanitaria. la suspensión afectará a todos los puertos rusos"", señaló en un comunicado a.p. møller-mærsk, propietario de la naviera.
&gt; 
&gt; maersk, que opera rutas de transporte de contenedores a san petersburgo y kaliningrado en el mar báltico, novorossiysk en el mar negro, y vladivostok y vostochny en la costa este de rusia, aseguró que que la estabilidad y la seguridad de sus actividades se ven ya afectadas de forma directa e indirecta por las sanciones internacionales.
&gt; 
&gt; ""vemos retrasos en los puertos debido a las inspecciones de aduanas de todas las mercancías que van a rusia, y a la vez los cambios en las condiciones de crédito influyen en las posibilidades de los clientes de cumplir con sus obligaciones"", informa la naviera en la nota.

&gt; 
&gt; **maersk mueve alrededor del 20 % del transporte mundial por mar** y se reparte la mayoría de contenedores mundiales con la ítalo-suiza mediterranean shipping company. la compañía es dueña del 30 % de global ports, propietaria de cinco terminales de contenedores marítimos en rusia y que cubre varias rutas de transporte a ese país, cuenta con oficinas de representación en varias ciudades, incluidas moscú y san petersburgo.
&gt; 
&gt; **se acentúa el cerco económico de occidente contra rusia**
&gt; 
&gt; occidente impuso duras restricciones a rusia para cerrar su economía y bloquearla del sistema financiero mundial, convirtiéndola en un país ""no invertible"" y animando a las empresas a suspender sus ventas.
&gt; 
&gt; bp y shell, dos importantes empresas energéticas, abandonaron posiciones multimillonarias, mientras que los principales bancos, aerolíneas y fabricantes de automóviles, recortaron sus envíos hacia rusia.
&gt; 
&gt; ""yo esperaría ver una serie de anuncios similares en los próximos días"", dijo el lunes sonia kowal, presidenta de zevin asset management en boston. el grupo petrolero y gasístico totalenergies ttef.pa también dijo que ya no aportará capital para nuevos proyectos en rusia. así mismo, **visa inc v.n y mastercard inc bloquearon a varias instituciones financieras rusas de su red** tras las sanciones impuestas por estados unidos y europa.
&gt; 
&gt; facebook dijo que restringirá el acceso a los medios de comunicación estatales rusos 'rt' y sputnik de sus plataformas en toda la unión europea, mientras que youtube bloqueó los canales conectados a los medios de comunicación rusos y que son respaldados por el estado.
&gt; 
&gt; incluso la americana warner bros suspendió el estreno de esta semana de 'the batman' de las pantallas rusas, luego del anuncio de walt disney co de cancelar el estreno de sus películas en los cines rusos.

first, were the shares you were trying to transfer coming from a msft stock plan account? if so then msft has the right to enforce sale and transfer restrictions, which may be what happened here.

second, and unrelated, you should really check msft's insider and employee trading policies. i would be shocked if the permitted transactions other than during open windows (usually a few weeks after earnings).

finally, those same policies most certainly would not permit borrowing against msft shares because if a margin call happened during a closed window you'd be sold anyway and you'd be violating those policies.

[&gt; only evs that are 40k plus have that type of range.  today yes, but batteries are getting more range for a lower price.  &gt; until you can buy an ev for the same price as a base civic or focus and it has 400 mile range, evs will continue to chip away at a 1% or 2% increase of market share per year.  that will never be the case and is not a realistic requirement for multiple reasons.  for one, evs are much cheaper to own. in the order of thousands of dollars a year cheaper. a $10,000 second hand ice car is comparable in costs to a $50,000 brand new ev if you include all costs over a few years time of ownership.  on top of that, by 2030 ice cars will be roughly twice as expensive as they are today due to inflation, increasing technology costs and reducing economies of scale. meanwhile evs will likely stay roughly the same price, despite inflation and while getting much better specs.  &gt; people aren't all of the sudden going to be able to afford tesla's and audi's because gas prices are high  no, but people who can't afford good evs will just be buying cars on the second hand market. when we talk about ev adoption we're talking exclusively about new car sales.  also keep in mind that many people lease and or have a loan for their cars, so sticker price isn't always the only thing people see when buying a car. right now lease prices are still very high because of the excess demand, or in other words because they can, but once supply catches up they're gonna come down in price fast.  &gt; and as evs gain marketshare, gas prices drop and ice cars get cheaper, slowing the transition.  the opposite is actually true. running fuel stations will become much more expensive as fewer cars need them to stop for gas, so the overhead will start playing a bigger role. even if reduced demand might lower prices, they will probably cancel each other out at best.  &gt; you're also forgetting that those cars would have to be produced. you need to replace the entire north american fleet of vehicles before oil demand really gets hit. that's a massive challenge on its own.  again no, when we're talking about ev adoption we're talking about % of sales, not % of cars on the road.](/r/stocks/comments/t4898g/tell_me_why_i_am_crazy_to_think_oil_will_easily/hyy2tyj/)

[absolutely. part of the art of ta is practicing self-doubt whenever the chart tells you what you want to see. bad ta tries to predict the future. good ta gives you confidence levels and breakpoints to act on should the price action show tendencies in the market.  i leveraged down when i saw the head and shoulders top form in january, and since then i've been playing the fractal pattern to leverage up and down as the market cycled. that made the confidence level for a downward movement really high, but i didn't do it until the trendline broke... that saves you half the decline but keeps you in the market in case it doesn't realize.  a good plan includes moves in both directions... a bad plan assumes it will just match a pattern.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t4e20d/the_sp500_chart_from_the_crash_in_2008_is_a/hz0yad7/)

[for what it's worth i sold sq for abnb today.  sq has been a long-term hold for me. i've been in it for about 5-6 years now. i started getting bearish on it in early 2020 which is when i began to sell and i'm basically out of the position entirely at this point. i think short-term it's likely to see a bounce as it's been heavily sold this last year, but long-term i'm just not sure you'll see the same kind of growth we've seen in recent years. it's also still quite expensive and a fairly risky stock to own given the competition in the fintech space and among some of their key products. i also don't agree with their recent focus on cypto. it's a good company though... they're doing cool things, but i'm just not as much of a believer as i have been in the past. if you like their products though and believe they have a lot of room for growth then it's not a bad buy here.  i brought abnb because i've used the service for about a decade and have recommended it countless times. i just really like and believe in what the company is doing. i'm not expecting explosive growth which is why i've been waiting for a better entry because it's a very expensive stock, but i think it's a clear long-term winner. again, i guess it depends on how much you believe in the product because it's not cheap. at it's current valuation it really only makes sense if you believe it's going to grow and do well for years to come.](/r/stocks/comments/t4c144/thoughts_on_sq_abnb_se/hyzgnv6/)

[fair points. i agree that se expanding beyond sea is a risky move, since they could've just focused on sea which is still largely untapped. but seeing how well they're doing in brazil might also mean that they have a team that can understand regional consumer patterns well. but yes, if i had a say i would much rather to have them focus on making business in sea profitable first before expanding beyond. but tbh there's really no match. for them in sea, i know people from the region and it's closest competitor lazada is constantly losing market share to them.  on abnb, the brand itself is the moat. people will say let's book an airbnb instead of let's book a homestay, it's just like people tend to say just google it instead of let's search it up on a search engine. as long as the overall user experience improves both for the guest and host, i think they will continue to grow. but yes of course it's not cheap.  on sq, what's wrong with jack dorsey? i have never really dig deep about him besides listening to earnings call. mind elaborating? seems like many people has something against him just like mark zukerberg](/r/stocks/comments/t4c144/thoughts_on_sq_abnb_se/hz0qq9d/)

probably lots of possible avenues. one might be ""i stayed in an apartment with $1k/mo rent rather than buying a house w/ a payment of $2.5k. i took that $1.5k/mo and bought apple stock with it each month. over the course of 10 years, i have $180k principal into this stock, while my house value might drop/same/increase. i couldn't write off my mortgage interest because the standard deduction was more than my interest, so in this case if apple stock did really well, better than my house appreciated &amp; my rent didn't go up to eat that difference, i might be ahead financially.",2,,lottadot,0

1646252805,"apple this morning announced a virtual product launch event to be held on march 8, at 10 a.m. pacific. the invitation headline reads ""peek performance."" 

bloomberg reported last month that the apple (ticker: aapl) march event is likely to feature a new 5g version of the iphone se line of entry-level smartphones, as well an updated ipad air, and the release of version 15.4 of the iphone os. the updated os reportedly will include new emojis, face id support for masks (a little late at this point with mask mandates largely disappearing in most places), and other new features. 

according to various apple rumor sites, the event could feature new macs, including a revised mac mini and potentially a new 13-inch macbook pro. 

what you're not likely to get at this event are the things investors are most jazzed about: virtual reality and augmented reality glasses (widely expected later this year), and the apple car (which may or may not ever happen, but in any case is still a ways off.)

better yet: look at how index funds work...

type 'schb'. click 1 year time window. better yet: click max window.  
type 'gme'. click max window.  

now use your brain. look at gme again. there are just a few periods in time when buying is a good idea. and recently, there are just as many bad times to buy and lose a lot of money. timing is everything with high volatility, overvalued bullshit like gme. now look back to what normal investments are like. ask yourself: when should i invest in an index fund? look at the graph. it doesn't fucking matter. you will always make money over time. no timing. no conspiracy theories. no bullshit.

now look at aapl stock. nothing too special about just apple as a company to pick here. i could pick google. or microsoft. same thing. big companies making big money. you could have done better holding them in the last year than gme. hell, even tesla, as overvalued as it is, is still doing something. but what does gme have? they are a brick and mortar games seller in a games economy rapidly transitioning to all digital. so what do they have? nft? really? come on, y'all know that's bullshit.

what else does gme have? they're the brick and mortar middle man in an increasingly digital economy where the console owners are building their own digital stores and them and the game devs have every incentive in the world to cut people like gme out completely and reduce their business to zero. and not only do they have all the incentive, they have all the leverage and capacity to do exactly that. if xbox decides to go full digital store someday how can gamestop stop them? oops. they can't.

so what then? sell computer parts? worthless nft tokens? memes? fucking bullshit.

there's your dd. use your fucking brains. quit this cult before they bleed you dry. think for yourself. look at the charts again. anyone can make money off an index fund. but for high volatility shit like gme has turned into, some people will make money, but some people will lose money. you have to guess. you have to be lucky, because you're just trading on volatility now. there is no news. no short squeeze. it happened. it's done. because gme isn't generating real value as a company right now to justify this valuation, so it's all just horse trading on dust and echoes. save yourself. think for yourself. don't worry about responding. just think about it. i don't want people to screw themselves. i want people to think and be happy. and i hate having bullshit pollute my frontpage on reddit. that's the only reason i'm writing any of this out.",1,,agnostic_science,0

ryan cohen is/was the largest individual holder (or hodler) of apple stock prior to becoming the man who is also a chair. apple has been playing a distant second fiddle to microsoft for decades on the gaming forefront. this really grind tim cook's gears. gamestop has also been microsoft's primary strategic retail partner for gaming products since the xbox launched roughly 20 years ago. however, gamestop is vendor agnostic, and has sells any and all hardware and software that gamers need. the partnership to continue retailing microsoft's gaming products does not prevent gamestop from selling apple products. you can buy iphones on gamestop's online store. right now.


gmerica will be a platform agnostic nft marketplace that apple &amp; microsoft will both benefit from. bring your own hardware. software products sold on gmerica will delight users of both of these tech giants.

[aapl buybacks alone will be worth 3-4% a year increase. they may not grow as fast as goog but we don’t know what new products they have in store. why i remain bullish is due to the fact that all the teenagers have or want an iphone. horace deidu tweeted that we spend an average of 4 hrs a day on our phones. that number will increase as our analog world starts to blur the line with the digital world. plus iphones and macs still have a minority share in the world.   also, the m1 has been a huge success. when they announced they were designing their own computer chips based on the a1 nearly everyone laughed it off. i thought that it was brilliant because how efficient a1 was. i bought a base macbook air over a year ago and it replaced 3 of my computers. now they are designing their own cell phone chip and everyone is saying good luck. what if they pull it off and create a super efficient arm chip with integrated modem?   i think aapl is a super safe stock that will grow steady. as a shareholder since the original iphone release, naysayers have been saying the same things over and over again. yet here we are at nearly $3 trill market cap. would not surprise me if they grow at 20-25% a year for the next decade.](/r/stocks/comments/t4wlh1/why_still_buy_apple/hz1f0x5/)

1646314885,"the simplest numbers were from pre fomo last year - he announced 4 million investors when the price was dirt cheap - &gt; float / investors =approx 120 shares average to own the float

  


now, since this happened before the price went up, it would've been so easy to accumulate more than that number...

  


here's something i copy paste from a few other people - some from the share vote count, others from separate studies :

  


from the share vote where 1% registered 13% of the float:  
you need to factor in bias towards larger holders being more active but you can conservatively say that there are 2-4 billion shares out there, as of august 9th.  
this also matches the ftds which are thousands of times higher than apple stock (the 2nd most traded during jan-may)  
1.59% of shareholders registered 13.2% of the float.

quote from the least tit jacking mathematical study done:  
can't take a linear average. use bimodal distribution using pareto principal, fit along a burr distribution (used to model us household income), etc. must account for the positive skewness of the distribution.

i ran a one-tail analysis and the result is closer to 1.3b shares, with 99.99% probability (p-value &lt;0.0001).

for the smooth, the total shares that exist is at least 1.3b. could be much, much higher. but 1.3b is the absolute minimum.

apple i think they already starting dealing with the lower income growth issue.  the ipad upgraded last year is actually pretty good for 300 dollars. ipad ecosystem is much better than android, and 300 dollars is affordable enough in my opinion. also, apple plans to release an affordable iphone model within march month pretty soon. those affordable devices do sell well. the cheapest ipad is apples best selling ipad device by far. they wont able to make a big margin on those affordable devices, but the consumer tied to their ecosystem will generate service revenue for apple. i do not own any apple stock directly, but i stand with apple could potential do well during recession.",1,,[deleted],0

i definitely believed it was the future. i believe i 100% would have gone with apple stock if i had money to put in to the market at the time. 

another crazy thing: my dad had a shit ton of stock when he was laid off(a long story of its own). he burned not only his severance but also most of his stock having a year long existential crisis. had he just held on to the stock and moved on to another job quicker, it’s wild to think about what that stock would be worth now.",91,,Uknow_nothing,0
1646326585,"i understand where you're coming from, but i'd like to try and make my case.

i work with emerging markets. in one country (widely considered ""third world"", but is more realistically categorized as emerging), facebook marketplace has blown up. this is a country with 250+ million population, btw. fb marketplace has outpaced more established ecommerce platforms in terms of monthly growth, in the last year alone. the ground sentiment is this: fb has become a 'superapp' for people who want to connect, do business, and reach an audience much wider than they ever thought possible.

no amount of ""but the zuck sucks"", stock price drops, or questionable practices is taking away from the real utility this massive chunk of humanity is getting out of fb.

unlike more established ecommerce companies, marketplace leverages both reach and personal agency. in a massive archipelago where logistics can be difficult for a top-down centralized corporation, fb marketplace serves as a bridge for hundreds of thousands of regular buyers and sellers. commerce is organic, effective, and compatible with how folks here operate. some guy named mark zuckerberg in silicon valley doing unethical shit means nothing to these people.

it gets better. tentpole ecommerce companies are feeling the pinch. they are unable to catch up to the efficacy of 'friend networks'.

sure, meta stock is tanking. as someone who owns meta shares, i feel the pain. but the drop is more indicative of investor confidence (which waxes and wanes with the hype cycle), than it is about future potential. in the part of the world where i work, the potential is untapped, and growing faster than i've ever seen in developed markets.

facebook as a social media platform may have fallen out of favor in the west, but let's remember that instagram has massive cultural sway among the youth... which is owned by facebook! whatsapp is another. it's not a big deal in the us, but in the east, whatsapp literally drives business. i was surprised by the reach of whatsapp when i first moved here, but it has become the defacto mode of communication - and in so many large countries here - a mode of commerce.

millions in the us may one day stick a finger to the zuck and delete their fb accounts, but that's not really going to change anything. asia has the numbers, and now has the money. we're talking tens of millions here. what they want is trade with trusted networks, and facebook/instagram/whatsapp is the informal breadboard on which they do it.

facebook as a brand may not survive in the west, but here, facebook not only will thrive, but is the internet.",3,,230897,0

the tech is still cooking. there's no 'failure' if there's no market yet.

1646330846,"ok fellow nerd, yes i remember the 'tablets' pre-apple; no one used them in their day-to-day. there were no app stores, no unicorn companies built on top of them, or really anything other than novelty. sure, they were fun (and laggy as fuck) to play with whenever you saw one, but they were a gimmick. ipad changed that within a few years of launch, but that was still almost half a decade after this, thus anyone claiming now that ""apple was destined for greatness, anyone who didn't buy apple stock back in early 2009 are suckers"" is a liar.",3,,AshyWings,0

все видели список бизнес-санкций в 2022 году, гуляющий сегодня по всем пабликам, материал взят с вики (к слову, которая вчера получила предупреждение от роскомнадзора о возможной блокировке). давайте разберемся и проверим, что из этого правда, что нет и список я немного дополню:

apple pay и google pay - полный блок (втб, открытие, новикомбанк, промсвязьбанк, совкомбанк, частичная правда, наблюдались проблемы, но оплата у большинства проходит, что будет через месяц неизвестно)

$aapl - полный выход с рынка (недостоверно, но при выборе товара пишет на сайте - магазин apple store в данный момент закрыт)

adidas - отказ от работы со сборной по футболу (также, разрыва контракта не было, но его ""приостановили"")

audi, volkswagen, porsche (ваг груп), volvo, jaguar, mercedes, renault и др. - выходят с рынка (вранье, пока приостановлены отгрузки в связи с невероятными колебаниями валют и невозможностью прогнозировать цены и отгрузить клиентам, которые оплатили свои авто в рублях, но еще не получили, оф. заявлений не было, так сказала тетя из ауди по телефону представительства, в других компаниях очевидно все тоже самое, даже звонить не стал)

$amd - запрет поставки микрочипов и вскоре запрет на поставку видеокарт (так же, приостановили, но громких заявлений не было, как и ясности что будет в будущем)

$amzn - полный блок всего ритейла, на моем аккаунте действительно пропал регион россия и русский язык, заходит почему с доменом германии

adobe - полный блок (вообще не нашел информации про это, сайт работает и продает свои решения)

british petrolium - вышли из роснефти 20% акций (правда, но на 19.75%)

bbc - отзыв лицензий на вещание (не удалось узнать точно, только tass написали об этом, но известно что права по bbc в россии принадлежат яндексу, коль они разорвут контракт уверен попадут на не кислую неустойку)

bmw - закрывает заводы, блокирует поставки (""в связи с текущей геополитической ситуацией мы остановим наше местное производство и экспорт на российский рынок до дальнейшего уведомления"")

bolt - выход с рынка (какой-то эстонский сервис такси, который работал только в питере, вообще не слышал о таком)

$ba - выход с рынка (правда, ""мы приостановили поставки запчастей, техническое обслуживание и техническую поддержку российских авиакомпаний"", - говорится в сообщении компании.

по сообщениям сми, boeing также закрыл свое представительство на украине, приостановил работу московского учебного центра подготовки пилотов.)

chevrolet - выходят с рынка (вообще не нашел информации про это нигде, похоже на вранье)

cannes festival - блокировка рф делегации (даже проверять не стану, ибо мне лично фиолетово)

cadillac - выходят с рынка (не нашел новостей, максимум приостановка отгрузок и не из-за ситуации со спец. операцией, а опять таки из-за курса)

carlsberg - ограничение экспорта (не нашел информации)

cex io - крипто площадка блокирует ру юзеров (в cex io уточнили, что ограничения распространяются исключительно на регистрацию новых пользователей. клиентам из украины с аккаунтами старше двух месяцев, а также клиентам из россии и беларуси с аккаунтами старше четырех месяцев сервис доступен в полном объеме)

$ko - выход с рынка (похоже на чушь, сайт работает, колу можно заказать, в холодильнике она стоит и даже не шипит :))

danone - выход с рынка вместе с дочерней компанией простоквашино - фейк (danone не планирует уходить из рф 30 минут назад на interfax)

$dis - отмена всех фильмов (действительно приостановили, как и показ бэтмена и премьеры какого-то мультика, но отношения целиком ""не порвали"")

dell - выход с рынка (вранье, приостановка и в россии, и на украине)

dropbox - перестанет работать в стране через несколько дней

dhl - выход с рынка (вранье, приостановка, на украине, к слову, тоже)

ebay - полный блок (не могу проверить, нет аккаунта)

eurovision - дисквалификация (правда, но смешная, причем тут вообще казалось бы конкурс песенок? уже даже не скрывают, что это политическое шоу)

1646388595,"дайджест на 02.03.2022 (часть 2, всего их 3)

ericsson - выход с рынка (""ericsson срочно анализирует введенные санкции. компания решила приостановить все поставки клиентам в россии, пока мы проводим анализ"", опять вранье, лишь приостановка)

$xom - отзывают всех специалистов из нефтяных компаний рф (похоже не правду, как и заморозку всех инвестиций и приостановку проекта на сахалине, в твиттере оф. писали о поддержке украины)

$fb - блокировка аккаунтов рф сми (это было и до украины, логично, что в связи с обострением блокировок стало больше, но в целом $fb топит за украину)

ups и fedex - полный запрет поставок (логистические компании временно остановили доставку грузов в россию и на украину из-за военной операции). как по-разному звучит правда? полный запрет и временная приостановка, прямо таки несет пропагандой

formula 1 - отмена турнира в сочи (правда)

ford $f - закрывает все магазины (временная приостановка, тем не менее они собирались уходить еще до кипиша)

fifa - дисквалификация сборной на чм и запрет на проведение любых международных матчей в рф (правда)

$hp - запрет ввоза (также приостановка)

instagram - блокировка пропаганды (будто этого раньше не было, insta под fb лежит и политика там точно такая же)

$intc - запрет поставки микрочипов (приостановка)

lenovo - выход с рынка (приостановка)

linkedin - готовятся к полному выходу из страны (они и так только с vpn работали)

mok - отмена всех соревнований (призвал отменить все соревнования)

$ma mastercard - приостановка производства карт, отключение нескольких банков (речь про swift и попавшие под санкции банки, моя карта отлично работает)

maersk - остановка поставок в/из рф (правда, но только забыли слово ""временная"")

megogo - удаление всех русских фильмов, прекращение вещания федеральных российских каналов, запрет доступа пользователям из россии (фейк, 28 февраля megogo сообщал о «технических проблемах» из-за хакерской атаки. из-за неё не работал раздел с трансляцией телеканалов на территории россии, сайт действительно лежит)",1,,IsceLiashka,0
1646388618,"дайджест на 02.03.2022 (часть 3, всего их 3)

nhl - полная блокировка для игроков из рф (организация приостанавливает сотрудничество с партнерами из россии. также нхл откажется от проведения каких-либо соревнований под своей эгидой на территории рф.)

$nflx netflix - остановка производства рф сериалов, проблемы с оплатой и отказ трансляции ру каналов (правда)

$nke nike - закрывают все магазины (жители россии не смогут заказывать продукцию nike на веб-сайте и в приложении компании. как заявили в компании, это связано с отсутствием гарантии, что товары будут доставлены покупателям. согласно сообщению, появившемуся на сайте фирмы 1 марта, решение является временным. как долго оно будет действовать — не уточняется, однако магазины работают)

nestle - закрывает все 6 фабрик в рф (вранье, склады и производство закрыты только на украине)

parimatch - отозвали франшизу (это правда, права принадлежат украине, текущие владельцы бизнеса в россии обещают ребрендинг просто провести :))

$snap snapchat - блокировка в рф и беларуси (правда, написали в своем аккаунте, что поддерживают украину, правда не понятно ушли сами или их роскомнадзор ушел)

shell - разрыв контракта с газпромом (правда, shell решила продать долю в сп с «газпромом» — спг-заводе «сахалин-2» и газопроводе «северный поток-2»)

$twtr twitter - нельзя регистрировать аккаунты гражданам рф (под старым все замечательно, если кто-то может проверить или подтвердить/опровергнуть информацию, напишите в комменты пожалуйста)

tiktok - массовая блокировка агрессивных пользователей и сми (как это было всегда собственно)

$tsm - остановка продажи полупроводников и изготовления наших эльбрусов (правда)

$v visa - блокировка банкам под санкциями (правда)

$yndx - исключение акций компании с котировок на ny бирже (фейк, приостановка торгов акциями российских компаний носит ""временный характер"" и вызвана антироссийскими санкциями сша, введенными в связи с событиями на украине. по сведениям источников ""уолл-стрит джорнэл"", их делистинг на данный момент не рассматривается, специалисты nyse и nasdaq продолжают изучать ограничительные меры, введенные вашингтоном.

youtube - блокировка некоторых рф каналов и их монетизации (блокировки некоторых рф каналов были всегда, так что это вообще бред какой-то)

вывод: (из тех, что проверил я) больше половины - полное вранье. коммерческие структуры не могут нормально работать:
1) из-за курса (который действительно показывает чудеса)
2) из-за отсутствия понимания что будет дальше (в плане новых ограничений) и как адаптироваться к текущим уже введенным санкциям с обеих сторон
3) приостановки в большинстве своем носят обоюдный характер и касаются не только россии, но и украины, коммерция умеет считать деньги и риски и рисковать и терять деньги никто не хочет

да, мы действительно не знаем, что будет дальше, возможно за приостановкой последует полное прекращение деятельности или же наоборот возобновление, но пока нагнетать рано и нужно писать о том, что имеем на данный момент.

все эти громкие заголовки форсят в основном проукраинские группы ""вышла из россии"", но по факту почти везде на данный момент только приостановки за редким исключением. не удивлен собственно почему википедию собираются ""роскомнадзорнуть"".

yes. but i still prefer with motion controls, certainly cyberpunk which is a fps and i'd very much want to have a gun in my hands for real aiming. hzd is fast-paced action made for gamepad and third-person and that simply wouldn't translate that great to a full vr experience - which is exactly why sony is creating its own offspring for psvr2. but yeah, i'd still very much would prefer to play hzd, tw3 or elden ring in vr, to be right there in those worlds along with those characters, even if limited to gamepad... that's i think what sony is going after with their hybrid approach for psvr2. so there's never a lack of big content for vr.

that said, lack of content has always been an issue, but i've never seen it this low regardless.  r/psvr before quest released used to have about 2k users online, then r/oculusquest took that mark from them. now they're all going dead, big releases like vox machinae or ultrawings 2 on quest are getting ridiculously low ratings for the good content they bring. it's like the hype machine meta was driving with the metaverse promises was seriously hurt by awful media coverage and meta stock going down hard and suddenly everyone left the metaverse building... it's just weird af like i've never seen before in my 4 years into vr...",1,,Namekuseijon,0

[amc is a two dollar stock factoring the massive debt compared to revenues/net income. this isn't like buying crypto or futures where the value is purely based upon demand. amc is an actual company that has to balance its spreadsheets and avoid bankruptcy (it's not a dividend stock, so delivering profit to investors is not on the agenda. that's why the officers sell and dilute). if it can't do that, it issues more shares to finance more bad business paid for by the investors trying to pump and dump and failing company... which can't be significantly pumped because too much of the float can't be delivered due to overbuying from the original pump. tldr this can't be pumped again until it hits sub $5/share. sell while you still can and invest in companies that actually make money and allow amc to build up short interest/ available shares.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t4ljrd/amc_90_float_owned_by_retail/hz2duoc/)

[aapl buybacks alone will be worth 3-4% a year increase. they may not grow as fast as goog but we don’t know what new products they have in store. why i remain bullish is due to the fact that all the teenagers have or want an iphone. horace deidu tweeted that we spend an average of 4 hrs a day on our phones. that number will increase as our analog world starts to blur the line with the digital world. plus iphones and macs still have a minority share in the world.   also, the m1 has been a huge success. when they announced they were designing their own computer chips based on the a1 nearly everyone laughed it off. i thought that it was brilliant because how efficient a1 was. i bought a base macbook air over a year ago and it replaced 3 of my computers. now they are designing their own cell phone chip and everyone is saying good luck. what if they pull it off and create a super efficient arm chip with integrated modem?   i think aapl is a super safe stock that will grow steady. as a shareholder since the original iphone release, naysayers have been saying the same things over and over again. yet here we are at nearly $3 trill market cap. would not surprise me if they grow at 20-25% a year for the next decade.](/r/stocks/comments/t4wlh1/why_still_buy_apple/hz1f0x5/)

[what bookstores can currently compete with amazon? i’m not making some outrageous claim here. borders is out of business, barnes and noble is in a downward trajectory, and the mom and pop shop is effectively dead with exception of some holdouts that can’t impact amazon’s market share.  the intention was to drive remaining competitors out of business and they succeeded. how is that not a win? there is nothing left for them to do in the book market.   same with malls. you can have an opinion that spg can repurpose their buildings and breathe new life in to them, but it’s hard to argue that malls aren’t dead/dying. the data is pretty apparent both in revenue declines but also anecdotally. any mall i’ve visited recently has probably only 50% occupancy and no traffic. spg just opened a new one in my metro area and they literally can’t even get any food vendors to sign. the food court has been empty for over a year. i’d be interested in hearing your mall thesis if you have one though](/r/stocks/comments/t5q216/amazon_closing_physical_stores_cannot_be_all/hz6n6o4/)

[i think the main value of brk is in non listed holdings. it is a bit booring portfolio for sure, but who needs extra excitement these days..  i view it is as more of an etf. though aapl share of the portfolio is way too much, but that's only because it has appreciated so much since the position was taken.  i don't think ""buffet premium"" acctually exists nowadays, and i expect no lasting effect on share price after they are no more in charge. they are old men and while their insight is still appreciated, their reputation isn't anymore at the same level it used to be 10 to 15 years ago.](/r/stocks/comments/t4we8e/is_investing_in_berkshire_hathaway_a_good_idea/hz149ft/)

[aapl buybacks alone will be worth 3-4% a year increase. they may not grow as fast as goog but we don’t know what new products they have in store. why i remain bullish is due to the fact that all the teenagers have or want an iphone. horace deidu tweeted that we spend an average of 4 hrs a day on our phones. that number will increase as our analog world starts to blur the line with the digital world. plus iphones and macs still have a minority share in the world.   also, the m1 has been a huge success. when they announced they were designing their own computer chips based on the a1 nearly everyone laughed it off. i thought that it was brilliant because how efficient a1 was. i bought a base macbook air over a year ago and it replaced 3 of my computers. now they are designing their own cell phone chip and everyone is saying good luck. what if they pull it off and create a super efficient arm chip with integrated modem?   i think aapl is a super safe stock that will grow steady. as a shareholder since the original iphone release, naysayers have been saying the same things over and over again. yet here we are at nearly $3 trill market cap. would not surprise me if they grow at 20-25% a year for the next decade.](/r/stocks/comments/t4wlh1/why_still_buy_apple/hz1f0x5/)

1646407140,"what's wrong with your analysis?  too many assumptions. 

1. assuming current burn rate is linear.  it's not.  we have no way of knowing.  costs could be just for some inventory or expenditures that quarter and don't translate to the next.  things like the consignment deal, while reducing revenue (as you point out), will also reduce cost.  so it's not linear.
2. the 350m eloc will give them at least two years of run time in their new facility.  so from june 2022 to june 2024.  every growth stock needs a second (and third, fourth, even) offering.  you want to take on additional capital strategically as you grow.  it's impossible to scale a business without it.  all other spacs will eventually have to go through this same problem.  rmo is way ahead of many other spacs in terms of what business phase they are at.  they have running assembly lines now, a product now, and are moving to the automated cypress facility this summer.
3. this is a growth stock.  it's a risk like all growth stocks are.  is it worth a stock price of 38?  god no.  is it worth 1.40 to take a risk on a growth stock.  possibly.  people buy growth stocks to hit home runs.  there will be consolidation in this space.  rmo has good patents that someone will buy....at what price?  who knows?  but they have a great product and batteries are in short supply across all industries.  demand for them will be high in general. losing bw allows them to pursue all battery spaces, not just commercial vehicle.  will it be successful transitioning from great design/product to great manufacturing and business ops?  that's the risk of growth stock.  
4. this is not going to happen overnight.  like at akasol and how their stock price stayed low for many years before spiking to 120 on their borgwarner buyout in 2021. everyone who stuck with akasol got rich.  they hit the homerun.  if you want the sure thing, just buy microsoft stock and call it a day.  it will slowly grow steadily over time with no risk.
5. revenue, like cost, is also not fixed.  what you need to know is the delta between the 40-50m and the new lowered costs after they move into cypress this summer and switch to the consignment model.  there is no way to know that.  if you want to add 350m plus the 95m they have on hand, that's 445m.  losing 90m a year would give them 5 more years to turn profit assuming they could not get more capital. even then, they could still take a buyout.  would that buyout be worth more than a stock price of 1.40? 
6. there is nothing ""rosy"" about growth stocks ever.  they are a risk.  you have to see the future.  tesla isn't making profits without credits.  it can take years to turn profits.  but batteries will be needed in every sector and are in short supply.

the problem to me is that the scarcity just isn’t real. even if you artificially create limitations like in second life, as soon as the price gets too high people will just go elsewhere because the switching cost is zero, unlike actual real estate or possessions. 

i do believe the meta verse will be a big deal. i’m skeptical there are ways to invest in it other than buying meta stock or angel investing in tech. 

whenever you see anything related that’s supposedly a crypto innovation, the question you have to ask is “why does this need to be decentralized?” bitcoin, which tries to be digital cash, has excellent answers to that question. scarcity is not the innovation with crypto, that can be created by anyone with a server that knows how to count. decentralized scarcity is uniquely suited to digital cash, and digital, decentralized cash is useful when you distrust your government etc. smart contracts have potential too, but again there has to be value in decentralization, otherwise it’s just software that could be built in any technology.

this, imo, is why crypto has had trouble demonstrating serious real world value beyond being digital cash. i wouldn’t go near nfts in the meta verse.",3,,kittenbomber,0

if the question you're asking is just ""what python program does my professor want me to write"" then the answer seems to be contained in the assignment: they want you to iterate over a csv file of aapl's closing stock price, and feed that into an algorithm that compares the closing price to the 5-day average and says ""buy"" if the closing price is 98% of the average price or lower, and ""sell"" if you own some and the closing price is 102% of the average price or higher, then note the profit you'd make and add that to a total. note the important constraint that comes in from the fact that we're talking about a *market*, so you can't sell before you buy.

contained in here as well is the assumption that you're either holding a single stock or none at all; since you're not given any kind of budget, i think it's fair to say that once you buy the single aapl stock, you're in ""hold or sell"" mode until the price goes up sufficiently to cause you to sell your single stock. in other words not only can you not sell before you buy, you can't buy after you buy until you sell. if the intent was that you would own more than one share at a time, you'd be told to accept ""budget"" or something as a parameter (to reflect that you don't have infinite money to invest in aapl stock.)

does that make it any clearer? one way to proceed in these programming problems is to identify constraints - ""what things can't be true in my program? what states do i have to disallow?"" one of those states is being in the state of trying to sell stock that you haven't bought yet, as i've described.",3,,crashfrog,0

1646491399,"well pre-pandemic/price increases, paying 50-100 bucks more for an aftermarket card was the norm.

people would pay 50 more dollars for a non-reference evga, for example. thats basically what your doing now on a card like this. i think what people are wanting, is the card manufacturers to eat some of the tariff cost, but right now they simply dont have to. the demand is too high.

and i agree. im not for sure if they get more expensive, but they definitely arent going down to pre-pandemic prices anytime soon, either. that ship has sailed for a very long time. it may be multiple generations of cards before that happens, and even then, there is going to be a new norm set regardless.

it sucks, but people just have to erase those pre-covid prices from their brains; they arent coming back. by the time the market stabilizes to even allow such a thing, if it even does, they wont be that cheap ever again.

if people want those prices, they better start driving to best buys that do restocks and try to get one like that. unfortunately for me, i think i only live near 1 best buy, maybe 2, both 1.5 hours away, that even has the nvidia stock come in. but to me thats just not worth the hassle. just accept the world the way it is, and stop suffering. get a card near the ""new mrsp"" with tariffs plus a small aib markup, and call it a day.

$goog is near its lowest pe ratio in a decade plus.  $aapl's last 4 quarters have $378b in revenue.  $amzn has doubled revenue since 2018, should hit $500b annual by 2023.

these aren't the companies from 1999.  these companies absolutely run the world.  they aren't flying because of their ""potential"", they're flying because they absolutely demolish earnings each and every quarter.

they've benefited from network effects and economies of scale.  the only risk to their business model is regulation.  there will be no real crash without big tech joining the party, and that will require a major economic downturn.

the companies with stupid multiples and perennial losses have already been destroyed.  many companies are down 70-80%.  these are still much more robust and real businesses than the shit we saw in 1999.

vitalik's 32 eth are not making the network ""more secure"" than someone's 32 eth that only have a cursory understanding, once they're both staked. there are basic talking points hidden in there that deserve some nuanced thought(client diversity etc.) but in my estimation it's a large leap in logic to assert that every single person learning linux to stake, somehow ""secures"" the network more. p.s: in your opinion, would a ""push button"" staking service be better or worse than someone staking 32 eth on cex?",7,,Doje_a_vu,0

1646595596,"i would buy now. here are my counter-arguments to everyone else’s arguments:

”don’t catch a falling knife”: this is common advice and i normally agree with it. if apple stock just got hit 7%, you don’t want to buy in until you’re sure it’s not going to go down 11% before rebounding. it’s ok to wait for things to level out. but houses are different. if you want this house for the long term, you’re only “catching a falling knife” if prices utterly collapse and stay there.

if your horizon is 5-10 years or longer, rather than 1-2 years, the chances of staying underwater are basically zero. maybe the world gets nuked, maybe some really crazy stuff happens, but the market has never ended up lower over a ten year run.

”go travel!”: what would probably happen is you’d have a great time but then when you return prices would be higher than when you left. which would be a bummer.

”wait several months”: i don’t disagree with this. nothing wrong with waiting. you’re taking a small gamble that things aren’t going to suddenly reverse in the next few months. you’ll have more information, and more information is good.

but the counter-argument, and the one i’d make, is that people are currently freaking out. freaking out is great. warren buffet says you should buy when everyone is fearful and sell when everyone is greedy. if you buy a house right now, you’ll be able to drive a hard bargain. maybe that won’t be the case in a few months as people recalibrate their expectations.

1646637975,"you do not understand the land value tax. 100% lvt means 100% of the annual land value, not 100% of the land price.

you need to understand a few things:

1. land price changes in response to increased taxes on land value
2. land value (as in land rent) does not change in response to increased taxes on land value.

here's a mathematical example:

suppose a piece of land has an annual rental value of $v/year and maybe some costs $c/year (like hiring an accountant, fulfilling landlord duties, *or taxes*). suppose there is no inflation, but you discount future profit at 100d% per year.

what is the minimum you'd pay for this land just to rent it out?

well,

(v-c)+(v-c)\*(1-d)+(v-c)\*(1-d)^(2)+....=(v-c)/d=p(v,c,d)

so you can check that with land value v=$40,000, c=0, and d=5% we have that the land price is $800,000. 

now suppose we have a tax revenue stream based on the price of the land. so the tax is a function of the price, t(p). the important thing is that the land price is a function of this tax itself since the tax is a cost. we can write, c=t(p). so we have, to solve for p(v,t(p),d) this recursive definition is fine. lets say the tax rate is 100t\% of the land price. so t=p(v,t(p),d)\*t. for brevity, i'll just write c=t=pt.

because you're also paying a tax every year, you also have to subtract the tax in the price equation above so we have,

we now get, 

(v-pt)+(v-pt)\*(1-d)+(v-pt)\*(1-d)^(2)+....=(v-pt)/d=p

rearranging gives:

p+pt/d=p(1+t/d)=p(t+d)/d=v/d

finally, p=v/(t+d). annual tax revenue is t=pt=vt/(t+d)

so you can check that with land value v=$40,000, t=1%, and d=5% we have that the land price is $666,667, and the annual tax is $6,667. not $8,000 which was 1% of $800,000.
 
on the other we can have a tax revenue stream based on the value of the land. we can write, c=vy, where y is the percentage of the annual land value taxed. in a similar fashion we find that.

(v-vy)/d=p

with y=1, the land price is zero. 

if you want to relate the tax on annual value to the annual tax of price, you have,

vy=vt/(t+d) or y=t/(t+d)

some interesting benchmarks are,

1. taxing land price 0% is equivalent to taxing land value 0%
2. taxing land value 100% is equivalent to taxing land price infinite percent (since the land price goes to zero).
3. taxing land price 100% is equivalent to taxing land value 1/(1+d) percent which is really, really close to 1 for small discount rates. 
4. taxing land price at 1-d is equivalent to taxing land value at 1-d.
5. taxing land price at d taxes 50% of land value.

personally, the lower limit of land value tax which i'd be okay with is the discount rate. but i would not accept the definition of the discount rate as the interest rate. i'd prefer the time preference model of temporal discounting.",2,,MATHECONAFM,0

1646654240,"legally, insider trading is trading based on knowledge of a company's internal non public knowledge. for example, if you are a research scientist as a drug company, and you are incharge of the drug trial on a new cancer drug, and are writing the report, you know before anyone else if the drug is going to be safe and effective. itnis a crime for you to buy and sell company stock based on that knowledge.

the us government isn't legally a company, so insider trading laws don't apply to its actions, so a senator involved in writing bills that will affect an industry can legally buy and sell stocks based in that information, before the bill even makes it out of the negotiating chamber.

1646737896,"ah, i think i see what you’re saying. that gambling has a clearly defined winner and loser

i do think it’s more nuanced than that, however, because in the car/driving scenario we can both be winning against the odds (of whatever minuscule risk exposure) but somewhere out there, people are crashing every 60 seconds. supposedly every 16 minutes a car accident happens that results in death. statistically, people will get in a car accident every 18 years. 

you and i may be “winning” against the risk but a lot of people lose to the odds by just driving a car

additionally, people (rarely) can beat the odds in the stock market- the holding firm berkshire hathaway has averaged a 20% return for the past 55 years, doubling the market average for longer than i’ve been alive

while many more succumb to the odds

what about an f1 driver, or- competitive sports? couldn’t it be said that when a kid wants to play in the nfl, they’re betting that they can beat the odds and outperform the others? if they win, they can play nfl, statistically they’ll likely lose to the odds and someone else will win. yet when a kid says they want to play pro sports, i haven’t heard anyone say “that’s gambling. statistically you’ll lose.” most people just kind of smile and nod, lol

i’m just saying, in the grand scheme of things, people are exposing themselves to risk and beating odds (or losing to the odds) every day, but when a dollar is involved suddenly their ability to identify risk is heightened and they call it gambling. joining the infantry to engage in firefights where one side lives and one side dies? that’s not betting, or gambling. but- you bought microsoft stock with money? “be careful, you’re exposing yourself to risk”

yes - if you are long those securities, you would be using margin since you have no cash, you would be charged daily margin interest regardless of whether the securities are marginable or not. and your non-margin bp and margin bp would be decreased.

you mean like beanie babies? what happens when you want to purchase something? are you using bitcoin to pay for your gas and groceries? how about your taxes or your phone bill? two people can agree on the value of something, the problem is when that value fluctuates hundreds (or thousands) of dollars a day, nobody is going to want to spend any of said pseudocurrency on a loaf of bread or their netflix subscription. you’re trading pokémon cards that somehow do even less than actual pokémon cards.

“what’s the point of your apple stock if not to sell to a greater fool?”

apple is a company that designs, produces, and sells products used by the consuming public. a share in apple is owning a very, very small piece of aforementioned profitable business. as innovation, then production, then sales progress, apple’s “owners” get to profit when they decide to sell to the next investor looking to fund and profit off of said productive growth. look up “compound interest” and “what’s the average rate of return for the s&amp;p500?”, then take a look at the s&amp;p’s historical data if you’d like a better understanding of the long-term effects of investing in entities that have what’s referred to as “intrinsic value” (which can be used to describe anything from blue text that all the teenagers like seeing when they text each other to superior proprietary software that helps design the world’s best fighter jets to a world-famous red-and-white cursive logo on the side of a soda bottle that consumers have been exposed to since they were babies).

oh-apple also pays investors cash dividends along the way as a reward for giving them the capital they need to create, market, and sell their next iphone and $800 tv stand.

does bitcoin do any of the above? or is it-again-a currency that nobody *uses* as a currency, and instead just gets bought and “hodld” in the hopes some greater fool will purchase said useless token for a higher sum if the original purchaser just waits long enough? eventually, you’re going to run out of greater fools.",4,,TLMSR,0

1646773828,"chen didn’t turn any ship around, the company is now worth exactly the same as when he took over almost a decade ago, so if you add inflation on this scenario, investors lost money during chen period. and put on top the opportunity cost and you will be surprised that 10k in apple stock or some other “boring” blue chip would have returned a hell more.

what people seems to ignore is that humans tend to overestimate their skills by a crazy lot. also, a lot of people have almost a need to prove others wrong. 
think about this: why chen, already “retired”, already rich af, would take a ceo position in a near bankrupt company? 

he doesn’t have to prove anything to anyone, but he most likely overestimated his own capacity on turning things around, and now because of his “clean-slate / reputation” past, he insists in continuing in this position because in his mind he will be successful at the end. 

and of course, i’m not wishing that he fails whatsoever, i have shares on this and would be awesome if we would be looking at bb worth tens of billions.

my point in summary: chen is there for almost a decade, and while he had a nice idea of turning the portfolio into software/etc., he lacks the execution/communication capabilities, but he’s too attached into proving people wrong while the ship is sinking.",3,,NefariousnessNo5717,0

basically all i've been doing is setting a buy limit for some really low price.  maybe it won't hit that day, but during the week there will just be one random spike downward that catches the limit price.  then i just sell for very slightly above market price.  i've been doing this for like 3 weeks and it hasn't failed me yet (knock on wood).

1646835880,"a peg of 1.5 implies a pe ratio of 15 which using today's metrics would mean apple would need to be $90.

if you're waiting for a pe ratio of 15, either:

1. apple will need to raise their earnings per share by a monstrous amount

2. apple stock needs to fall to roughly $90

i can virtually guarantee you that apple will not go back to $90 from current prices. the last sizable drop in apple was about 30% from peak which happened in 2018. 30% from this recent peak would put us at $122.

and apple growing their profits from here to the tune of what you're asking to bring the pe ratio down to 15 is equally as insane in the short term. they might get there in a couple years but definitely not for a few quarters. and even if they get there in a couple of years, the stock will have gone handedly higher by then.

tldr: you're not going to buy apple ever if you're waiting for the pe ratio to be 15",2,,banditcleaner2,0

edit to say:  if you meant ""they"" as in vanguard/blackrock, we totally agree.  if you were talking about the founders, it's important for a lot of these things to separate ""control"" (ie voting rights associated with stock ownership) with ""% equity"" (ie amount of the company you own as a percentage of total shares).  finance is weird and complicated and it's a big part of why videos like the one above oversimplify and miss huge chunks of nuance that are vital to understanding how things are run.",2,,AkbarTheGray,0

but do you not know why amzn dropped 80% between 1999 and 2001?

your statement is a false because you are attempted to correlate a stock split of amazon in 1999 to a 80% drop which is absolutely not why the stock dropped. you could say the same thing about $msft, $aapl in 1999 and 2000 when they had a stock splits.

are you familiar with what happened in 1999 and 2000?

there are also many more recent counter-examples - from $aapl, $amd, $nvda, $tsla.

and no - i never implied that someone shouldn't buy puts on a stock split. buying puts simply because of a stock split is a speculative trade - if you want to make a thesis based on that sort of trade - you are welcome to do so. but using an example which is clearly false is not appreciated. and it creates misinformation.

it's the same sort of comments that people make about buying calls or puts before earnings without understanding option dynamics like volatility crush.

1646942354,"weddings are expensive.. it's a business.  all the girls are programmed to dream about ""my"" wedding day. and it's a ""once in a lifetime""experience.  there are few sectors that they know they got you by the balls.  edudcation, health, car (mobility) 

&amp;#x200b;

1. talk to your partner, parents. don't do this alone.  you are going to be a new family right? you need to handle this together.  doing shit alone is poor people habit. work together. ""not doing anything feels wrong, but doing it too much feel like a waste. how do we find the middle ground?""  some people skip traditional wedding or have smaller one... and use the fund towards trips, houses, car.... it's your life, your money.  don't buy into you have to have it.   talk to your husband and your family.  i'm just guy on the internet.  this is oppotunity to collaborate not get stressed out. 

2. one of my friends had a small wedding on a backyard. one of their friend became a pastor for the wedding... afterward they rent out a bar.. and had a small party... if you really thing about what a wedding is..... 50 100 years ago... they didn't do fancy wedding venues and ""freash flowers"" on every table... that bull shit came later.  it's about union, two familys coming together, starting a life.... you can celerbrate that.

&amp;#x200b;

3. oppotunity cost - is economics concept.  if you buy a iphone for $1000.00. that means you are giving up the oppotunity to buy apple stock for $1000.00    

step 1.  list everything you want in your wedding. list all of them. like the dream wedding. 

step 2.  order the #1 list in priority.   for example.  if dad walking down the road is importatn to you list is as #1.        if riding a horse for a photo is not... list it as... number #49 

step 3. come up with budget. 

step 4.  look at the ordered list from #2      using budget, you are now trying to fulfil list from top to botom.   do not work on wishlist #34 if your top wishes are not met.

&amp;#x200b;

4. rituals matters... 

human kinds... we need orders.  these rituals does matter.. graduation, becoming a adult.., man going to army... ( boy to man ).    wedding walking symbolizes that your health and safety were under the care of your dad. now he is passing the responsibility to your husband.

living life matters too but rituals matter too find balance..   if your husband already has another kid and if you are wiling to marry him and help him raise his kid, he should know he is lucky. and if he knows how valuable you are.. .this wedding ritual should have some weight. 

i would not skip everything.

1646947550,"good question. compound interest isn't an investment product, it's a concept. if you invest $100 in an opportunity that gives you 5% returns every year, then after one year how much do you have? you have $105.

then after the second year, you get 5% again, but this time, you don't have $110 after that second year, you have $110.25, because you earned 5% on that original $100, plus another 5% on the $5 you earned.

see? the interest is compounding because you're earning interest on top of interest you already earned.

now, an index fund, is a term used when referring to a certain kind of investment, usually it is a type of ""mutual fund"" or an ""etf"" (for all intents and purposes, an etf is pretty much the same as a mutual fund). a mutual fund or an etf is a package of stocks from different companies, that you can invest in (buy pieces of). so instead of buying a stock of apple or google, you can invest in a mutual fund that tracks the s&amp;p 500. that means that a financial services company, like jp morgan, vanguard, fidelity, charles schwab, etc. has bundled together thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of stocks of the top 500 companies in the us stock market.

that mutual fund, that tracks the s&amp;p is what's called an index fund. because it tracks a particular metric, or ""index"". there are all kinds of index funds. there are index funds that track the s&amp;p 500, there are index funds that track particular sectors, like real estate, energy, security and defense, etc. there are even index funds that track the entire us stock market.

by investing in an index fund, you protect yourself from the risks of investing in a single company. if you invest in apple, and then for whatever reason apple stock tanks, you lose all your money, but if you invest in hundreds of different companies all at once, then if one stock tanks, the other 499 protect it. and since the us economy is so strong, and grows over time, you are 100% guaranteed to earn a profit over the long run.

now if you're 60 years old, and you want to retire in 5 years, then investing in the stock market isn't a great idea, because if you do, and then the economy dips a bit, or something like covid hits, then you lose a bunch of money. but if you're young then it's worth it because over time, in the long run, you'll earn your money no problem.

if you are thinking about retiring in 37 years, then i would assume you're approximately  28 years old. so you should be investing in your 401k (a minimum of whatever your employer matches) and you should set your 401k investments to track the s&amp;p500, and the total us stock market. that will put your exposure to over 80% stocks and less than 20% bonds. you can also invest in a ""target settlement fund"" and pick a fund with a settlement date to be whatever year you plan on retiring. and as your 401k accrues interest thanks to the economy recovering and growing, that money you earn in interest, also accrues more interest. that's what compounding interest is...

check this link out: [compounding interest calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)

if you start with $5000, and you invest $100 every month for the next 37 years into the s&amp;p 500 (which has an annual return of around 7%) then all you did was invest less than $50k of your own money, but you end up with just over $250k! when you retire that's a 5 to 1 return and it doesn't account for things like raises, and bonuses, or your employer match, or anything like that.

1646948614,"&gt;i think you haven’t realized that you stumbled into the problem. if apple is doing bad, they won’t own apple stock, then apple stock goes down. to stop the fiscal collapse of the company, apple has to resort to evil means. blackrock doesn’t even need to tell apple to do evil because the system will punish apple if they did anything different.

i want to make sure you understand that blackrock has no skin in the game. they have no benefits to ownership of the shares they own—they are passed through to you and me as shareholders of blackrock s&amp;p 500 index fund. blackrock’s ownership is simply our ownership as retail investors. a good analogy would be blackrock is a member of the house of representatives on behalf of us “citizens” of their mutual fund. 

now to your point—aapl certainly wants to be included in that blackrock fund, and in that sense, blackrock does have some input. but, there are three things that keep unbridled greed in check here. 

1. blackrock’s ownership is just our ownership, so if there is a company you don’t like that’s in that fund, you can vote with your dollars and go to a different one. this is the whole thesis behind esg or anti-sin stock fund investing. 

2. long-term returns are predicated on proper resource stewardship and fair worker treatment. this is why esg investing has become so popular. doing the right thing is actually a good screen for sustainable returns, therefore those companies generate more investment. go out to any public company’s investor relations website today and you’ll see an esg statement or report. they do these things because it attracts investors. 

3. nobody controls a majority position, so no one shareholder has overarching say in what happens. this is a good thing, as one of these “evil” people can’t just make the company do what they want. each shareholder has a little bit of power that can be exerted together if something truly stupid was about to be done as a company. this can’t be said of a private company. 

&gt;you are literally saying investment bank don’t care if stocks go up lmao

i said no such thing, please don’t straw man me. i simply said blackrock has no financial interest themselves in apple. all of their shares are passed through to retail investors.",4,,herefortheecho,0

1646954017,"if it is a brand new project then the liquidity might be very very low.

i'll try to explain.   in a freely traded market, e.g. nyse, the greater the volume of trades the narrower the bid/ask spread.  apple stock has some of the narrowest spreads on the market so you may have very little slippage. a thinly traded stock will have wide bid/ask spreads and large slippage.   why is that?   because in a high volume market a market maker can buy/sell rapidly and avoid being stuck with shares that cannot be sold if the market moves against them.

the crypto market behaves similarly.   instead of market makers like the stock market crypto has liquidity pools. liquidity pools act as the counterparty to all trades.  the pool has risk associated with the market moving rapidly just as the stock exchange market makers do and set their slippage (bid/ask spreads) according to volume of trades also.

if you are trading brand new projects it is likely that the liquidity in the pool hasn't had time to build to any significant tvl so the slippage (bid/ask) will be wide enough to walk through.

it's always something.",2,,sagaciousmarketeer,0

1646955797,"man you’re kinda not smart.

let me explain. first, $baba is not a holding company at all. they have no true assets, just an agreement contract. whereas an etf has direct ownership of the underlying shares held by their custodian. so you, the owner on record of that etf, owns the underlying shares held with the custodian. an etf is just the ownership claim that is tradeable on the market.

when you buy $baba. you buy an adr, a form of receipt for a cayman island company called alibaba. this company has a contract (keyword contract) with mainland alibaba to share in the profits. you do not have direct ownership to/or claims to mainland alibaba (true alibaba). this is different from you owning $aapl. you have a us court system enforcing that claim of equity ownership.

this is why the adr, of a company with a vie agreement with mainland alibaba can go to $0. ie $baba. because of claimant issues and non direct ownership, this is the reason why this “stock” is so cheap.

because if china decides to fuck around and get sanctioned. they retaliate by invalidating all vie contracts and “poof” goes your $baba value and that “profit sharing” vie agreement between the two entities (cayman island baba and real mainland baba). and everyone takes an l.

sort of like how some american companies taking an l in russia, because their claim to assets in russia just went “poof”.",18,,gqreader,0

""gf, i appreciate your input, but as i told you before, i will only implement decisions i like. ""  and lets be real - she may not feel welcome.  there's nothing you can really do to change that if you insist on maintaining the exact stance you've mentioned in this post.

giving you the benefit of the doubt- i see how you are viewing this as only your investment.  maybe in the same way you could invest 100k in apple stock.   or in the way a single person would buy their first home and get to have full say and control and answer to no one.   but the issue with this perspective is that you actually want her to live with you (i think).     if you want her to live with you - your going to have to allow her to feel at home in her home and by home i meant where she sleeps.

in your current housing situation, i'm sure she considers it your (joint) home. it doesn't matter that the apartment or property is owned by whoever/whatever llc.  the home is still your joint home. she feels comfortable there.

**i think if you truly want this house to be only an investment, you should continue to live in your current apartment/housing situation with your gf - where its a joint home and you should rent out your new house so as to have that personal investment you want.**      no sane person would want to move in with the parameters and vibe your giving off. don't believe me? read her this post.  i am sure your girlfriend is acting the way she is because she doesn't actually believe what your saying/ it doesn't make sense to her.   the only way your going to get her to understand, is by basically wording things the way you did in this post.  point blank. not mean, just your honest position.",2,,Stressedafhere,0

say i buy 1 share of $aapl. this share is now in my brokerage account, hence i am long $aapl 1 share. let's assume this share is worth $100 at the time.   


now my broker decides to lend out this share. when signing up for a brokerage account, you agree with their tos and this usually includes them lending out your shares.  


this means my broker (party b) lends this share out to someone else (party c). now party c has a contractual obligation to return my share to party b. they also have to pay a fee for borrowing this share. let's assume this fee is 1% now.  


however this means that party c now has a share of $aapl. they decide to sell this share to another person , party d.  


now we have the following situation:  


person a: long 1 $aapl

person b: gets paid for lending out the stock (1$ in this hypothetical case)

there are two possibilities here.1.) the brokerage (b) recalls the share that they lent out and then sells them for you2.) the brokerage sells the shares of another shareholder (e), who is also long $aapl. this does however require this shareholder e to exist.

usually the 2nd option is what happens, but brokerages are always allowed to recall shares that they lent out at any point in time  


your scenario where they would just give money is very unlikely to occur. as in that case the brokerage will be long a share $aapl as soon as the lender returns the stock which is not how brokers work. the securities they hold are not theirs, but their clients.

this is a common misunderstanding.

you'll note that on any list of berkshire's holdings where apple makes up 40%, there is no mention of bnsf, geico, dairy queen, or any of their other wholly owned subsidiaries. 

apple doesn't even make up a particularly large part of berkshires earnings every year (of $90b at brk, only ~$6b is from apple). and the value of their ownership in apple isn't even that large compared to berkshires annual earnings. if apple disappeared tomorrow, berkshires 2020 earnings would pay off the value of apple stock in &lt;2 years.",21,,pitterpattergedader,0

had the person been good on the stock market and picked apple stock, they would be looking at $54,600,000

had they picked say disney you have 2 million in cash. 

tesla $65,625,000 with the money sitting in a bank account for 10 years before being invested!!!

most casual investors big name companies like banks td bank would have netted them 1.2 million plus dividends which would add like another .6 million

the same can be said in reverse, had they picked a loser like black berry and held they would have 350,000 now :p

1647042075,"you don't need to lose your unvested stock's value.

when you move to a new company, you should try to make sure you get a bump in total compensation. that includes unvested stock.  for ten years i stayed at microsoft because i didn't want to lose unvested stock. then a friend told me you can just ask the next company to match it.

i interviewed at amazon. they made an offer and included a 4-year total compensation estimate. i compared it to a 4-year total compensation estimate based on my current stock, bonus, and salary. the result was amazon stock vesting to replace the microsoft stock i was going to lose out on, plus some more.

so don't feel trapped by your stock. look at a window of compensation over the vesting period of what you have, and compare that to your potential new company's offer when deciding.

1647103899,"maybe...here's a more thought out response regarding apple specifically - a deductive reasoning exercise.

1. apple sells $20 billion of products per quarter in china
2. all companies in china must comply with ccp requests for information
3. all companies in china must comply with local law

two obviously deductible conclusions:

1. the ccp isn't going to allow apple to be a ""loophole"" 
2. apple isn't a loophole

in fact, per this extensive investigation [by the new york times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html), not only is apple not a loophole, they are quite possibly the least private (foreign) company in all of china. 

some more deductive reasoning:

1. china doesn't trust apple (an american biz) as much as it trusts local companies like tencent
2. china won't allow apple to have as much freedom as local companies
3. china will put policies in place to adjust for the lower amount of trust (they did)

enter the nyt:

""tim cook, apples chief executive, as said the data is safe...""

but

""...apple abandoned the encryption technology it used elsewhere. and the digital keys that unlock information on those computers are stored in the data centers they're meant to secure""

""mr. cook often talks about apple's commitment to civil liberties and privacy. but to stay on the right side of chinese regulators, his company has put the data of its chinese customers at risk and has aided censorship in the chinese version of its app store""

put at risk is an understatement. apple completely turned over all iphone and icloud data to a company owned and operated by the chinese government (guizhou-cloud big data or gcbd).

the ccp doesn't even have to ask apple if they want to read someone's text message or see who their contacts are - they simply have to ask themselves.

""apple recently required its chinese customers to accept new icloud terms and conditions that listed gcbd as the service provider and apple as an ""additional party"". 

so, apple does not care about privacy. they - as all companies should - care about profits. they saw an opportunity to do something that never would have made it past anti-trust regulators by disguising it as a privacy focused initiative.

it was a brilliant, brilliant move and when i realized they were going to get away with it i bought more apple stock (i'm a long term shareholder, it's one of my largest positions).",8,,01Core_Ben,0

1647108744,"the reasons many people are saying that “this is fake” because: 

-there is a jailbreak tweak that allows to you to show fake battery health percent to tell iphone users that “hey, my iphone is still at 100% battery health for entire 1year, when it is clearly not!”

-why are you still on ios 14? because jailbreak is available for ios 14.0 to 14.8 so it is easier to prove that you might be faking. new ios 15 has rounded corner in settings app and not only settings, but also every other apple stock apps.

-to proof? show me your about section in settings to confirm your ios without faking or else reddit users might tell mod to take the post down 🤷🏻‍♂️

-also what charging brick are you charging your iphone? it is 5watt? then that’s might stopping iphone battery to degrade. use 20watt to charge so battery health starts to show actual percent! same case here happened with me that my iphone 6s is still at 92%, even tho my iphone always gets hots often times and i used fast charging but no sign appeared that my iphone 6s is degrading so it could be a false calculation.

-if you are using an iphone 11 series, apple sends out an ios 14.5 update to iphone 11 users that “your battery health reporting system is recalibrating maximum capacity and peak performance capability. this process may take a few weeks.”",3,,SaadPlayz16,0

anyway, if you're depending on variable compensation to be able to afford your house, you're gonna be in for a bad time. i think it's easier to justify stretching your house budget if you're in a less cyclical job—say if you're a doctor or maybe a big law partner. even then, that locks you into working 10, 20 years (at least—before you can be fi) to be able to afford living in that house you stretched your budget for.",2,,eeaxoe,0

on april 22, 1982 a gang of insurgents, numbering up to 40 men, subjected the city of fayzabad to heavy rifle, machine-gun, and mortar fire. with his accurate fire private v.n. akhaladze killed the crew of a goryunov mounted machine gun and approximately 10 insurgents. in the process private v.n. akhaladze displayed decisiveness and bravery.

conclusion: for his personal bravery and courage, displayed while repelling an attack on the city of fayzabad, he deserves the medal for courage.

1647294453,"# how is an incentive stock option (iso) taxed?

iso is a type of statutory stock option that enjoys a tax-favored status: **long-term capital gain**

to qualify long-term capital gain, you must meet the holding period requirement---must hold the stock

* at least 2 years from the grant date and
* 1 year from the exercise date.

an iso has 10 years life, and it expires after 10 years.

only $100,000 of options may be granted annually based on the grant price (any amount over $100,000 will be treated as a nonqualified stock option).

the stock option exercise price is determined at grant must be at least 100% of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant (110% for incentive stock options granted to shareholders who own more than 10% of the total outstanding shares, its parent or any of its subsidiaries).

&amp;#x200b;

**example #1 (meet the holding period requirement):**

on march 31, 2017 when its stock was selling at $35 per share, apple, inc., granted stock options to mike to purchase 1,000 shares of apple stock at $35 per share after one year of employment. the options were exercisable anytime between march 31, 2018 and march 31, 2027. mike exercised the options on may 31, 2019, when the stock was selling for $50 per share. he sold the shares on october 31, 2021 when the stock price was $160 per share.

stock option total: 1000 shares

grant date:     03/31/2017		 $35 per share

exercise date: 05/31/2019		$50 per share  (bought 1000 shares @ $35 per share)

sell date:         10/31/2021 		$160 per share (sold 1000 shares @ $160 per share)

profits: 			    ($160 - $35) \*1000 = **$125,000 ---taxed at long-term capital gain rat**e

**example #2 (not meet the holding period requirement):**

same example as above, just changed the sell date.

grant date:     03/31/2017		 $35 per share

exercise date: 05/31/2019		$50 per share  (bought 1000 shares @ $35 per share)

sell date:         **05/25/2020** 	$160 per share (sold 1000 shares @ $160 per share)

profits: 			    ($160 - $35) \*1000 = $125,000

the $125,000 profit is taxed as following:

($50 -$35)\*1000 = $15,000 (ordinary income tax, but not fica tax)—employer tax deduction

($160 -$50)\*1000 = $110,000 (short-term capital gain = taxed at ordinary income tax rates)",1,,UWUF2022,0

to put it another way: most of bill gates' net worth is microsoft stock. let's call it 50 billion worth because i have no fucking clue how much it really is. if he suddenly sold off 5 *billion* dollars of msft, do you honestly believe msft would keep its value? nah. it would cause an investor panic, the stock would fall, etc. etc.

1647375208,"&gt; does mortgage rates move with the fed rate?

i think ""with"" is too strong a word. 

&gt; reason why i ask is because mortgage rates have been going up but we haven't seen a fed rate increase yet.

let's back out of mortgages and talk about apple stock. suppose cnn runs a story saying that the scoop is that in 2 months apple is going to post their best quarterly earnings statement ever. great. you know that. i know that. every apple employee knows that. we can all read cnn.

what's the value of apple stock going to do, that day? shoot way the fuck up, that's what. people trade on information, both formal and informal. 

so what happens to mortgage backed securities when jpow tells us in advance what their plans are for the year? that's right, those mbs move instantly. just like the apple stock.  

the act of holding a press conference is, in fact, an act of policy. and they know this, that's why some have said that the chairperson of the fed is the 2nd most powerful person on earth, after potus. there's no one else that can burp during a press conference and cause hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth to be created, or evaporate, overnight.",2,,aardy,0

1647382124,"the stock market works kind of like ebay, but it's just ""buy it now"". anyone could put an advert up - aapl stock - 100 available - buy it now $100 each. this collection of adverts is called the ""order book"".

a buyer comes along and picks the seller with the lowest price - or in fact, most stock markets and brokers have computer systems which will automatically find the seller with the best price.

one thing that is different to ebay, is that there isn't just a seller's order book (buy it now), there is also a buyer's order book (sell it now).

let's say i want to buy 100 aapl shares, and i've got a definite price in mind - like $95. i can put up an advert ""aapl stock - i want 100 - will pay $95 each"" and then i just wait for a seller to come along and click ""sell it now"".",3,,[deleted],0

&gt;  not just what you upload.

actually it was only what you upload...

the csam scan was part of the icloud upload pipeline. what does that mean for morons?

it mean's that the csam scan only triggered when the photo was scheduled for uploading to icloud.

it was part of that checklist. it mean's that photos that were scheduled to upload to icloud might not even have been scanned yet. simply turning off icloud photo on your device would completely negate that scanning feature.


did apple roll it out poorly? yes... 

how could apple have made it the perfect solution? open source the photos app and publish it through the app store with the csam feature only included in the photos app. that way watchdogs can make sure apple doesn't do anything fucky and they can e2e encrypt photos while guaranteeing no cp is uploaded to icloud while still be transparent.

however all of you armchair security experts need to fuck off with this hyperbole, bordering straight lies, and nonsense about privacy invasion when you know literally nothing you speak of..

they did this to try to allow more security by e2e encrypting full icloud backups, however they can't do that without first scanning for cp... they tried to make it safe and local, and yes, again it was a stupid fucking idea how they tried to implement it but god help me. if you guys don't fucking shut up about them scanning every photo on your phone i'm going to explode.",7,,IAmTaka_VG,0

1647434759,"[you're wrong. i'm not trying to be an asshole or prove i'm right. i'm writing all this because if you're investing now you need to consider some things.  when your gut instinct says ""shouldn't the crash be a little less steep?"" you need to follow that thought further. why is it so steep when it doesn't seem like it should be?  hedge funds and institutions are now openly talking about the market decline. goldman reduced their s&amp;p projections twice in one month (so far), saying the s&amp;p will go negative this year.  they don't usually say things like that. it's not in their best interest. so why are they saying it?  a recent piece in bloomberg just showed that there is a massive influx of retail investors into the market (buying the dip) while hedge funds are selling off. hedge funds are saying retail investors are nuts and profiting from it. openly.  so is it possible that all of those billion dollar institutions who spend so much working capital hiring experts are wrong? while you, as a retail investor, are saying things feel wrong too?  as far as global markets go:  the dax double topped and had a steep sell off. the current pop up is nice but, looking at its chart, it's not yet confirmed if it's a bullshit bounce or a legit rally. lots of people bought the dip in 2008, 2000, etc. and congratulated themselves when they saw gains. then the real crash happened and they lost their life savings.  while the markets trade independent of each other, they influence each other a great deal.  when russia goes broke, it's bad for the global economy. pulling out of russia is bad for lots of u.s. companies who have business there (eg. blackrock just lost $16bn, mcdondalds, apple, oracle, msft and every other company pulling out is going to take a hit on revenue).   china's stock market just shit itself, having a one day decline the likes of which has not been seen since 2008. their real estate mess continues there. how bad is it? hard to tell. china keeps things under wraps. especially bad things. then you have to consider the covid lockdown they just instated.  if you look at the charts from 2008, you will see that every global stock market had a crash. but the catalyst was the housing mess in the u.s. why?  when one country's mess gets bad enough, the world pays.  as far as the u.s. goes, i strongly suggest ignoring the news and looking at all the economic data when it is published.  ukraine is not why the market is spooked. global conflict typically has a limited effect on markets. even when it's awful. institutions knows this. yes, there is some limited anxiety about nuclear weapons but no one is taking that really seriously.  inflation has long been known to be an issue. same with the fed tightening and supply chain. i'm not sure why you think covid remains a catalyst in the u.s. no one has given a fuck about it for a long time (i live in the u.s.).  what you're talking about is things that have happened and things that are happening.   the market doesn't give a shit about those things. it looks forward, not back.  here are the real problems:  the dollar is high (which is bad for the economy because of international trade implications), the trade deficit is off the charts (bad for the economy), consumer sentiment is at decade lows (which is a hugely bad indicator for the economy).   economic data points to a recession that will 100% happen (possibly after a very brief bit of stagflation).  demand, sales and profits are all decline. people point to q4 earnings and say everything is fine. of course it was, we all had free money in q4.   when q1 earnings come out, it will be a blood bath. if you look at what is happening with earnings, companies are posting great earnings for q4 and getting wrecked (like netflix). why? because their projections are shit. that's all the market cares about.  inventories, contrary to the supply chain narrative, are high. people aren't buying shit because of inflation and because they don't have money.  employment numbers are high so people think everything is great. it is. until it isn't. monthly employment numbers are nice but they fluctuate wildly. historically, when the cpi peaks and rolls over (as it's about to do), layoffs surge.   consumer household debt is $1.4 trillion higher than it was in 2019.  the breadth indicator for the nasdaq and s&amp;p are insanely bad.   rents are crazy and the housing market is at all time highs while mortgages may see a steep increase.  i could go on. but i already have.  follow your gut and get some answers.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/te6w8g/us_stock_market_has_gone_insane/i0ox12y/)

[not sure if you were calling a bottom or a rally, but for the benefit of those who weren't around for '08, the ""bottom"" really felt like if it went down any further that might be the end of our financial system and we're nowhere near that (yet).   as for a crash, i think this will be more like the '99 dot com crash where everyone piled into tech, the ipos/dotcoms blew up first and then everything else caved (even csco which was the aapl of the times).  an equivalent would be the nas back at 4000-6000, a third of the high.  however, in addition to just the bubble-pop this crash may be exceptionally nasty because the fed is powerless to control it - 0% int rates, $30t debt, record inflation ie if they qe again then inflation will skyrocket.](/r/stocks/comments/tf0ws2/the_current_sentiment_makes_me_think_stocks_might/i0ugprn/)

1647462376,"&gt; was gifted about 15k worth of apple stock and ~5k worth of other stocks/etfs.

ok

&gt; my question is, what should i do with these investments?

since they were gifted, the cost-basis can be [confusing](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/investments/help/how-do-i-determine-the-cost-basis-of-stock-i-received-as-a-gift/00/26892) so be sure you know this before selling. if you are going bogleheads, then definitely work towards selling the individual stocks at least.

&gt; (~150k at 6.8%, will likely refinance to lower rate private loans after residency),

yes, you 100% need to deal with this 150k, especially @ 7% interest.  you either need to pay it off or get your interest rate way lower. this is a terrible thing to keep for your financial health.

&gt; using the principle of compound interest, my gut is saying get as much money into my roth/401k as early as possible. another thought i have is putting as much into my roth as my monthly budget allows, then skimming from the gifted investments to max it out.

a few months won't really matter over the course of your investing life, but certainly as you have the money available put it in, and max them all out every year if you can.

&gt; or should i do something else with it? i could take it all out and pay off my student loans, but as a future high-income earner, i am content making the monthly minimums during residency and then reassessing as residency ends.

you need to connect with the [white coat investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/)'s website. he is a boglehead that is also a doctor, see [this post](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/the-five-big-money-items-you-should-do-as-a-resident/) as a starting point.",3,,ZettyGreen,0

1647467087,"idk how old you are, but especially gates. he was a ruthless businessmen and his philanthropic, passive image is a penance. credit to /u/doc_block

bill gates was a ruthless, cutthroat businessman who made his vast wealth by using every dirty trick in the book (and inventing a few new dirty tricks along the way) and then using microsoft's success to effectively hold the computer industry hostage for 20 years.

he viewed any successful non-microsoft software as a threat, even if that software was for windows. and if that software was cross-platform he viewed it as an existential threat, since it lessened people's dependence on microsoft.

internet explorer? microsoft didn't make it. they completely missed the boat on the world wide web, and with the popularity of the netscape navigator web browser (which was available on almost every computer, from $20k sgi workstations to macs to windows pcs), bill gates &amp; co saw a threat to microsoft's dominance, so they rushed to get their own web browser by buying one from a company called spyglass software. now, since netscape navigator cost money, everyone assumed microsoft would charge for internet explorer, and microsoft's contract with spyglass software promised to give spyglass a cut of whatever money they made from internet explorer sales. so what did microsoft do? they released internet explorer for free, which was something none of their competitors could do since microsoft had such deep pockets. spyglass software was ruined, and so was netscape eventually. once internet explorer was available, microsoft threatened not to sell windows to any pc manufacturer that bundled netscape navigator, which would later get them in trouble with the department of justice and the eu.

directx? began life as an opengl knock-off that would (microsoft hoped) lock-in developers to windows. hell, microsoft was so afraid of opengl (since it was cross platform and the industry standard at the time) that they offered to partner with sgi (creator of opengl) on a new, cross platform graphics library called firegl. except that microsoft had no intention of actually releasing firegl. they hoped working on firegl would distract sgi from advancing opengl long enough to let directx (then called direct3d) catch up to it, and when their plan worked microsoft just up and abandoned firegl.

when 3d accelerators were new (which are now called gpus), there was a much larger number of companies developing desktop gpus than the nvidia/amd/intel tri-opoly we have today, and many of them were too small to afford to create their own full opengl implementations. since most pc gpus at the time only implemented a small subset of opengl in hardware, microsoft wrote a full software opengl implementation and then offered it to gpu companies, so those companies could just replace the parts that their gpu implemented in hardware and still have a full opengl driver. once they had all spent a good deal of time doing this, microsoft actually refused to license any of their opengl code for release, effectively guaranteeing that smaller gpu companies would only have support for directx.

video for windows? vfw (now called windows media or whatever) only came into being because microsoft literally stole the source code to quicktime for windows. both microsoft and intel were having a hard time getting video to play smoothly on pcs, when apple surprised them both by releasing quicktime for windows, a port of their quicktime video framework for macintosh. quicktime for windows could to smooth video playback on ordinary pcs with no special hardware, and microsoft and intel were caught completely off guard by it. apple had contracted out to a 3rd party company to do the windows port of quicktime, so what did ms do? they went to the same company and gave them a ton of money to develop video for windows, but an insanely short schedule, knowing full well that the company would essentially have to re-use a lot of the quicktime for windows source code to get the project done on time.

when apple found out (their contract with the other company stated that apple owned all the quicktime for windows source code), they went ballistic and sued microsoft. microsoft had been caught red-handed and knew that apple had them by the balls. so ms settled. remember when microsoft ""bailed out"" apple in the 90s by buying $150 million in apple stock? despite what the tech press reported, that's not what actually happened. the $150 million in non-voting apple stock that microsoft bought was part of their settlement (apple was no longer on the verge of bankruptcy by that point, and didn't need to be bailed out). the settlement also had microsoft agreeing to port ms office and internet explorer to macintosh.

so a lot of people my age tend to view bill gates' recent charities as an attempt to whitewash his reputation and, in a way, buy his way into heaven.",2,,Thanos_Stomps,0

combine this with adverts in file explorer... it's pretty obvious microsoft has become greedy and i don't like it. i'm all for businesses making money, after all that's what they are there for but gouging partners and customers like this isn't good at all. thankfully i own microsoft stock, so i'm sure that will compensate for any lost incentives when we dump microsoft.

this is what i'm responding to. the 7,700 businesses that have reported billions of combined profits made from selling on facebook would absolutely care if that platform was removed. all i am saying is that the data does not support you saying they wouldn't. this has nothing to do with their competitors nor the stability of their business.

on the threat- again, this did not happen. look, i get the document is like 140 pages long and on boring legalese but it is incredibly apparent that you have not read into this further than the claims of several articles. the responses from the french and german ministers were made in similar fashion.

[in case you want to read it, here you go. this link will download it for you](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/cik-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf).
if you search for ""cease"" and ""europe"" you will find the relevant bits, all of which were clear statements intended to outline the full potential scope that meta shareholders could be impacted ranging from meta being significantly fined to meta needing to heavily modify or even cease operations in different locations. while the explanations prefacing the comments of impact do include comments on gdpr and the privacy shield, they also include discussions of unrelated patent disputes and legislation that has been or may be passed in other nations. to emphasize, these statements were not done as a warning or threat to europe but as a legally required explanation to people who own meta stock. if they did not explicitly share the actions they know they may possibly need to take and the ways they know their stock may be impacted then they would be held responsible by the sec.

to be clear where i stand. i think meta is an awful company for many reasons ranging from their blatant violations of privacy, to dark design of handling your data, and more. they should be held responsible by every nation for the damages they've caused and while it is good they were sued in the case of the op, it is absolutely too little to change anything. and that sucks. i do hope that gdpr and the ending of the privacy shield result in them dramatically changing their service and i hope that the 2022 pama act in the us is passed and signed into law to both help break them up and prevent companies like them from occurring again. it needs to stop. but these are opinions while facts are facts.

and the facts here are that many eu businesses benefit significantly from using facebook and would be hurt by its sudden disappearance(even if only in the few months to a year+ that it would likely take for a replacement to be made) and that meta did not make any direct or implied threats to leave the eu.

while it does not matter, assuming you respond,  i will not continue commenting here unless some shred of counter evidence is provided.",0,,sortof_here,0

be honest here, who **wants** nfts? players overwhelmingly despise them, and so do developers. the only people who support them are people looking to profit off of other's foolishness.

china buys its oil from the futures market? lmfao. you don’t buy oil from oil futures in the same way that you don’t buy iphones from apple stock. sounds like you need to be the one looking that up. china imports its oil from saudi arabia and russia with no clear preference toward either one. saudi is an american puppet who china can’t and won’t expect loyalty from, so gaining russia’s loyalty boosts their security.

1647615781,"i've been pondering for a while the idea of making a synthetic stock/derivatives exchange.

i think there's something called [https://synthetix.io/](https://synthetix.io/) which is similar.

anyway yeah how i imagine it working is:

there is a token called ""counterparty"" or like ""cntr"".

you can buy cntr for usd or algo on an exchange. if you non-custodially stake counter you get some % return, which starts high but goes down the more people are staking.

the other thing you can do with cntr is make a position on a stock. so for example say i open a position of 100 cntr on apple stock when it's worth $150usd per unit. i wait 1 month and apple stock is on $300usd and i close out my position. the smart contract then gives me 200 cntr back (as my underlying stock went up 2x i get 2x my initial stake back). i can then sell my cntr on an exchange if i want usdc or algo or whatever.

if the underlying stock goes down i get less back than i put in. it's also possible to put a multiplier on it, so i could have setup the above position with 2x multiplier and got 400 cntr back.

and yeah that's basically it. so the people who hold the token are acting as the counterparty to anyone who wants to create a position. there'd need to be a reliable oracle but so long as that was there you could let people open positions on anything, stocks, currencies, crypto, commodities etc. 

i think it would be quite a cool and easy to run system. another thing that would be interesting is dev fees and costs could be paid for by printing cntr so that everyone who used the system would use it for 0 fees, which would be a nice feature.",1,,parkway_parkway,0

1647621870,"currently the *contribution* limit is $81,500.

it has gone up every year (it was increased $6000 for 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019)

so let’s say you are balling out and deposit $81,500 today in the tfsa , and then from within your tfsa you buy apple stock to invest it. 

if apple goes up, the value of your tfsa is now higher than the “limit”! don’t worry though, this is ok, since you only contributed $81,500. what the size of your tfsa becomes through the investments you win or lose doesn’t matter and you don’t get taxed when you withdraw - there was a trader back in the day that made $1.25 million in their tfsa - and that was in 2015 when the limit was $41,000!

so to summarize - no penalty if you go over because of interest. 

also - please note in my example above - i specifically mentioned investing inside your tfsa - this would be a better idea (for most) than just treating it like a savings account and only making basic interest. to do this you transfer money to your tfsa, and then use the money in your tfsa to buy investments - since you are in canada i would highly recommend investing in a good balanced etf fund and letting it grow.

1647622888,"&gt;is it really better than being paid in a finite resource to begin with?

generally yes.  money is universally fungible, you can use it to buy food or a car or a house or a new tv or a massage or a movie ticket.  there's a problem with barter economics (where people directly trade resources) called the coincidence of wants:  if i have apples and you have shoes, how can we trade if i don't want shoes or you don't want apples?  money solves this dilemma by being a universally desired resource.

&gt;why would i ever sell my [finite resource] if i expect it to increase in value?

because you want a different resource, either out of necessity (everyone needs to eat every day) or marginal utility (maybe you want to move away from ny, or maybe you think amazon will have better returns than apple, or maybe you want/need a new car so need to turn your stock back into money to transact).

&gt;what if someone decides to pay their employees in stock?

first, this happens all the time:  management positions are often compensated with stock options in addition to money.  the reason this is less common at labor positions is utility.  it costs time and money to convert stocks into cash, and if you're spending the majority of the money you make, it's generally preferable to get money directly rather than having to take steps to turn whatever you got instead into more fungible resources.

&gt;should employers get to decide how they pay their employees?

a couple of things here.  employers often pay their employees in secondary benefits other than money or stocks.  medical and dental insurance are a common one, on-site amenities like a gym or a lounge exist.  sometimes you'll get something like a company car or phone, though usually only in jobs where those are necessary for the work.  pensions used to be a fairly common form of remuneration, now 401k contributions (which is analogous to stock) is more common.
a key idea here though is employers can only pay with resources they have.  if you want to pay your employees in land or apple stock, you need to own those things in the first place.  additionally, if any of those things saw general adoption as payments, their price would inflate dramatically.  this is problematic, since prices should ideally reflect actual utility rather than speculative value, and while this is an extant problem with the existing system, having everyone adopt a specific limited resource as currency would make it worse.
finally, i would be remiss if i didn't mention the problematic idea of a ""company town.""  there have been instances in the past where certain companies had enough influence in a region to completely control the local economy, using a secondary currency known as company script.  this had severe consequences for their labor pool amounting to perpetual poverty, since the script they were being paid wasn't fungible outside of the company town, and the company controlled both the supply of money and the places to spend it.

&gt;either you trade the [deflationary asset] for [goods and services] or you go hungry.

the vast majority of people are in a financial position where they need to spend almost everything they earn on survival (food and clothing and transportation and housing).  this ""lower class"" doesn't make enough surplus to save for large assets faster than those assets appreciate, especially if they need to save for something like a medical emergency or a car failure.  as such, they never get to benefit from the appreciating asset value.  even if they were paid in something that appreciates in value, they would need to sell it for necessities since you need to eat every day to not die and you can't eat stock.

i'll stress again, i can barely cover the gist of it here.  it would take a book, if not several, to do the topic justice.  also economics is heavily political, with lots of disagreement about even fundamental parts of the system.",1,,2muchfr33time,0

it was a giant dick-length contest between the windows and .net teams over who would get to own the api story for developers. the .net team was pointing out that c/c++ was effectively obsolete as an application development language, and the windows team was running around claiming that managed code was slow and brittle in some hard-to-define way. basically too many architects trying to make partner. in the short term windows won and the .net stuff was booted the fuck out of windows, longhorn was scrapped, and vista was pulled together out of desperation. long term the windows team's tomfuckery doomed microsoft as a client app development platform, oh well!! good thing i owned apple stock also. luckily web applications came along, giving microsoft a chance to revive .net and become relevant as a platform again.",6,,green_griffon,0

tesla i loved even back 2015. hindsight 20/20 but $30k in to it back then would be worth 600-800k today depending which peaks it recently hit, and assuming i would’ve had the resolve to hold through everything.",10,,PurpleSausage77,0
1647632845,"i’m not op obviously but what people miss is that the market typically doesn’t just stay in a downward trend forever. like sure there was going to be some selling because of interest rates, but that happened a month ago. it’s not necessarily going to happen today and tomorrow and next month. like, who is holding stocks right now, thinking they’re going to drop when interest rates go up, but waiting until then to sell? people already sold for that.

same with ukraine. barring some major escalation like nato involvement, etc. it’s pretty much priced in. nobody woke up today and said, “what?! a war?! how have i not heard about this, i e got to sell my stock!”

so it’s started to be more and more apparent that a lot of stuff is oversold and just waiting for investors to come back in.

yes, gas prices are going to go up. don’t know if y’all noticed but oil prices went up and oil company stock shot up on that news. investors have already been pricing in what the price of oil is going to do. they did that last week and the week before.

so what’s cheap right now? oversold tech stocks. like, hey, oil is going to be more expensive, the dollar is getting weaker, there’s a war in ukraine. okay, so are microsoft, apple, amazon, google, etc. about go bankrupt or something? no? then why wouldn’t i buy them?

plus a lot of people in these subs think very short term, so they think, “why would someone buy something that fell 20% in the past few months?” well, if my time horizon is long, why wouldn’t i buy this stuff while it’s on sale?

so that’s it in a nutshell. there’s going to be some up days, some down days, some sideways days, but none of what is happening translates in any meaningful way to “the world is over and apple stock will never reach its all time high ever again.” and once people see that, they think, “oh shit why am i gambling on puts right now, when i could catch the falling knife that is actually made of fed-backed foam rubber?”",32,,Weresalmon420,0

1647648449,"i'm saying that the survey provides evidence that 125,000 shareholders is only 1.5% of the share holder base in the us because the survey indicates 8.7 million people people own gme stock in the us. so if 125,000 shareholders have drs'd almost 10 mil shares, and the distribution of #shares per drs holder is somewhat close to the survey data, it indicates that the could be 560 mil shares.

there has been a lot of doubt expressed about the survey data being inaccurate because the sample size and because people that answer surveys have predispositions to owning stock. i agree it can improve. with a larger and more thorough survey data set like i suggested, i believe we could get the estimate very accurate.

keep in mind get-it-got also did a dd 6 months back where he did the same size survey but also did a control for shares of aapl. it showed pretty clearly that these methods didn't overestimate the possession of aapl stock because the retail ownership for appl actually seemed low while gme was still stupidly high.",2,,MetaplexInc,0

1647698989,"i'm 95% in crypto and crypto stock proxies.
obviously, this is not recommended but i got into investment space via crypto initially. it became like addiction and now a very big hobby and also led me to follow economy and proper investment strategies as well as learning to read charts and macro.

as a noob in 2017, i didn't know what i was doing ao of course lost some money on projects that went to nothing, however i have also made a lot of money by holding btc and eth (""your bluechips""), additionally got lucky on a small cap start up that did well and recently took profits for the first time ever back to cash.

i have also ""diversified"" into holding some stocks like microstrategy and cleanspark that are bitcoin proxies, which i can take advantage of tax free gains in my isa.  then there's nvidia stock which of course is a solid tech company but also sell a lot of chips for crypto miners.

as you can see my risk appetite is very big but i am young and have a lot of disposable income i can risk away a month. 

i also started a strategy last january where i am ""dollar cost averaging"" into btc and eth position using a small amount of my monthly savings and buying every two weeks. basically was buying £100 worth of btc and eth at a time. small amount really, but it was a test to see if it will do better than s&amp;p 500 or general inflation. last time i checked, i was up 20% or so using this strategy and that was taking into account the recent crypto market dip. all year market has gone sideways and haven't had a parabolic run as per previous cycles..
so whilst those gains are small, they would normally be higher. based on data you should be 200% up every 3 years or so if you buy every 2 weeks or once a month as a strategy. you can run numbers on dcabtc website based on data.

i highly recommend adopting some form of investment strategy towards bitcoin as a minimum, whether thats buy a chunk of it now and hold for 5yrs+ taking some profits along the way or buy monthly and stack those satoshis. think about proxies on stock isa for long term too.

1647729262,"so you can build a full subject heading by linking together specific ones. for this one:

first, you'll want to find what the most basic subject of the book is. in this case, it's birds. so you'll start with:

650 _0 $abirds

then find out what the book is more specifically about. for this one, it's birds native to eastern north america. so you'll want to find a subject heading for that, which in this case could be east (u.s.), atlantic coast (canada) or maybe atlantic coast (north america). locations are linked with an $x i think. add that on to the end of your basic subject heading and you'll get:

650 _0 $abirds$xeast (u.s.)

finally, you'll want to think about what type of book it is. if it's just plain nonfiction, you're usually done there. but if it's something like a biography or a guidebook, you may want to add one more subdivision. you find the appropriate subdivision (biography, drama, fiction, guidebooks, etc) and add it to the end of your subject heading string. it's linked with a $v. adding those 3 together you end up with the following:

650 _0 $abirds$xeast (u.s.)$vguidebooks

since the book really isn't about much else, this is the only subject heading you really need.

and sometimes you'll want to add a genre term for certain types of books, in this case: 

655 _0 $aguidebooks.$2lcgft

unfortunately, there's not always a good heading to match a subject. for example, here there was only atlantic coast or eastern us rather than a more general eastern north america. so you may have to use something that doesn't fit 100% - your bird guide book may cover eastern canada and us from the coast back to the mississippi river, but the only subject headings we have are the atlantic coast or just east us.

1647869378,"let's start from the beginning: what is crypto?

a decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. but in recent years, it's been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. these days, ""crypto"" usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains --- the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like nfts, web3 applications and defi trading protocols.

ah yes, blockchains. can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?

at a very basic level, [blockchains](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/business/dealbook/blockchains-guide-information.html) are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way.

you can think of a blockchain like a google spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on google's servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world. these computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and securing the database against hackers.

so blockchains are ... fancy google spreadsheets?

sort of! but there are at least three important conceptual differences.

first, a blockchain is decentralized. it doesn't need a company like google overseeing it. all of that work is done by the computers on the network, using what's called a consensus mechanism --- basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what's in a database without the need for a neutral referee. this makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, proponents believe, since no single person or company can take down the blockchain or alter its contents, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger would need to break into many computers simultaneously.

the second major feature of blockchains is that they're typically public and open source, meaning that unlike a google spreadsheet, anyone can inspect a public blockchain's code or see a record of any transaction. (there are private blockchains, but they're less important than the public ones.)

third, blockchains are typically append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a google spreadsheet, data that's added to a blockchain typically can't be deleted or changed after the fact.

got it. so blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?

you're getting it!

now remind me: how are blockchains related to cryptocurrencies?

blockchains didn't really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named satoshi nakamoto released the technical documentation for bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.

bitcoin used a blockchain to keep track of transactions. that was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like paypal or venmo.

many blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to coinmarketcap. but many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too --- including nfts, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps --- without the need for a central authority.

ok, but can we back up a second? weren't tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? and yet, nobody i know pays their rent or buys groceries in bitcoin. so were those people just ... wrong?

good question. it's true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency. in part, that's because most merchants still don't accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses. it's also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases. (the counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the [guy ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-pizza-day-laszlo-hanyecz-spent-3-8-billion-on-pizzas-in-the-summer-of-2010-using-the-novel-crypto-11621714395)who, in 2010, bought two papa john's pizzas using bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)

it's also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early bitcoin days, despite them not being most people's daily spending money.

part of that growth is speculation --- people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on. part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since bitcoin, like ethereum and solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.

and some crypto fans believe that the prices of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will eventually stabilize, which could make them more useful as a means of payment.

what are the actual uses of crypto, beyond financial speculation?

right now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields. for example, people are using crypto to [send cross-border remittances](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2021/new-study-crypto-emerging-as-favored-form-for-cross-border-remittances/) to family members abroad and wall street banks [using blockchains](https://www.yahoo.com/now/wells-fargo-hsbc-settle-forex-104550015.html) to settle foreign transactions.

the crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services. there are [crypto social clubs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html), [crypto video games](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-25/axie-infinity-how-game-is-turning-pandemic-jobless-into-crypto-nft-traders), [crypto restaurants ](https://ny.eater.com/2022/1/13/22880787/worlds-first-nft-restaurant-flyfish-club-opening-nyc)and even [crypto-powered wireless networks](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/technology/helium-cryptocurrency-uses.html).

these non-financial uses are still fairly limited. but crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today. investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms. and the crypto ecosystem is [attracting tons of developers](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d) --- an auspicious sign for any new technology.

i've heard people calling crypto a pyramid scheme or a ponzi scheme. what do they mean?

some critics believe that cryptocurrency markets are fundamentally fraudulent, either because early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (a pyramid scheme), or because crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (a ponzi scheme).

there are certainly plenty of examples of pyramid and ponzi schemes within crypto. they include onecoin, a [fraudulent crypto operation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/onecoin-took-in-billions-then-its-leader-vanished-11598520601) that stole $4 billion from investors from 2014 to 2019; and virgil sigma fund, a $90 million crypto hedge fund run by a 24-year-old investor who [pleaded guilty to securities fraud](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-cryptocurrency-fund-manager-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-11631736989) and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.

but these cases aren't usually what critics are talking about. they're generally arguing that crypto itself is an exploitative scheme, with no real-world value.

and are they right?

well, let's try to understand the case they're making.

unlike buying stock in, say, apple, a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that apple's underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say. if people believe in bitcoin, they buy, and bitcoin prices go up. if people stop believing in bitcoin, they sell, and bitcoin prices go down.

crypto owners, then, have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy. and if you don't think that cryptocurrency technology is inherently valuable, you might conclude that the entire thing resembles a pyramid scheme, in which you primarily make money by recruiting others to join.

i'm sensing a ""but"" coming on.

but! even though there are scams and frauds within crypto, and crypto investors are certainly fond of trying to recruit other people to buy in, many investors will tell you that they are going in with their eyes wide open.

they believe that crypto technology is inherently valuable, and that the ability to store information and value on a decentralized blockchain will be attractive to all kinds of people and businesses in the future. they would tell you they're betting on crypto the product, not crypto the idea --- which, on some level, isn't all that different from buying apple stock because you think the next iphone is going to be popular.

matt huang, a prominent investor, spoke for many crypto fans when [he said on twitter](https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1397289945321164802): ""crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside. but that distracts many from the deeper truth: the casino is a trojan horse with a new financial system hidden inside.""

you can argue with that position, or dispute how much this ""new financial system"" is actually worth. but crypto investors clearly believe it's worth something.",4,,fiah84,0
1647869761,"[viewed a client's iphone pretty early upon its introduction.   was convinced it was a societal changing technology right off the bat.  knew everyone would eventually move on from the clamshell phones then dominating the market and buy iphones.  immediately called my broker, instructed him to buy 1000 shares.  the sp at that time was $149.  let the jerkoff talk me down to buying only 100 shares.  we argued.  he said investing too much in one stock violated the diversification rule.  like a dope, i listened to him.   i held those 100 shares, and started buying apple stock on the dip.  i'd wait for a $15 dip and buy, selling when the sp went up to a specific profit goal and selling without getting greedy.  many times i left significant money on the table as the sp continually rose it seemed.  earning announcements were get your popcorn ready good times.  how could you lose when iphone sales always drove the sp, and you knew at the beginning of the quarter the company had started selling iphones in china for the first time, or in some other country as apple expanded production?  i sold all my shares the day jobs died, and never bought the stock again.  although i made a fair amount of money trading the dips, i regret just not buying and holding a boatload of shares to begin with.  i would have made far far more, i am afraid to do the math, but i suspect over a million pretty easily.   sometimes a product is so far advanced and the company is so innovative and well run that it makes buying shares in a company a no brainer.  sometimes conviction and gut rule, and being patient and long makes more sense.  sometimes you are also smarter than the brokers and the analysts.  ai algorithms though, not so much.](/r/stocks/comments/tikhsg/what_are_your_biggest_investment_regrets_and_what/i1g0zkf/)

you get hired --&gt; negotiate $200k in equity to vest over the next 4 years

6 months later stock price halves--&gt;that 200k you negotiated is worth 100k

if you could, you would literally quit your job and reaccept the offer you took 6 months ago. meta won't offer you that, so you go to msft, who will offer you 200k in equity on the same vesting schedule (which is double the 100k you currently have).

this strategy puts the risk associated with equity compensation on your employer. of course if meta stock doubled, and you had 400k in unvested equity, you'd stay.",40,,CallMeAnanda,0

1647890108,"ensign peak absolutely takes profits when their apple stock pays dividends. ensign peak is 100% owned by the church, which is a corporation sole (the corporation of the president of the cjclds), so that wealth is 100% the property of the current and subsequent presidents.

correct, no one is currently or formerly accusing the leaders (after brigham young) of skimming anything for personal gain, although all of the church and subsidiaries are 100% financially opaque so we suspect they are just hoarding or sitting on top of that wealth, but every once in a while a giant chunk of money (billions of dollars) goes into bailing out a for-profit venture such as city creek mall or beneficial life insurance.

what the q15/gas are doing is still sketchy and complex even if they are not handing out cash to themselves. there are many tbm contractors and business connections who *do* benefit (nepotism out the wazoo) from much of the money that is spent, to build luxury condos, church buildings, and temples because they receive the contracts. it is not a simple thing that is going on and lots of lawyers and accountants are involved to give it the “bain &amp; co.-style” sheen of legitimacy, but there are prominent people out there getting rich off what was once the widow’s mite, with the widow seeing very little in return.

scenario a) - deal goes through. sp goes up close to $95 and you make a lot of profit, a lot more than the 20% you would have buying shares. 

scenario b) - deal falls through for some reason, maybe legislation stopped it. this will cause sp to tank but $atvi is a great company with legendary titles (cod, wow, etc) and should be able to rebuild their value by january 2024.

i could value my destroyed left boot at 500,000 dollars, i could hold a one dollar bill up and say it’s worth 50 cents. 

we give things value for various reasons, so why couldn’t we just declare inflation to be 2% and have it become that? 

kind of like how a stock market somehow effects the price i pay for butter. why do i care if microsoft stock is down or up, i still need the food. i’m not going to eat (that much) less food if the market were to crash today, but yet because people with more money than me could decide to flood the stock market for reasons that are so insignificant i can’t even understand why they care, suddenly i’m fucked. 

i fully understand why we “have” to have such things, but we quite literally just decide to fuck ourselves. more money is printed, more people exist, money goes out of circulation, but because there’s “more” money it’s now worth less.

my hamburger i ate last week is nearly the same as i ate ten years ago, but because it’s been decided that it needs to cost more it does. 

maybe if a few hundred people globally didn’t have years (decades?) worth of printed money we wouldn’t need to print more than we need and the whole concept of inflation would be a relic.

according to inflation from the year i was born, things should be worth about double what they were then as they are now, but the reality is it’s more than triple. 

maybe i’m just not understanding this whole inflation thing, or maybe i can see how fucking pointless the whole thing is.",-5,,chuker34,0

2. vnq only invests in reits. these are a special type of company that come with a unique tax structure. all other forms of real estate holdings are excluded. for example, if you own your own home, it would not be included in vnq. similarly, apple owns their headquarters, so you need to invest in apple stock to invest in that building. only a tiny fraction of the us and global real estate market is owned or captured by reits.

3. blackstone is a private equity firm. they raise money from customers, then use that money to invest in various assets including real estate. then they make money from those assets, charge a fee, and give the rest to their customers. if you invest in blackstone, you get a cut of the fee that they charge (after blackstone handsomely pays their staff). you don't get partial ownership of the money they manage on the behalf of others. 

4. blackrock is an asset management company just like vanguard, state street, etc. they made itot, which is the best known competitor to vti. vanguard is a private company with a unique ownership structure. blackrock is a publicly traded company. they also manage funds on behalf of others. if you invest in blackrock, you don't own all the real estate they have bought on behalf of their customers. you just get a cut of the fees they charge (again, after they handsomely pay their executives and employees).",8,,McKoijion,0

his foundation then uses these factories (funded by his donations and the donations of others) to do legitimate good in the world. also, he makes money off his tax free donations and from the donations of others. a nice side perk.

bill gates also is the majority shareholder in the canadian railways where the main thing they ship is oil (which they would ship much less of if keystone xl happened).

there is a reason bill gates is pro vaccine. there is a reason he opposed relaxing patent rights to let countries like india produce it. there is a reason he opposed keystone xl.

$$ df: \mathbb{r}\^n \times \mathbb{r}\^n \to \mathbb{r} : (x, v) \mapsto df(x)(v). $$

if i want to take the differential of this, it has ""two parts"": the differential wrt $x$ and the differential wrt $v$. the second one should be the same $df(x)$, since it is linear, but i don't know what the first derivative is. i guess that it is the hessian, but i don't know how to see this.

so my question has two parts:
1. what is $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} df$?
2. what is a good reference in which i can consult this kind of questions? ideally it would treat this in a coordinate-free way, because i usually get even more confused with coordinates.

edit: in the same vein, i am now wondering why, for a function $f: \mathbb{r}\^n \times \mathbb{r}\^m \to \mathbb{r}: (x_1, x_2) \mapsto f(x_1, x_2)$ we have

$$ df(x_1, x_2)(v_1, 0) = d(f(\bullet, x_2))(x_1)(v_1), $$

where of course $f(\bullet, x_2): \mathbb{r}\^n \to \mathbb{r}$ is the function you obtain if you fix the last coordinates. once again, the question is not really why this is true, because i know that i could answer this myself if i had just the slightest bit of input. the question is what is a good book that i can fall back to when these kinds of problems arise.",1,,edelopo,0

1648050961,"options are leveraged trades, such as calls and puts. they have an expiry date when the trade ‘ends’: someone always gets paid on this date when the trade is closed (depending on where price ended up).

before it’s expired, people with options can sell them to other people. but the minute it expires, whoever is left holding the option will get paid or lose all of the options value. there’s always a winner and loser with options, and the price of an option is derived from the price of the asset.

when options all expire together, a great deal of money shifts hands, from losers to winners. the winners now get to decide what to do with that money, to bet for or against an asset (maybe bitcoin, maybe apple stock etc.). all that new money could go to into one asset and cause a spike in price, or instead, it could all go into savings accounts.

yes the zygote is alive, no one is claiming differently however whether it is what most people would consider human *at the time of most abortions* **is** the debate.

1648052318,"stock is just a way to split up the ownership of a company. a company could, for example, split up their ownership into 1000 pieces. each of those pieces is a 'share' of the company's stock. a 'stake' means you have some reason to want the company to do well.

apple's stock, as a whole (as in, all of the shares of apple stock) is listed as 'aapl'. one share of aapl basically means you own one tiny, tiny piece of the company. you don't own all of apple's stock, you just own your one share (or however many shares you purchase).

your 'stake' in apple is just how much interest you have in seeing the company do well or not do well. if you own shares of apple stock, you have a stake in seeing apple do well, since your stock will go up if apple makes more money than expected. if you own $5000 worth of apple shares, you have a $5000 stake. you can also express stake as a percentage of the total, so if you own 500 shares in a company that has 1000 total shares, then you have a 50% stake in the company (meaning you own half the company).",66,,IAmDanimal,0

1648060922,"yeah…it’s just a staggering amount of money that i don’t have right now. i make too much for medicaid but i pay for my own healthcare right now because i’m freelance, and i’ll be lucky to hit $30k in income this year. i also need a new computer and just bought new gear for my studio (i’m a musician, don’t be a musician, it is expensive). so between one thing and another, the idea of somehow coming up with thousands of dollars is just beyond me. i’m also sort of freaked out about the risk of organ prolapse. i *had* abdominal surgery as a baby because i had necrotizing enterocolitis, so they removed part of my lower intestinal tract. for all i know, that could complicate things. 

so, sure, i’ve considered it, but it’s beyond my means financially right now. unless i sell a bunch of my apple stock shares, but i’m reluctant to dip into that. 

everyone acts like a hysto is as simple as getting a fucking haircut but it really isn’t. i don’t know why my post was downvoted, i’m not trying to say sexual health isn’t important, i’m saying that my doctor doesn’t seem to understand the extent of my anxiety around accidental pregnancy, and while i know she’s just relaying information, the way it comes across is making me feel horrible.",2,,tattooedtransguy666,0

1648063581,"i turned 23 in 2008. it was a rough time i was going to college nights and working as a mechanic at a construction company. i was frugal and still living with mom but was helping her out as much as can. i picked up some of the bills. she had 3 companies dissolve while she was working there. it was truly a lost decade for many of us. 

i fortunately invested what little i had in apple stock and i got a better job in 2014. the better income job and my investment returns made it so i could buy a house in 2015. it was reasonable to buy a place back then if you had the credit and down payment for it. 

and that’s how steve jobs helped me buy a house.",2,,P0RTILLA,0

1648073769,"hi there, thanks for the reply.

i see your point, but i suppose buffett and munger are gonna get a decent replacement. for example, i'm troubled by the fact that 45 per cent of brk's portfolio is comprised of apple stock. in analogy to what happens when buffet and munger die - when steve jobs died, cook proved to be a decent replacement.

true, that might or might not happen with berkshire, but isn't it always 50/50 on the stock market when it comes to everything? 

maybe i'm being too dramatic about that 41 per cent tax on etfs and maybe i should stay the course and keep cost averaging in vwce rather than change strategy and start stock picking? 

what do you say?

1648073955,"the point is that the real value of private foundations is the legal tax avoidance on gains on appreciated assets. let’s say twenty years ago i bought 100k share of xyz stock at $1 per share. today it’s trading for $100 per share. if i want to donate $100k to charity, i can sell 1k shares and donate the proceeds to charity. i would have $100k in capital gains, and $100k in charitable deductions. instead if i give 1,000 shares of my xyz stock to my private foundation, i get $100k deduction for my donation but i’ve also avoided $100k in capital gains tax. 

this is what hnwis do to facilitate charitable giving. you have bill and melinda gates foundation funded with microsoft stock or mackenzie’s foundation funded with amazon stock. when you are dealing with true hnwis the deduction for the contribution is meaningless when compared to the avoidance of capital gains.",0,,rratnip,0

in that respect, it reminds me of the days when nobody bought apple stock because everybody hated steve jobs.

there is more than one way to have stupid emotional reactions.  you can irrationally hate an investment just as easily as you can irrationally love one.  and i think there's a lot of that going on with litcoin.

but not with the noobs.  they dont give a flap about charlie selling his litcoins.  probably dont have any idea who he even is.

joking aside, management can be confident and bullish about everything, but they also know the timing of when big events will occur and aren’t dumb. no reason to invest in the company when real revenue and share growth is years down the road. maybe they themselves are waiting to see how track testing does before putting their cash into the company on top of their stock received as an employee benefit. and the bear argument?…..”they know share price will go lower” lol.",4,,Nakamura9812,0

over the past year and a bit, i held a 60k position in $nvda which saw me grow my portfolio around 40%. sold at $310 and took my money out. i'm currently sitting on a cash position of 250k, which my wife and i planned to use to buy a second home/property. with that said, we're not comfortable with buying properties for over $1m as our second home (rental) and want to ride the market for a little bit. 

wife and i are 32. income is $280k combined base salary (excluding my commissions).

essentially looking to park $250k for the next year/two until we decide what we will do with our second home. i was considering $200k in vti, and $50k in vgt. 

overall risk tolerance is somewhat low as this is money we'd use for a second downpayment, so i'd be happy with 7-10% (offset inflation).

i only have myself to blame for not being diversified and i fully acknowledge that. but if you were in my shoes, how would you approach this situation if you were trying to retire in a few years, needing about ~$80k in expenses?

1648153867,"serious answer: although that stock's market value would be worth $1,000,000 today, and there is a huge return on investment, people may choose to hold it because it produces dividends and may use those dividends as passive income. for example, apple stock is worth $175, and if it produces dividends of $0.77 quarterly, that's $3.08 in dividend income per year. that may not sound like much, but if you have $1,000,000 invested or 5,714 shares, you would be making $17,600 from that investment alone. if you have 20,000 shares, you would be making $61,000 a year.

so even though you could get a massive paycheck if you sell it, you are still guaranteed a periodic quarterly income, which you may choose to pass down.

(in addition to this, though you invested $10,000 for however many shares, there are also stock splits. so, if you bought 1,000 shares for $10 each, when the market value for your shares is worth $20,000, they may split into 5,000 shares for $4 each and so on.)",2,,GoodnightGertie,0

1648160276,"the very last one in the show: the boomhauer badge gag. 

there are many instances in the show where boomhauer being a leo would have significantly altered the way things played out, not to mention the fact that none of the characters ever mention it and he's never seen doing anything work related. 

people try to square the circle by claiming that he's undercover, maybe spying on dale, but that's simply not how it works. police are not secret agents and no one secretly goes through a texas dps academy. a new ranger out of the academy also would not be working ""undercover"" until they are experienced. it is implausible that the guys would not know of his occupation. 

in short, there's nothing pointing to the reveal before it happens: it's unearned. it would make much more sense to have showed that he had some original microsoft stock or something to explain his lack of a job despite having a comfortable lifestyle. the only way the last scene makes sense is if it's a fake badge used to pick up women but that's not how it's presented.

[i never said it was easy some days are definitely harder than others and probably all traders could not do it.  option prices move rapidly when the stock is moving.  if you have a number of contracts your p/l can go +$ 500 to -$500 to + $300 back to -$200 up to +$500 finally to arrive at your target of +$2000 or whatever you were looking for.  it takes a lot of practice to mentally watch that and calmly drink coffee without panicking and not following your stop loss or grabbing at small profits when it gets back positive.     i will say...traders run their scanners all day looking for gappers or stocks that are going to move that day.  when all you need to do is pick 3-4 stocks/etf’s like aapl or amd or spy that have high volume options with 1 or 2 cents spreads that all move 100% or more every single day and just watch those few stocks.   all you need to do is learn about the options, have above average discipline....and get the direction right.](/r/daytrading/comments/tln4un/capital_for_day_trading/i1zpwof/)

1648255369,"i don’t know how or why you’re getting upvoted. apple today is worth nearly 3 trillion dollars. it’s the most valuable company on earth. their 2021 yearly revenue would put them around #40th in gdp if they were a country. to say they have a “big pile of cash” is like saying “the sun is kinda hot”.

they have a ton of differentiated revenue streams. mobile devices, set top boxes, advertising, cloud and content services, the app store, accessories to name a few. they own one of the key platforms that other major tech companies rely deeply on - see what happened to facebook/meta stock when apple changed how they handled ad tracking on ios. apple basically helped wipe 230 billion market cap off of meta in one day. that’s how powerful they are. they could stop selling desktop and laptop computers altogether and still print money - macs make up approx 10-15% of their revenue.

this has nothing to do with what you personally think about their products. the fact you think there’s any comparison between where they were in the late 90s and now is insane. not to mention how much more deeply technology is embedded in our lives than it was back then. i’m sure they are making mistakes, but their mistakes have 0 to do with what they did in their past. they’re not playing in the same league, they’re not even playing the same sport. their strategy today has 0 to do with their strategy in the 90s.

1648256003,"my process has been changing a little recently... with a company like $fb or $googl, my analysis is more focused on current valuation in respect to their moat -- in both cases, i'm confident that they will be doing just fine over the next 5, even 10 years, without calculating their cash flows. the fact that they are so profitable, have such strong moats, and are simply so *huge...* and can buy back shares on dips... is enough for me.

for a hedge like $xom, i simply tell myself: this company never dilutes, serves as an oil inflation hedge (something i'm very worried about, as my career capital is entirely in tech), and even if i'm wrong for 20 years, they will still pay a fantastic-to-me dividend yield of 5%

edit: where i do 3-5 year projections, is with growth stocks -- it is risky but i think it is basically is the best way to value a high-conviction growth stock. but, you have to do some in-depth qualitative analysis to have faith that your growth projections are in the ballpark for a secular story. examples from my portfolio would include $meli (which i need to review my valuation work), $upst, $roku.",2,,liquidamber_h,0

1648259425,"you could regex it:

    ps c:\&gt; '2.13.652.0' -replace '\.[^.]+$'
    2.13.652

which literally says ""trim the dot and anything which isn't a dot, to the end of the string"". and since there can't be more dots to the end of the string, it locks it to the last dot.

----

or classic string methods, search back from the end looknig for a dot, and trim the string up to that position:

    ps c:\&gt; $v = '2.13.652.0'
    ps c:\&gt; $v.substring(0, $v.lastindexof('.'))
    2.13.652

(nb. this will error if there are no dots in the string).

----

but it seems possible to cast them into a `[version]` type, and from there you can't change anything, but you can turn them back into strings with only some of the values; sooo:

    ps c:\&gt; [version]$v1 = '2.13.652.0'
    ps c:\&gt; $v1 = $v1.tostring(3)
    2.13.652

so you could do some weird:

    $text1 = '2.13.652.0'
    $text2 = '2.13.652'

    $ver1 = ($text1 -as [version]).tostring(3) -as [version]

[i still think nvda is years ahead of any realistic competition. especially in ai, where pretty much if you want to use industry standard tools, nvidia is your best if not only option.  like you could argue apple and amd and even intel are catching up, but even a generational leap for the competition would still put them behind nvidia's cutting edge in raw power -- completely ignoring the developer tooling, experience, and support that nvidia also has been also pushing hard. don't get me wrong, amd and apple are doing excellent in the value and power efficiency categories. i just think they're more than a generation away from competing with nvidia's current best in all categories, and nvidia isn't exactly sitting on their laurels through all this.  especially since companies like lucid are signing deals with nvidia. that's not just because of their hardware expertise, it's also due to their ai experience especially in self-driving processors. it's gonna take way more than a new chip from amd, intel or apple to put nvidia at any sort of disadvantage -- they'd also need significant investments in tooling and engineer mindshare at the very minimum. that stuff takes years to build up.  until any of those factors change, i don't think nvidia is at a disadvantage or at risk for a reversal. its current products are hilariously underpriced and perpetually sold out. they could double the price across the board to get their margin back and the people who need these will still buy them. if anything i think they're undervalued given how specialized their products are for ai and cutting edge graphics and the lack of any meaningful competition.](/r/stocks/comments/tn8tod/tesla_google_apple_amazon_spotify_whats_the_next/i21r6tb/)

that said: apple did recently release an update for the video drivers on some macs, to support the new studio display. so it might be worth it to revert to your original apple drivers and then pull up apple's software update control panel in windows; you may find that you can get a pretty decent set of drivers that way.",2,,zarmanto,0

if bill does not have a lot of cash, he will be forced to sell a huge amount of his shares in microsoft to pay the tax. and because of that,  now he is also losing the control of microsoft because of his sell off.

so what’s the message here? if your company share price becomes too high, you lose the company? remember, bill can’t control the price of microsoft stock since it’s all being controlled by mr. market.

you can mitigate inflation easily with stables, you'll retain purchasing power while others lose it in tradfi even if you dont make a profit or even suffer a tiny amount of relative decrease. if inflation runs utterly out of control market will crash like fuck anyway when fed realise recession is inevitable and no point trying to save the market. if inflation comes down, you'll still get a good entry anyway because this is crypto the market crashes like every 3 weeks or some shit, just have patience and good entries will present themselves, not 10k above the market rallying off the fed announcing they were doing exactly what everyone expected them to do. 

think taking a small amount of capital and trying to outperform market with some trades is a better idea than just throwing it all at the big caps and assuming they'll hold their value. atm the boring arse stock market is either trying to break down or break up, so either you want all your money out of assets or you want to be scoring on the stock market, nobody cares about internet money when there's cheap microsoft stock on the table, that or all assets are toxic and the dominoes are falling and crypto falls hardest of all. most outcomes look at best kinda boring for crypto for a bit, wait for nasdaq to get bullish but under a controlled rise, then maybe people will care about crypto again.",3,,Iksf,0

[i still think nvda is years ahead of any realistic competition. especially in ai, where pretty much if you want to use industry standard tools, nvidia is your best if not only option.  like you could argue apple and amd and even intel are catching up, but even a generational leap for the competition would still put them behind nvidia's cutting edge in raw power -- completely ignoring the developer tooling, experience, and support that nvidia also has been also pushing hard. don't get me wrong, amd and apple are doing excellent in the value and power efficiency categories. i just think they're more than a generation away from competing with nvidia's current best in all categories, and nvidia isn't exactly sitting on their laurels through all this.  especially since companies like lucid are signing deals with nvidia. that's not just because of their hardware expertise, it's also due to their ai experience especially in self-driving processors. it's gonna take way more than a new chip from amd, intel or apple to put nvidia at any sort of disadvantage -- they'd also need significant investments in tooling and engineer mindshare at the very minimum. that stuff takes years to build up.  until any of those factors change, i don't think nvidia is at a disadvantage or at risk for a reversal. its current products are hilariously underpriced and perpetually sold out. they could double the price across the board to get their margin back and the people who need these will still buy them. if anything i think they're undervalued given how specialized their products are for ai and cutting edge graphics and the lack of any meaningful competition.](/r/stocks/comments/tn8tod/tesla_google_apple_amazon_spotify_whats_the_next/i21r6tb/)

1648406597,"idk what other etfs you're looking at so i'm just going to consider vti, voo, spy. i wouldn't really consider any of these to be tech heavy. vti is the whole us market. voo and spy are large companies in the usa - i think this covers about 80% of the market. (this is basically true but technically idk if vti holds every public company in the us but it's good enough and sp500 holds 500 companies). if voo, spy, vti are tech heave then it's only because the us economy is tech heavy.

since these are basically the same i think you should just pick one. it probably doesn't matter what one you pick really. i would probably favor vti because because it holds smaller cap companies therefore increasing diversification. warren buffett recommends sp500 indexes. one might  argue that it's better to avoid the smaller companies because they're as well established. 

something important to realize is that holding multiple etfs doesn't necessarily increase diversification. in you're example you own both voo and spy which both have the same underlying holdings. this is like holding apple stock in your robin hood account and more apple in your tda account. you still just own apple so you're not diversified. 

""i plan to possibly sell off some of the etfs and focus on 1-2 etfs per industry. tech, energy, oil, etc. is this a smart move?""

not really unless you have a specific belief on a certain industry. etfs like spy are already diversified across all industries so adding a lot of etfs in different industries you'll just recreate something approaching spy &amp; you won't be more diversified. the exception is if you really believe in a specific industry. ex. lets say i'm investing in america and i want to be diversified but i also really believe semiconductors will do especially well. i could invest in 60% spy and 40% soxx. spy will hold some of the same stocks as soxx, but by adding soxx i'm diversified with a bias towards semiconductors.",3,,---Tim---,0

the developing human: clinically oriented embryology, 6th ed. keith l. moore, ph.d. &amp; t.v.n. persaud, md., (philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1998), 2-18:

""[the zygote] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. a zygote is the beginning of a new human being. human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. this highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.""

from human embryology &amp; teratology, ronan r. o'rahilly, fabiola muller, (new york: wiley-liss, 1996), 5-55:

""fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... the zygote ... is a unicellular embryo..""
essentials of human embryology, william j. larsen, (new york: churchill livingstone, 1998), 1-17:

""in this text, we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes, which will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual. ... fertilization takes place in the oviduct ... resulting in the formation of a zygote containing a single diploid nucleus. embryonic development is considered to begin at this point... this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""

human embryology, 3rd ed. bradley m. patten, (new york: mcgraw hill, 1968), 43:

""it is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""
keith l. moore, the developing human: clinically oriented embryology, 7th edition. philadelphia, pa: saunders, 2003. pp. 16, 2:

inflation is relevant in that (rounding a fair bit) if inflation is 10% then this is not even a real ""salary increase"" for the next 4 years. so it's not an increase in lifestyle, even.

and if you work for faang at this level then you can likely already get a better paid job in finance.

[idk what other etfs you're looking at so i'm just going to consider vti, voo, spy. i wouldn't really consider any of these to be tech heavy. vti is the whole us market. voo and spy are large companies in the usa - i think this covers about 80% of the market. (this is basically true but technically idk if vti holds every public company in the us but it's good enough and sp500 holds 500 companies). if voo, spy, vti are tech heave then it's only because the us economy is tech heavy.  since these are basically the same i think you should just pick one. it probably doesn't matter what one you pick really. i would probably favor vti because because it holds smaller cap companies therefore increasing diversification. warren buffett recommends sp500 indexes. one might  argue that it's better to avoid the smaller companies because they're as well established.   something important to realize is that holding multiple etfs doesn't necessarily increase diversification. in you're example you own both voo and spy which both have the same underlying holdings. this is like holding apple stock in your robin hood account and more apple in your tda account. you still just own apple so you're not diversified.   ""i plan to possibly sell off some of the etfs and focus on 1-2 etfs per industry. tech, energy, oil, etc. is this a smart move?""  not really unless you have a specific belief on a certain industry. etfs like spy are already diversified across all industries so adding a lot of etfs in different industries you'll just recreate something approaching spy &amp; you won't be more diversified. the exception is if you really believe in a specific industry. ex. lets say i'm investing in america and i want to be diversified but i also really believe semiconductors will do especially well. i could invest in 60% spy and 40% soxx. spy will hold some of the same stocks as soxx, but by adding soxx i'm diversified with a bias towards semiconductors.](/r/stocks/comments/tpo82w/a_lot_of_my_etfs_are_tech_heavy_should_i/i2ces9w/)

[vanguard funds maybe?  it’s index or industry specific or target date/gain.   i sometimes use the stock heat map chart and check p/e, forward p/e, peg and last 3mo- ytd chart. and see if there’s anything out there that’s looks interesting from all of those.  then from that make a list and check out each individual company and see what’s up. ratings. news. industry. debt. etc.   but since everything goes down and up so crazy now, seems that regardless of anything it’s all about people’s feelings primary.  for long term maybe just managed funds or managed accounts if it’s over 50-100k. or mutual funds that have a good track record.  and sometimes it’s just placing bets. i knew amd used to be a good company competing agaisnt intel back when the stock was like $6 bucks but had fallen out of grace. when i saw news that this like triple phd lady was taking over as ceo i thought amd might go somewhere and bought thousands of shares. it paid off.   i think the future now is in robotics/ai. i see a future where amazon like warehouses will be robots only. self driving cars or drones will deliver packages.  3d printed houses or robot helping build houses. military warfare w robots. emergency services.  old care folks home companions. building electronic equipment and any repetitive tasks.  self driving planes and large ships and trucks for cargo. self driving vans to replace about 35% of the plane travel industry in the usa as people will just prefer driving 4-5 hrs instead of the same time it takes w security check in and airport hubs. robots in farming.  back end optimization for hollywood and entertainment in general.  so that’s my bet now . so far it sucks lol.](/r/stocks/comments/tpnlde/how_to_buy_in_these_market_conditions/i2cs0yp/)

[started around 29 ish still in my 30s. i stuck to mostly tech stocks as that is what i knew and understood got burned by solar stocks when they sector was red hot l, made some money but when i went long the sector tanked and like a noob i held for a few months but after seeing constant loss of what little i had left i sold and took what i would call serious losses back than. learned to look at ers and do some basic research , looked a market trends and see what company was making the right moves. things they aren’t always highlighted on a balance sheet. my picks were tech and better yet what i knew and had used - msft nvda amd aapl crm sq even after recent massive downturn have kept me very much in the green.   i have tsla a good amount  of it i don’t include it usually as i think the growth there just throws my portfolio out of whack.. like 1500% or something . tesla taught me to be a patient investor and have faith in the company and leadership regardless  of short term fluctuations or all the chaos that it has created since ipo.   in the past 2 years i have started to invest in div growth stocks and some other div stable stocks like o, abbvie ko pfizer wm v.  i have realized i am over exposed to tech and even though besides sq everything has held up decently it’s still painful to see a 15-20% drop on gains.  started with $3500 and  invested over time not regularly just when i could afford to. got married, had kids, bought our dream home.. my investments have given me a sense of financial calm and stability that helped a lot in other aspects of life like relationships, higher education and career growth.  getting close to the goal of hitting 1 million in assets between me and wifey before we hit 40.  not counting the equity in my house that already puts me over the mark, but i don’t like to include it .](/r/stocks/comments/tppm9o/investors_who_started_in_their_30s_where_are_you/i2ddadb/)

1648490550,"thanks for your amazing and quick reply! i am really very happy about it!  


&gt;*1. when you buy dtokens off the dex, where do these tokens come from? someone has to ‘create’ then right?*

ok, got it. like on an exchange, supply and demand determine the price. whereas on a dex there is no order book - so it is more difficult to look inside from the outside and ultimately, i can't set limits (like a limit order). but i can track the price externally and form an opinion. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;2. the people who are making those vaults and taking the loans are the ones ‘creating’ these tokens. they are the ones minting them.

is this really the only source to obtain dtokens? where do the tokens i can buy on cake come from? does cake take out a loan for them? how do they repay the interest costs incurred?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;3. when you mint a token through a vault/loan, they are are minted at the oracle price. oracle here is basically the service that gets external price information. so if you’re minting daapl, at the time of your loan, this token is worth the ‘real price’ of the stock - the oracle price. when you repay your loan, again the oracle price is used.

i find that interesting, thanks for the info! i thought the new dtokens are generally being traded at a premium. but it fits with the page posted here yesterday (https://dstocks-defichain.web.app/) showing the token price difference between oracle and dex price.   
  
in reverse, since all tokens have a premium (for now), wouldn't it be an almost sure deal to mint tokens via a loan and then sell them on dex (assuming sufficient liquidity of course). then surely the premium is always my profit?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;4. when you buy off the dex, you are buying based on the market price of the dex, not oracle. this will be influenced by supply and demand.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. so, if less people take loans (there is less tokens in circulation), and more people want to just buy them off the dex. what happens? low supply, high demand. price goes up. this is the ‘premium’ everyone keeps talking about.

here i still have some gaps in my knowledge (which i am currently closing by reading a lot). but does pricing via supply and demand on a dex work in exactly the same way as on a cex?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;6. the general concept is the same. everyone is trying to buy low, sell high. if the ‘premium’ is high, and oracle price is low, you can try to make some extra money by minting and selling the tokens, or just minting and putting into lm, and using the rewards to pay off the loan.

ok, that already answers my question from 3. sorry, i have read your answer several times - but respond chronologically. i'm going to play around with it: take a loan, mint dtoken with a high volume and then sell them via dex. the sales revenue should be in any case (still) higher than the ""purchase price"" when minting. then i pay back the loan and have more than before. would you agree with me?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;7. if you’re just buying off the dex, you absorb the ‘premium’ as long as your lm rewards are big enough to cover it, and as you’ve surmised, less risk from loan liquidity.

i don't find filling the premium with lm rewards very attractive. especially since the premium will probably disappear in the next few days. at the peak (nvidia stock), that's 12% premium at the moment. you won't get that much back from lm in a few days. 

from a lm strategy point of view, it would make more sense to wait and buy dtokens when the premium is gone, right?   
  
thinking further: who will actually take up a loan to have the oracel price advantage when the dtoken dex premium is gone?

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;8. there is no right and wrong of course, it is basically the economics of a free market. there is risk, there is reward. someone has to mint, someone has to buy. there must be supply and there must be demand. and price will go up or down depending on this on either side of the equation.

true words. and we all try to place ourselves somehow intelligently to take as many profits as possible with our individual risk profile.   
  
but first of all, you must understand what you are getting into.   
  
thanks for your help! i look forward to reading from you again and continuing the discussion.",4,,mesios,0

[you’re getting a lot of flak for saying this because this is a saying for short term traders/ people who don’t actually know how to invest.   there is nothing wrong with the statement itself because the statement essentially defines what a profit is (ie. the excess return above your cost, it is impossible to lose money when you make profit - just like how it’s impossible to make money when you sell for a loss). any investor that actually values a company and has conviction in their own valuation should not be actively selling just because “you can’t go broke taking profits”. if the asset is undervalued, then you buy and if it is overvalued, you sell. it is hard for investors to time the market - which is why this doesn’t apply to investors. this statement promotes the active movement of positions (selling to buy back later) which is counterproductive when you do not know the future.   for short term traders/ speculators, this is fine because these are usually people who use ta or do not anything about the company fundamentals or valued the company. if you do not have conviction of a specific value of a company, you should sell when you get a chance.   i would also argue that these sayings were dated back way before the modern days of commission free trades and were ways that the media and brokers used to encourage retail investors to actively trade (increasing their commission revenues).](/r/stocks/comments/tqjuyu/no_one_went_broke_taking_profits/i2hswmp/)

(it split 7:1 so i got lucky.). now i just see inflation, gas &amp; insurance going up and it feels good not to have to worry about rent or a car payment. 

how did i get the money to put away in apple stocks and crypto?  i'm 44 and am only driving my third new car in my life.  i only take 1-2 major vacations a year and am single no unnecessary complications.   that is to say i'm not saying i will never marry perhaps that is in my future.  i quit a full time job last year because it was getting too stressful after four years and i didn't need it and basically took the last year off.  i need to work and keep busy so i'll be starting a 100% remote support job in a few weeks no pressure.  i have about one year's salary still saved up as a cushion in addition to more crypto investments i didn't cash out and an ira i plan on contributing the max per year too.  (can't put all of your eggs in one basket.)

every time i want to buy a tesla or make a major purchase to get me into debt, i just think about it and don't.  

i've also had several big ticket curve ball emergency items come up the past two years like having to redo the incoming pipes in my house and septic tank (it's an old house) and even then i was able to do them because i had the 4-5k in the savings for each of the two jobs.",-2,,trekker182,0

the problem with holding shares in the company for which you work is that it is, in effect, putting your eggs in one basket.

consider scenario a where you sell it and dump it in a reliable etf (or divide it into some big stocks like $v, $amzn, $msft), and scenario b in which you keep it.

in scenario a, if something awful happens that drastically changes the circumstances of your company to the point where they have to make salary cuts or worse layoff jobs (including you), in scenario a you may have to find a new job, in scenario b you have to find a new job and you're probably out a significant portion of this windfall",1,,ApexVirtuoso,0

1648588307,"everyone who buys an nft is doing so because of the greater fool theory. the idea is that you buy an asset because you think you can sell that asset to someone else for more money. everyone who buys into an nft thinks they are smarter than everyone else and eventually they will sell once the rest of society figures out how great nfts are. 

this doesn't apply to most investments, at least not always. if you buy a share of apple stock and never sell it, you expect to make money from the sale of iphones. if you buy a us treasury bond, you expect the us government to pay you back some interest. if you buy a farm, you expect to make money by selling crops. the asset itself produces income.

on the flip side, you can buy things expecting to use them yourself. most commodities (e.g., oil) and options contracts are traded by people that actually need to use those products (e.g., a chicken farming company might buy calls and puts to hedge the price of chicken feed to ensure a standard price to sell to mcdonald's). even crypto can theoretically be used as a currency, just like dollar bills. 

an nft can't be used for any of these purposes. it is a collectible like a painting. the internal value is that you like looking at it. the catch with a painting is that only one person can look at it at once. nfts can be seen by anyone as a standard jpg. a photograph of the mona lisa isn't the same as the actual mona lisa, but nfts are inherently digital.

this means if you buy an nft because you appreciate it, cool. but if you buy it because you want to sell to someone else one day, you are part of the scam. once you buy it, you need to hype someone else into buying it from you. otherwise, you end up as the greatest fool. in this way, everyone who buys an nft is part of the scam and everyone who tries to sell one is also part of the scam.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/credit_card_act_of_2009

you are wrong - introduced in the house of representatives as h.r. 627 by carolyn maloney (d–ny) on january 22, 2009

it was like one of the first things dems did when claiming control of the government in 2009. the dem base sure let them know their appreciation in 2010 😂

&gt; she didn’t make any money has nothing to do with her intent.

you can only guess at intent. if she was insider trading, paul would not have held long term, and he wouldn’t have bought 10x more after the ipo as regulations were being passed by his wife.

&gt; the initial ipo -if the legislation had hit the floor that ipo would have been a disaster. they had a closed door meeting. that meeting isn’t public. that’s inside information.  then went and bought the stock. which is insider trading.

we know this is not true, given the visa stock maintained its strength after the credit card bill of rights and the no swipe fees legislation went through. again, you do not know what you are talking about.

&gt; then didn’t let the house vote on the registration. which could have partially inflated the price of the ipo. which is a direct manipulation of a security. which is corruption. not just “look bad.”

because it wouldn’t go through gwb. which is why it was quickly passed under obama. again, reigning in credit card companies was one of the first things pelosi and the dems did.

&gt; it looked so bad that when the insider information law came to pass they wanted to make sure there was a “pelosi clause.” because of that incident. which is cheap political theatre. but it happened and it strengthened their case to point fingers. even if i m sure the republican party has done far worse.

is this just admission that this is all about optics?

let’s review. you gone from making very specific claims on insider trading that were shown to be misinformation. after all of this, we have essentially gotten to “yeah but this is bad optics and let republicans make her look bad”.  and you aren’t going to stop and reflect on the transition?

of course burgum didn't own all of great plains, but somewhere around 25%. not sure on the math or what it was per share, but that's like 25 million shares of microsoft. if burgum got 25% of that, it's 6 million shares and he would have been worth 1/4 billion 20+ years ago. today, 6 million shares of microsoft stock is worth 1.8 billion. just the dividends alone on that is nuts.

1648760308,"target selection during the great terror has received a lot of attention over the past 20 years as large amounts of material has been released by the fsb’s central and regional archives, as well as the almost total declassification of police materials in ukraine and georgia. in the interest of simplicity, i’ll focus on the “kulak operation”, nkvd order no. 00447, which was launched in july-august 1937 against a wide variety of different targets across the country. 

in this operation regional departments of the nkvd (hereon written as unkvd) targeted “kulaks”, criminals, and other enemies based on criteria handed down from moscow and categorized them as 1 (to be shot) or 2 (to be imprisoned) based on their “danger” to society. after a brief investigation, troikas composed of the unkvd chief, regional party leader, and procurator would sentence victims *in absentia* without trial, usually judging dozens or hundreds of cases at a time. 

from the start, the operation by design *regionalized* target selection, investigation, and sentencing, as had occurred with the first “kulak operation” launched in early 1930 during collectivization. moscow gave the troikas final authority for sentencing without review or appeal, though it continued to give instructions on which population groups to focus on and which to exclude from troika judgments. 

because of the number of categories sent from moscow and their vagueness, the nkvd’s local departments chose targets based primarily on local needs and demographics. some districts focused on petty criminals, others individual farmers who hadn’t joined the collective farm, other industrial and defense enterprises, and others still local religious groups and their followers. the nkvd correctly interpreted the operation as a chance to conduct a broad social cleansing of all “enemies”, resolving social and economic problems using mass repression. 

**laying the groundwork**

while the methodological/ideological origins of the “kulak operation” began much earlier, its bureaucratic genesis started in summer 1937. on july 2, 1937, stalin sent a telegram to all regional party and unkvd leaders to compile lists of ""kulaks and criminals"", to be shot or exiled by troikas depending on how inveterately ""anti-soviet"" they were: (1)

&gt;it has been noticed that most of the former kulaks and criminals who were deported at one time from different regions to the northern and siberian regions, and then after the expiration of the expulsion period, returned to their regions, are the main instigators of all kinds of anti-soviet and sabotage crimes, both in collective farms and state farms, as well as in transport and in some areas of industry.

&gt;the central committee of the all-union communist party of bolsheviks invites all secretaries of regional and *krai* organizations and all regional, *krai* and republican representatives of the nkvd to register all kulaks and criminals who have returned to their homeland so that the most hostile of them are immediately arrested and shot in the order of administrative procedure of their cases through troikas, and the rest of the less active, but still hostile elements would be exiled at the direction of the nkvd.

&gt;the central committee of the all-union communist party of bolsheviks proposes to submit to the central committee within five days the composition of the troikas, as well as the number of those to be shot, as well as the number of those to be deported. 

yezhov, people's commissar for internal affairs, sent out his own telegram the following day directing regional nkvd leaders to: (2)

&gt;upon receipt of this, take into account all the kulaks and criminals who have settled in your region, who returned after serving their sentences and fled from the camps and exile.

further on, he ordered all kulaks and criminals be categorized in the same manner as stalin's telegram directed. data collection was supposed to be completed by july 8th. 

the telegram immediately received a variety of responses asking that the upcoming repressions be extended to different target groups which were nearly always approved. for example: (3)

&gt;agree with the proposal of the central committee of turkmenistan to include repression and expulsion of members of the [nationalist counterrevolutionary] organizations ""turkmen - azatlygi"", muslim clergy, etc., instructing the nkvd to determine the number to be shot and deported.

other approved requests included adding harvest-related sabotage and espionage, gulag inmates, various “counterrevolutionary and insurgent organizations” and families of gang members, immigrants from the western border regions, lamas and other minority religious leaders, and many other categories. (4)

requests to give the unkvd extensions on the due date for numbers to be repressed in order to collect more data were also received and approved. (5) leplevsky, people’s commissar of internal affairs for ukraine, noted in his summary of data from july 10th (2 days late already) that the donbas and dnepropetrovsk regions’ numbers of kulaks and criminals to be sentenced were incomplete and would be updated. (6)

on july 16th, the nkvd held a conference in moscow at which the parameters of the operation were discussed. regional unkvd leaders were invited to discuss problems in their areas of responsibility and present plans for the upcoming conduct of the operation. (7) the nkvd of ukraine, for example, attended the meeting with the following points of clarification: (8)

&gt;1) families of kulaks and criminals of the 1st and 2nd category.

&gt;2) should the troikas judge all those arrested in categories 1 and 2.

&gt;3) on the procedure for filing cases (in the usual manner, with the sanction of the prosecutor).

&gt;4) on the order of dispatch (in general trains, in prison cars, according to the orders of the gulag, from prisons).

&gt;5) if the family is exiled, then at the same time and in the same direction as the head of the family?

&gt;6) what is the minimum property families can take with them if they are deported?

&gt;7) how to [deal] with families that include military personnel and law enforcement?

&gt;8) whether persons with obvious signs of disability are included in the second category.

&gt;9) should kulaks who at one time evaded exile be included?

&gt;10) how to [deal with] priests who have returned from exile and are demontsrating counterrevolutionary activity.

no minutes of this meeting have been found, but testimony from participants as well as what was repeated in subsequent meetings between unkvd leaders and their own subordinates in late july and early august suggests a broad outline. along with presentation of operational plans and clarification of key questions, which outlined the procedure for the operation, yezhov likely also approved the use of torture at the conference. regional meetings of the unkvd over the following weeks repeated that physical coercion was sanctioned. (9)

again quoting leplevsky, local nkvd leaders were expected to have complete data of target groups brought to moscow by this point: (10)

&gt; you must arrive in moscow for the meeting by 7/16, having the plan of operation and all accounting materials in your hands.

however, as the operational plan for ukraine drawn up before the conference notes, full accounting of all targets was still incomplete. it also provides a useful window into how initial targets were determined: (11)

&gt;when preparing an operation against kulaks and criminals, widely use materials on kulaks, members of various religious sects, contacts of foreign consulates, persons sued for espionage, recipients of ""hitler aid"" [nazi food aid to ethnic german farmers in the ussr during the 1931-33 famine], former political bandits.

thus, for the first wave of arrests, the unkvd intended to use their existing card catalogue of enemies to carry out mass arrests of those they already had registered. this is confirmed by materials from other regions, discussed later.

1648760499,"u/arrogant_ambassador similar directives continued to appear throughout the month of august to push the ukrainian nkvd (and presumably, other unkvd) in the direction preferred by moscow. at the end of the month, additional criticism was sent to all unkvd about the lack of reports on group cases and uncovered conspiracies, as well as demands for concrete reports about how the operation’s arrests had reduced “negative manifestations” in the economy and society (industrial and agricultural accidents, opposition to the soviet government, etc.). (16) as most unkvd (with some regional exceptions, such as kharkiv) had pursued individual rather than group cases using their own materials, the demand for reports on group cases was a push towards expanding the scope of repression to “uncover” new enemies. (17)

as noted in leplevsky’s circular and subsequent documents, moscow took a keen interest in trying to control target selection and ensuring the unkvd used the troikas appropriately, with mixed success as ukraine’s example shows. at the same time, it’s clear that moscow’s “guidance” encouraged the unkvd to show some discrimination when choosing who to arrest, as well as which categories they should be assigned to. 

in the shugurovsky district of the tatar assr, for example, we have a list of 35 “kulaks and criminals who returned from exile and detention, first category” from the local nkvd department. all of them were from just 6 villages, and only two were identified as exiled or having fled to avoid exile in the early 1930s – another 4 were identified as “socially harmful”. 14 had minor criminal records for theft and hooliganism, while 16 had no indication of “anti-soviet activities” beyond their background (individual farmers, family of kulaks or merchants, etc.). none fit the definitions established by moscow for immediate repression. (18)

despite being identified as those to be repressed in the first category (re: shot immediately as serious threats), none of those listed were punished via troikas under order 00447. one was arrested in december and convicted via the court system. at least in the initial stages of the “kulak operation”, those who did not fit the characteristic dictated by moscow in the tatar assr were weeded out.  the chistopol operational group followed a similar process, identifying 600 names to be convicted in the second category by july 28th but weeding out 408 of those by august 13th. (19)

one thing that should become clear is the obvious contradictory impulses encouraged by the central nkvd’s directive. each region was expected to convict “appropriate” targets via the troikas, use effective tactics to expose enemies (undercover work, informants, surveillance, etc.), and give moscow detailed information about its work. yet constant demands to target a wider array of groups, preference for group cases by the central nkvd (which had a much lower evidentiary standard), and the large number of arrests and convictions expected all pushed the unkvd toward indiscriminate mass repression. 

there has been some academic debate over whether the intent of stalin was to make the “limits” a maximum or a minimum for each region. the documents of the 8th (statistical) department of the gugb seem to interpret them as minimum goals to be achieved: (20)

&gt;as can be seen from these data, the troikas under the nkvd work most intensively in the kiev, odessa and vinnitsa regions. in the kiev and vinnitsa regions, the number of convicts in category 1 is approaching the established limit, in the odessa region it even exceeds the limit. in kiev and odessa regions, the number of convicts in the 2nd category is also the largest.

&gt;the troikas under the nkvd for the kharkiv region and the nkvd massr are lagging behind - those convicted in category 1 do not even make up 50% of the limit, while the number of those convicted in category 2 is generally insignificant.

with mass arrests of party and nkvd leaders ongoing, the push to fulfill (and overfulfill) the numbers assigned by moscow was a matter of life and death. 

along with directives on the conduct of the operation which influenced target selection, the central leadership also issued a number of circulars emphasizing particular target groups to be dealt with. 

on august 7, 1937, an nkvd circular provided additional clarification about which criminal elements should be prosecuted: (21)

&gt;(1) criminals who committed armed and violent robbery;

&gt;(2) repeat offenders who were prosecuted for stealing livestock, street robbery, drunkards and harboring criminals, as well as keepers of brothels;

&gt;(3) recidivists and criminals who escaped from places of detention;

&gt;(4) recidivists and criminals without a fixed place of residence, evading socially useful labor, who, although not accused of a specific crime, still maintain ties with the criminal subculture. 

operations against minor criminals, under the broad rubric of ""socially dangerous elements"", were integral to the general social cleansing order 00447 was to carry out. evidence has shown that throughout the 1930s the division between ""political"" and ""non-political"" crimes significantly blurred, especially as in 1930 the criminal police had been completely subordinated to the political police. 

while the norm was to obtain confessions in cases before conviction, this doesn’t seem to have been a set rule for every province. in kalinin province and the moldovan assr, for example, over 90% of cases did not include any confession of guilt. nor was it a requirement in other regions – individuals were regularly convicted based solely on their social background/recidivism or, in group cases, association with other individuals who had confessed (and often, were forced to accuse others as well). the inter-district operational groups worked extensively with party leaders, employers, and “character witnesses” (professional witnesses under the nkvd’s employ) who would sign accusations against lists of targets and point out targets (bad workers, critics, etc.) for the nkvd to add. (22)

**implementation**

for each target of order 00447, their experience depended both on the guidance discussed above as well as the specific regional characteristics. 

in altai krai, many of those targeted were individual farmers who had refused to join the collective farm. repression combined with other measures (higher taxes, land restrictions, etc.) was used to eliminate the individual sector entirely. in several district in october-november 1937, the collective farms which had seen the slowest progress in gathering the harvest and meeting their procurement quotas were the main targets of repression, with targets chosen within those farms based on their social background. repression was specifically targeted to resolve immediate economic and social problems, terrorizing peasants into joining the collective farm and meeting their procurement quotas. (23)

the exhaustion of the initial contingents under surveillance during the first month of the operation and the push by the center to “uncover” new enemies led to the increased falsification of data by the unkvd in order to secure convictions. in altai, 24% of troika convictions in august for “former kulaks” were for individuals who were in fact not kulaks at all. this rose to 30% in october-november and 70% by march 1938. usually they were classified as “hidden kulaks” or “uncovered kulaks” when, by all accounts, they had only ever been poor or middle farmers who in some way offended the local authorities. the highest proportions of falsifications occurred near the planned “end” of the operation when limits remained unfulfilled (in december-january and march).

also, how do you suppose this will affect those of us who haven't been able to drs some of our shares? my only experience with this was my partner's apple stock split via rh forever ago. he still reaped some of the benefits, but i'm curious if anyone has ideas?",2,,PoeticSplat,0
1648762484,"it should be like any broker account. when a stock splits, you just magically wake up with a higher number of shares in your account. 

seen it a few times with my apple stock. i got worried when i checked the price of apple, then looked at my account, same value, just more shares. it really freaked 18 year old me out
