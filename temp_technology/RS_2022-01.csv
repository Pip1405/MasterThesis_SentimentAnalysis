1641976095,removal of apple stock apps from x device using profiles,"Hi all,

I'm trying to remove the FindMy app from my daughters iPod Touch (Apple allow any family member to activate lock mode on any device, which for a 6 year olds device is quite silly).

I've created a configuration profile using Apple Configurator 2 which I have installed on the device, but its not removing the app.

I served up the mobileconfig file using a webserver which I then manually installed using settings on the device.

Does anyone know this may not be working?

1643304150,"mastercard stock slips on earnings, but american express jumps 9%"," 

#### Key points:

* Mastercard stock dropped 2% despite positive earnings
* An increase in consumer spending, particularly travel, is returning to pre-pandemic levels
* In a big week for payment providers, Mastercard's earnings appear diminished next to American Express's $12.1B revenue, sending stock surging 9%

This is a big week for investors who are looking at payment providers; with American Express, Mastercard, and Visa all reporting earnings. During the height of the pandemic, payment providers felt the tightening of the economic landscape through a wavering of consumer spending – however, with American Express posting strong results yesterday, and Mastercard beating estimates today – it seems that consumer spending is starting to bounce back.

Mastercard’s (NYSE: MA) Q4 net income rose to $2.38B from $1.79B, or $2.41 per share from $1.78. Adjusted, Mastercard earned $2.35 per share compared to $1.64 the previous year; beating consensus at $2.21. The company reported a revenue of $5.22B, showing a $4.12B increase year-on-year, beating a general estimate of $5.17B.

On another note, the company saw cross-border volume rising 53%, with cross-border spending back to pre-pandemic levels; a great sign for the payment provider that traditional spending habits are returning. 

However, looking at Mastercard stock; investors remained apprehensive, despite the news on cross-border spending returning to pre-pandemic levels on the return of the travel buzz. Inflationary woes might be playing a part in the absence of bulls this morning, perhaps concerned about levels of domestic spending moving forward; pushing MA stock down roughly 2% in early trading.

Looking over to American Express (NYSE: AXP), it seems to be a similar narrative, yet there are a few stand-out financials that investors might want to pay attention to. Most importantly, the company has chosen to serve a specific market segment, and it seems to be working incredibly well.

American Express posted revenue of $12.1B at a quarterly increase of 30%, more than double the revenue of Mastercard for a smaller market slice. The market reacted positively, with the stock surging around 9%. It seems that AMEX’s strategy is infallible at the moment; and strategy-wise, the company seems like a more valuable investment.",8,0,Asktraders178,StocksAndTrading

“Visa Inc. topped $7 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, buoyed by a quicker-than-expected resumption in travel spending and sustained growth in categories like e-commerce that had been strong throughout the pandemic.

The company generated fiscal first-quarter net income of $4.0 billion, or $1.83 a share, up from $3.1 billion, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Visa V earned $1.81 a share. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.70 in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share.

Visa’s revenue rose to $7.06 billion from $5.69 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $6.79 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet weren’t expecting Visa to cross the $7 billion revenue mark until the June quarter.

Payments volume rose 20%, while processed transactions increased 21%. The company saw a 51% increase in cross-border volume when excluding intra-Europe transactions and a 40% bump in overall cross-border volume.”",114,15,randomaccount0923,stocks

1643482755,visa stock price jumps 5% on strong e-commerce &amp; travel return," 

#### Key points:

* Visa stock jumps 5% on positive Q1 earnings
* Strong growth in e-commerce and a resurgance in travel were key benefactors this quarter
* Visa posted net revenue of $7.1B at an increase of 24%

Following American Express and Mastercard, Visa (NYSE: VISA) was the last to report earnings this week. The company’s Q1 report was received well by investors; with stock price currently showing a premarket gain of just over 5%. 

It has been a mixed week for the payment providers. American Express posted a steller revenue of over $12B, sending the stock soaring early in the week, yet Mastercard’s earnings were interpreted much more negatively, with price action driving the stock down around 2%. 

Looking across the earnings reports; similar trends vouch for an improving economic landscape, with a gradual shift in post-pandemic consumer spending providing a clearer picture of a return back to traditional spending habits. 

Visa recorded growth across various sectors; payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth all accelerated on a year-on-year basis – but it was the strong growth in e-commerce and a resurgence in international travel that bolstered the company’s Q1.

With a defiant Covid outlook, the company doesn’t expect rising cases to deflect an increase in international travel in the coming quarter, meaning that we might be a further increase from an already impressive 40% increase in cross-border volume. 

Visa posted net revenue of $7.1B at a rise of 24%, while net profit also improves 25% to $3.9B.
