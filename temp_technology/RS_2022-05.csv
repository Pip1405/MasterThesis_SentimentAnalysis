1652274675,nvidia stock: new growth areas to secure its future,"Cloud providers and household-name technology companies were hit hard last Thursday. This caused hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization to evaporate in a single day and pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to its biggest one-day decline since 2020. Investors reacted to last week's Fed rate hike with a frenzy of selling, pushing down growth-driving sectors like technology and health care.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the current market problems, I continue to be bullish on NVIDIA ($NVIDIA([NVDA.US](https://NVDA.US))$).

&amp;#x200B;

Nvidia is a company that specializes in the manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs). It is also a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. It has been working with artificial intelligence for more than 20 years and helping to make it easier for everyone to use.

&amp;#x200B;

Nvidia's GPU technology can help companies that want to use AI but don't have the resources or expertise to build their own hardware.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, Nvidia is playing an important role in the transition to Web 3.0, a term used to describe the future of the Internet. This is an important area of economic investment that will be supported by companies such as Nvidia.

&amp;#x200B;

The company is very profitable and has seen significant growth in revenue and free cash flow over the past few years. The value of this company should continue to grow rapidly. Therefore, the current decline seems like it could prove to be a good buying opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

NVIDIA's New Growth Areas

So far, INVISTA's stock has fallen sharply this year. Investors can take advantage of this opportunity as NVIDIA can maintain the performance of the last few years and the growth of its gaming division sales revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

NVIDIA is one of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies. Nvidia's latest products include Xavier, an AI chip that powers self-driving cars.

&amp;#x200B;

To stay competitive in the increasingly popular and disruptive field of artificial intelligence, Nvidia has been investing in making its products cheaper. As the focus on the automotive market shifts, opportunities for significant revenue generation will open up.

&amp;#x200B;

Gaming is now a large part of NVIDIA's revenue. The division has grown significantly, contributing nearly $12.5 billion in sales for fiscal year 2022 (46% of NVIDIA's revenue), and investors don't seem too worried about the future. There is a huge market of people interested in gaming.

&amp;#x200B;

The opportunities in the automotive space are much greater. In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA's automotive business will generate just $566 million in revenue, representing just over 2% of its total sales. In addition, the automotive business grew only 6% last year compared to NVIDIA's gaming business.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors should take into account that NVIDIA is a well-known company in the gaming industry. It started selling graphics cards to high-end PCs and gaming consoles decades ago. NVIDIA has a firm grip on the graphics card market, controlling about 80% of the market. This may not last forever, but the outlook for NVIDIA is strong.

Bottom Line on NVDA Stock

NVIDIA has just announced that they are now a three-chip company and now have a larger portfolio of products. As both processors become more common, the demand for NVIDIA products will increase as the company becomes the preferred GPU choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Management has had significant success recently and has made many important decisions that will affect the future of the business. NVDA stock may fit into the portfolios of many investors.",1,0,Otto_Bess,u_Otto_Bess

1652727158,$aapl - 'big short' investor michael burry reveals bet against apple stock ‚Äî and built stakes in alphabet and meta last quarter,"[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5)

 

Michael Burry, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame, placed a bet against [Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) and loaded up on other stocks last quarter, a [Securities and Exchange Commission filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761922010747/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml) revealed on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management held bearish put options against 206,000 Apple shares as of March 31. The iPhone maker's stock price has roughly quadrupled since the start of 2019, but has slumped by 16% this quarter alone.

Scion held only six stocks at the end of December. The hedge fund exited all of those holdings except Bristol-Myers Squibb last quarter, but added the likes of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Discovery to its portfolio.

The slew of purchases helped to boost the total value of Scion's US stocks (excluding options) by 122% to $165 million. The fund's largest long positions as of March 31 were a $22 million stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb, roughly $19 million stakes in Booking Holdings and Discovery, and a $18 million stake in Alphabet.

Scion didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.

It's worth noting that Burry [trumpeted Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-spotted-apple-warren-buffett-stock-investment-2021-3-1030186770?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) as a stock worthy of Warren Buffett in 1999 ‚Äî about 17 years before the Berkshire Hathaway CEO invested in the company. Berkshire now counts Apple as the number-one holding in its stock portfolio, and Buffett [recently revealed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-annual-shareholder-meeting-charlie-munger-stocks-2022-4?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) he added to his company's own position last quarter.

Burry is [best known](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-gamestop-crypto-crash-2022-1?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) for calling and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, [paving the way](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-investor-michael-burry-scion-gamestop-stock-price-frenzy-2021-2-1030050393?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) for the meme-stock craze by investing in GameStop and penning letters to the video-game retailer's board, and [betting against](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets) Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund last year.

Over the past two years, Burry has singled out Tesla, GameStop, bitcoinn, dogecoinn, Robinhood, and the white-hot US housing market as examples of speculative excess in financial markets.
