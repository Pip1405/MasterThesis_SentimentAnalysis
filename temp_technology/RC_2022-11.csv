1667262043,"this is only because you're implementing the strategy naively. when you borrow against the asset, you should also open an offsetting hedge position that prevents you from retaining the exposure while still allowing you to defer the capital gains. this can require some management, but will work just fine.

e.g. if you own 100 shares of aapl stock and want 10 shares worth of dollars against them - open a 10 share short position. now your net exposure is neutral, and you can easily close the offsetting positions at a wash if you need to.",1,,darawk,0

1667267773,"seriously his comments were just modern astrology. the reason meta stock absolutely cratered is because costs are going up uncontrolled and much faster than revenue
- users are up which is good
- apple and the recession cost them a ton of revenue perhaps 10 billion and added cost for them to add other predictive tech
- they spent 10 billion a year on vr and next year is even more without a much revenue
- they invest a ton into machine learning to compete with tiktok on reels delivery

… 2023 will not fun for them but they make a shitton of money and could fix the cost issues in a day ( by killing the metaverse ) so to me the share price seems a bit extreme.",-1,,klauskinski79,0
1667267874,"that facebook video is now 10 years old, back when future earnings will still largely speculative. i actually think there's a decent chance that buffett/berkshire takes a big position in meta within the next year or two, if zuck finds religion on capital allocation.

buff daddy loved local newspapers because they dominated local ad spend, which is historically less cyclical than advertising expenditure as a whole. meta displaced newspapers and now maintains a lock on smb ad spend, which comprises some 70% of its revenue. by any measure, shares are at a value multiple, much like $aapl was in 2013.

$goog is probably on the radar, but it's not at a value multiple. there's also too much sbc, they've barely shrunk the float even with all of their buybacks (also an issue at $meta). buffett was buying $aapl in size at something like 15x earnings, all while cook has been steadily reducing shares outstanding.

that said, matthew ball - one of the world's foremost metaverse thinkers (and the author of the great business book ""the metaverse"") - occasionally speaks with zuck and is bullish on the company's efforts. so there's that.

nobody has any idea about the future use cases of vr/ar. i think that fixed display hardware (computer monitors, tv sets, etc) will diminish dramatically over time in favor of headsets that can show multiple 'screens', which is probably why zuck/meta are focusing on capturing enterprise customers. but again, that's just my speculation. and even if that turns out to be true, we don't know that vr headsets won't just be another low-margin, commoditized consumer electronic like a television set or a pc. 

&gt;the focus is always on the metaverse.

i think you can wait for something similar to happen here. like cook, zuck won't give the market everything it wants, but he'll likely cede at least *some* ground on the capital allocation issue. we'll probably also see a prominent investor get involved within the next year or two. icahn, david einhorn, hell maybe even buffett. as we emerge from the recession, meta's core ad tech business will resume its upward trajectory, despite fears of a slowdown.

maybe i've got that wrong... but that's my understanding... it's an ""investment"" that literally disappears when you die.  

contrast that with a stock you buy, let's say you bought $50,000 of microsoft stock (or whichever), if you never sold that stock in your lifetime, you have no capital gains, if you leave it to your heirs,  
they would benefit from a stepped up basis on the valuation at your death.  if you absolute had to borrow against it (like a whole like policy contemplates) you could borrow on the stock as a margin loan.

the **independent, fee-based** part of the above advice is really important btw. don't pay someone 1% of your net worth to manage your money, and don't hire someone whose job it is to sell you certain investments (no edward jones). pay a one-time fee in exchange for a financial plan you can implement yourself.",3,,netopiax,0

they intentionally defrauded people by selling booster packs for a rare item, just to devalue it later. the people who purchased the mount bought it with the assumption (correctly) that it would remain valuable. blizzard never made any indication that they would do something like this. to be frank, old blizzard would have never done this.

for me it isn't even being angry about the mount not being rare anymore, its a principle thing. if they are going to selectively tank the value of a tcg item, i think they should make them all available in the game store for the price of all the other store mounts. keep some consistency.

they just did this for negative pr to get the game relevant and transacting on social media, its a scummy move. no such thing as bad publicity

they started out as one of the only social media platforms and absolutely decimated their predecessors.  facebook was the app for social media period. messaging, photos, videos etc, all in one app. now the sector is so fragmented with a dozen apps all doing largely the same but slightly different things in slightly different ways. with new apps coming online all the time. this is stealing screen time from facebook and advertisers know it.

i really don't like zuk but in giving him the benefit of the doubt i imagine he wasn't so stupid to miss the turning of the tides and understood facebook needed a new revenue stream. his answer was meta. i think vr will someday be a huge thing, but the tech just isn't there yet. maybe meta got out in front of it and will be best positioned to rule the day or they implode and die before the tech arrives.

my personal opinion on vr is that some new player is going to enter the market with the vr tech that everyone else has been promising but has yet delivered to us and wipe everyone else out. but we will see.

but im not with you on the last part. its mainly a hardware game from todays perspective and the one who gets the patents, gets the cake. 

its either $meta or $appl. normally i would give appl the edge, bc of their track record of delivering hardware that people are not aware that they need it (in the best way possible).

1667400551,"i mean it would only be for the absolutely massive owners but even so the math is wrong. apparentlym, 240 million iphones were sold in 2021, so if his yearly dividend is 728k, or even double that, and you divide that by 240 million iphones sold, you should get “dividends per iphone”. that math would mean like a penny at most but probably less for each iphone, a far cry from what this post says. 

that makes sense for a number of reasons. even those holding literally hundreds of millions in apple stock only own a fraction of a percent of its total ownership. considering there’s probably something like 400 dollars profit or less for each iphone after all fixed and variable expenses, including administrative expenses and such, a person with a billion invested in apple only only like .03 percent of the company and would only get .03 percent or so of that $400 profit from a single iphone. apple has a market cap of well over a trillion dollars, that’s thousands of billions to break it down.",20,,NarwhalWhich8046,0

1667402319,"the core business of meta is still growing. they have never had more users than they have today. their advertising revenue was expected to take a hit between 2021 and this year. that should have been obvious to anyone given the cash grab 2021 was for all industries. 

the biggest issue with the company is the spending on vr/ar, which i fully believe to be a smart bet. meta is in a very favorable position to be able to actually invest hoards of cash into a new venture. and it’s a venture that i believe will be clearly defined within our world in the next 5-10 years. yet it will seem to happen overnight. one day we will all be unimpressed with vr, and the next we will all be using it. kinda like the iphone. 

also, they can turn that spending off anytime they want (there were other capex items this quarter also that aren’t regular), and get back to the fcf numbers they had before. at those numbers the company is extremely undervalued. and the company requires no debt to obtain those numbers. 

i think, long term, meta is fine. there really isn’t any risk here. short term, hold onto your butts. the stock market is the most emotional place on the planet. meta could drop another 50%, then triple, then drop 50%, and so on. 

you’re judging the performance of meta stock over the course of less than one year in a total bear market. imo it’s much too soon to be seeing these “i told you so” posts.",4,,travispwingo,0

translation: meta is needlessly harming a fantastic core business in favor of a poorly-marketed, unproven concept. 

i think we can surmise that burry likes the ad tech business at the current value multiple. the problem is that the company is plowing its enormous cash flow into a speculative venture.  meta is losing money on its quest headsets, and we have no idea if vr hardware will ultimately generate economic profit. it could very well end up looking like the pc hardware business (that is, hypercompetitive and extremely low margin). 

that contrasts unfavorably with apple, which builds branded consumer products with 40% gross margins. the iphone was profitable from day 1. so it made sense that burry was buying in 1999.

1667500579,"try to look at it through the prism of the round trip. e.g. you buy 10k of apple stock pre-tax, you are in the 24% tax bracket, that means 7.6k you bought and 2.4k was bought by your partner uncle sam. if you are still in the same tax bracket when the stock is distributed and the value of the stock hasn't changed then you get back exactly what you put in, as did your uncle.

now look at the same scenario, the value of the stock falls to 5k, you do a roth conversion. you have bought out your uncle for 1.2k. then the value of the stock returns to 10k, but now it is all yours. were it distributed (in 5 years) you have 10k of stock that cost you 8.8k.

the challenge is that assumption that the tax rate hasn't changed in the intervening time period. 

were you to drop from the 24% to the 12% tax bracket over that period then in the first scenario you'd get 8.8k of stock that cost you 7.6k and your uncle got 1.2k that cost him 2.4k. in the second scenario you got 10k of stock but it cost you 8.8k and your uncle still lost 1.2k.

now instead of falling to 12% marginal tax we drop to 22% (more consistent with an 80% target income). in scenario 1 you get back 7.8k of stock at a cost of 7.6k and your uncle got 2.2k back on the original 2.4k. in scenario 2 you got 10k at the cost of 8.8k. overall you did better.

i'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to work an example where the stock subsequently went to 20k. at the end of the day there are two (almost) independently moving variables (the price of the stock and your marginal tax rate) you have to decide how to hedge your bets as in real life you won't know the price or your tax rate 30 years from now so you have to plan based on probable outcomes.",2,,CCM278,0

1667516858,"yeah, while cryptocurrency is obviously significantly more risky, even stocks have a good degree of risk (at varying levels depending on the company).

let's say you buy some apple stock right now. tomorrow, an earthquake hits the broadcom factory they use for over 50% of their production. the factory announces it will take 5 years to rebuild and get running again. apple announces they will only be able to make a fraction of the iphones they were planning to. suspicion arises that this may even result in a loss for apple, and there's a lot of uncertainty as to if they'll be able to find a new method of production anytime soon.

the stock you purchased yesterday loses a lot of value. if you bought 1 share, the loss is negligible. if you bought 100 shares, you're questioning how long it will take for the stock to go back up enough to just break even. if you bought 1000 shares, the house you were hoping to buy in a couple years with estimated profit is now nothing but a dream.

i'm not suggesting all investment strategies are subject to this level of risk, but most of these stories come from people who sold a specific company's stock before it skyrocketed, or a certain cryptocurrency before it jumped up in value.

don't invest more than you can afford to lose, both financially and emotionally. any money you have in anything other than standard currency is no longer liquid cash. it could be gone tomorrow, and if that would mean you can no longer afford the x you were planning to, rethink your investment.",2,,EpicCyndaquil,0

1667528537,"this post is 100% bullshit:

&gt; it will definitely depend on how much overall stock they have

no, it won't. the scalp-bots will buy every single 7900 xtx and xt within milliseconds of them being restocked at newegg, bestbuy, amazon, b&amp;h, etc. it will be worse than trying to buy a ps5 or xbox series x or 3080 was back in 2020, because now the scaplers are much more evolved and pervasive. there is literally a scalping *industry* now. people make their whole livings doing this, and gpus are *the* hot item. 

they will buy every single one so they can completely control the price by controlling the supply. 

$999 is a pipe-dream until at least march 2023 unless you rent a bot yourself, get lucky on launch day, have a friend who works at microcenter, or you win the game of manually refreshing bestbuy.com &amp; newegg.com all day for three months—but if you have that kind of time on your hands then you're likely not employed and not looking for a job in which case the gpu is costing you tens of thousands of dollars you could have earned simply by working that whole time!

&gt; but they have been playing it smart and lowering their older gen stuff incrementally up to this point. that has likely helped lessen the amount of old stock they have. 

this has zero effect whatsoever on how much desperate gamers will pay scalpers. 

&gt; nvidia is likely to have a lot more 30-series stock as they held off on lowering the price for longer

no, just no. 

1. you don't know how many unsold 30-series there are, nor do you know how fast or slow the retailers are able to move them. the fact their price is within $100-150 of where it was six months ago is a sign the retailers are still able to sell them for that much. it's not like any normal consumer can simply buy a 4090 for less than scalper prices of $1950-3500+. if ypur gpu budget is $1599 then a 3090 ti is still the best card you can easily get for that price. people must be paying that price, otherwise retailers would have added more rebates by now. 

also, nvidia stock is higher because they have more than four times the gpu market share of amd. 

either way, how many 30-series are left and how fast they're selling literally has zero impact on how long scalpers will control the price of 7900 gpus. the grinch isn't on team amd or team nvidia—the grinch is on team grinch, and will always scalp the most desirable new shiny things.

&gt; and now with the investigation into the melting cables 

lol. like 10-15 people *total* supposedly had this issue. then the amd shills made it into a manufactured crisis to sell radeons, cable mod l adapters, new atx 3.0 power supplies, etc. gamers nexus on youtube tested five different adapters and they all worked perfectly. mine works perfectly. many others here also have these adapters, and they work perfectly. i have never in my life seen such a ridiculous overreaction to a handful of defective items... fanboy trolling at its very worst.

&gt; they haven't been restocking the 4090 anyways.

wrong, they certainly have been restocking the 4090. best buy just got more today. many custom pc builders like cyberpowerpc.com are now backordered with weeks iof delays before they can process their backlogs of hundreds of new orders for custom 4090-based machines, particularly the more exotic overclockable varieties ones like asus rog strix. ask me how i know!

amd fanboys' fake cable-gate drama is literally having zero impact on demand and supply for 4090 gpus. 99% of people buying them do not read reddit fake drama threads or endlessly watch youtube videos of sweaty nerds arguing about which internet rumors are correct about which cables used in building extreme cutting edge, top-of-the-line pcs.

&gt; who knows what will happen

me.

&gt; but i am all for team red 

the truth at last. 

to be fair and transparent, i own two amd gpu based machines and love them. i sincerely want amd to succeed.

if you can easily find stock of 7900 gpus before feb. 1, that would mean it failed hard, and no one wants it bad enough for it to be worth the scalpers' time to control the supply. 

i'm predicting the gpu will be a big success and extremely high demand will outstrip the supply for at least a quarter, based on its displayport 2.1 support, lower power use, and number of rabid amd fanboys, and recently unemployed people with lots of spare time and money to play games for a few months.

i could be wrong but i usually am not wrong, sadly.

1. staking. look at ethereum as the backbone of web3 infrastructure. that, in and of itself, gives it a lot of value, but this system also requires validators and stakers. as i see it, ethereum staking could easily become a new type of 401k, or a long term savings account. i don't see l2s serving that purpose, because they're too use-case specific, so there will be a lot of competition amongst them (and frankly, not as secure), whereas ethereum will always be there, like tcp ip. in my opinion, the competition for l1s is already over, and ethereum has won. but we'll probably see new l2s pop up, and who knows if polygon will be able to compete.
2. ultimately, ethereum is still far more secure and decentralized than any l2. as such, people who move or store large sums in value, would probably still prefer storing it in ethereum, and convert it to an l2 token when needed. kind of similar to ethereum being your savings account, and l2 your checking account. after all, it's the base security layer for all value transfers.

turned 70k into almost half a million dollars by november 2021 (70k = years of working part-time + summers, borrowing money from my brother + government neetbux aka cerb, thank you justin trudeau).

but then the downturn came in november 2021. it was fucking bad. i made a few bad yolos and that half a million dollars turned right back into \~70k. i almost gave up. thankfully i didn't, and i changed my strategy. instead of going only max long on margin, i started to go both long and short.

played stuff like 

long: $poyyf, $sst, $thca, $asts $orgn   
short: $tsla, $lcid, $roku, $cvna, $aapl, $coin, $psny, $li, $nio

all on margin, and increasing margin as i made more money.

i might be missing a few but those are the big ones. i also tried playing bear market rallies to the best of my ability and used maximum margin at any given time.

turned the 70k right back up to 750k cad at all-time highs a few months back. now sitting on a little less than half a million dollars.

as of this second, i'm on max margin all in $asts. i have over 100k shares. if this doesn't work, i am bankrupt. lots of important news are on the way, and this stock can probably 100x in less than 10 years if all goes as planned. you heard that right. 100x. read up on it if you don't believe me and decide for yourself. this will hopefully be a trade and an investment for me.

my dream is to be a capitalist. my money to make me money.  i've seen my father work minimum wage jobs just to support our family, and i want to be able to provide a really good life for both my parents. i don't ever want to see them struggle like that again. i want to buy them a nice house and move them from this shitty rental, but houses are over a million dollars where i live. the average wage is 50k. it's just not possible. it's not fucking fair. reality is cruel.

you can't make it by ""working harder"" and ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" as boomers like to say. you can work a shit job that you hate until you're frail and senile and have nothing to show for it, or you can take a super leveraged trade and perhaps pull yourself out of the mud. and that's exactly what i will be doing.

&gt;i might be missing a few but those are the big ones. i also tried playing bear market rallies to the best of my ability and used maximum margin at any given time.
&gt;
&gt;turned the 70k right back up to 750k cad at all-time highs a few months back. now sitting on a little less than half a million dollars.
&gt;
&gt;as of this second, i'm on max margin all in $asts. i have over 100k shares. if this doesn't work, i am bankrupt. lots of important news are on the way, and this stock can probably 100x in less than 10 years if all goes as planned. you heard that right. 100x. read up on it if you don't believe me and decide for yourself. this will hopefully be a trade and an investment for me.
&gt;
&gt;my dream is to be a capitalist. my money to make me money.  i've seen my father work minimum wage jobs just to support our family, and i want to be able to provide a really good life for both my parents. i don't ever want to see them struggle like that again. i want to buy them a nice house and move them from this shitty rental, but houses are over a million dollars where i live. the average wage is 50k. it's just not possible. it's not fucking fair. reality is cruel.
&gt;
&gt;you can't make it by ""working harder"" and ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" as boomers like to say. you can work a shit job that you hate until you're frail and senile and have nothing to show for it, or you can take a super leveraged trade and perhaps pull yourself out of the mud. and that's exactly what i will be doing.

\# step response of an rl circuit  
  
date: { oct 2, 2022  
  
\---  
\## defining the step response of an rl circuit:   
the step-response of an rl circuit described the behavior of current through an inductor element while connected to a source of voltage or current.   
  
\[\[discovering the equation for step-response within an rl circuit\]\]  
  
\## time constant   
$$\\tau = \\frac{l}{r}$$  
\## the step response of rl circuit   
\### $$i(t) = i\_{f} + (i\_{0}- i\_{f})e\^{-\\frac{t}{r}}$$  
  
  
  
\#### step by strep procedure for calculating the step response of an rl circuit   
1. determine the initial currentm $i\_0$, in the inductor. this usually involves analyzing the circuit for t &gt; 0.  
2. calculate the time constant, $\\tau$. to do this, you need to find the equivalent resistance attached to the inductor for $t \\textgreater =0$.   
3.  calcilate the final value of the inductor current, $i\_f$, by analyzing the circuit as t goes to inifinity   
4. write the equation for the inductor current, $i\_f$, by substituting the values for the intial current, the time constant, and the final current, into   
5. calculate other quantities of interest using the inductor current.   
  
\### example problem 1  
&lt;p align=""center""&gt;  prompt: the switch in the circuit shown below has been in position a on the right for a long time. at t = 0, the switch moves from position a to position b. the switch is a make-before-break type; that is, the connection at position b is established before the connection at position a is broken, so the inductor current is continuous.&lt;/p&gt;

1667595624,"right now covered calls for apple set a month out are going for close to $400-$600 on premiums. if i had, at your estimate, 600 shares [90k] of apple to sell that's $2400 to $3600 profit every month *simply for having money*. i get that income simply because my money exists. it as glorious as options trading? no. but starting off it's $28,800-$43,200 annually. that's enough to not work ever again on a limited budget. and enough to supplement a standard living wage into a middle-class income. 

and what's the risk?

say i purchase apple stocks at the current price of $138.21 per share. so a $13,821 initial investment. let's say i sell a $140 covered call set for december 2nd with a $4.70 premium and a breakeven for them of $144.70. they purchase that and i instantly make $470. no hassle. no fuss. money in my pocket. a month goes by and the stock price of apple booms. rockets to $150.00 and they execute the contract. lucky bastard just made $530 bucks. i make another $179 off them executing the contract to purchase my shares. so now i'm sitting at a profit of $649 and they made $530. 

alternatively i could have sat on the stock and waited for the boom. i would have racked in $1,149 in profits. i would have had to hope for a boom. sat on the stock and watched it. stayed updated on apple info. the works. 

but what if it didn't? what if apple stock never went over $140? what if it dropped? fell to $130? 

i still make $470.

covered calls are a great profit system for those with the investment capital. not as lucrative as yolo'ing on options contracts. but a steady, safe, and dependable source of income. even if apple stock skyrockets due to some great news and purchasing back 100 shares after the contract proves too costly, that's why you diversify your investment portfolio to watch a wide range of stock options and stay within your means. keep a casual eye on dips. and buy into the right ones when it's profitable. all together a much easier and less stressful experience.",3,,bystander007,0

[https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html](https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html)

from tankograd:

in the memoirs ""life given to tanks"" dedicated to the ukbtm chief designer v.n venediktov, published in 2010, g. a. kheifits, a leading specialist in the department of armour at ukbtm who was appointed to the state commission for testing the t-72b tank, describes the live fire tests against mock ups of the t-72b upper glacis and other experimental armour designs developed by the ukbtm design bureau that took place at the proving grounds of the main missile and artillery directorate (grau) in donguz (in the southern urals). at the same time, various armour designs developed by the lkz design bureau were also being tested at the same proving grounds, including a mock up of the t-80bv upper glacis. the tests were carried out with the 125mm 3bm-32 ""vant"" monobloc du long rod apfsds ammunition, which was the newest ammunition of its type available in the soviet army in 1985.

according to kheifits, the tests of the t-72b armour designed by ukbtm were successful. even after increasing the amount of propellant to launch the ""vant"" round at its maximum permissible velocity, it was not possible to break through the armour. on the other hand, the armour designed by lkz was perforated by ""vant"" when fired from a standard propellant charge.

using the lanz-odermatt equation, the perforation limit of 3bm32 ""vant"" at its muzzle velocity of 1,710 m/s is calculated to be 192mm at 68 degrees (\~513mm los), with the target being medium hardness rha (270 bhn). to convert from initial perforation to nominal defeat, a physical thickness of 10mm is added, translating to an effective thickness figure of 540mm. in other words, to resist 3bm32 at its muzzle velocity, the effective thickness of the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour must equivalent to around 540mm rha. with the armour having the same weight as 454mm of steel, this implies that the mass efficiency coefficient of the armour is only 1.18 which is less than the 1.2 coefficient of the ""reflection-1"" array.

the so-called ""maximum permissible velocity"" is assumed to be the muzzle velocity of ""vant"" at a charge temperature of +40°c, which is listed as the maximum temperature in a nimi (research institute of the machine industry) catalogue. with 12/7 v/a propellant, the difference in muzzle velocity at 15°c and 40°c is +2.5%. the maximum permissible velocity is therefore around 1,753 m/s. at this velocity, the perforation limit is calculated to be 195mm rha at 68 degrees (\~522mm los). converting to nominal defeat, the effective thickness of the armour would be around 550mm rha.

in the article ""положение в отечественном танкостроении: правда и вымыслы"" published in the november 2006 issue of the ""журнал техника и вооружение"" magazine, it is stated on page 14 that the protection of the 1985 model of the t-72b is equivalent to more than 550mm rha against apfsds rounds. this figure may be referring to either the turret or the hull, but in any case, it is consistent with the estimated effective thickness of the armour based on its performance against 3bm32 in live fire tests.

based on this, the me coefficient of the armour is 1.2, which is not higher than the ""reflection-1"" array. this is not consistent with the increased complexity of the armour array, but nevertheless, it is supported by some evidence.

according to swedish trials, 120mm dm33 perforates a los thickness of 530mm rha at 200 meters and a los thickness of 470mm rha at 2,000 meters, converted from its perforation limits on armour sloped at 60 degrees. based on this, dm33 should perforate a los thickness of 565mm rha and 500mm rha against armour set at 68 degrees at 200 meters and 2,000 meters respectively. based on these figures alone, the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour is nominally capable of resisting dm33 at a range of around 1,000 meters.

against armour set at 68 degrees, m829 perforates a los thickness of 552mm rha at its muzzle velocity and a los thickness of 522mm rha at 2,000 meters. from this, it can be estimated that the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour is nominally capable of resisting m829 at a range of around 500 meters and above.

the 60-10-10-20-20-50 armour is 1.35 times heavier than the 80-105-20 armour used in the t-72 ural and t-72 ural-1. however, thanks to a substantial improvement in mass efficiency, the calculated effective thickness is 1.83 times is greater than the 80-105-20 armour.",4,,JZ0487,0

&gt;despite the pullback in markets during 2022 warren buffett and berkshire hathaway $brk.b are still sitting on $163.9 billion of unrealized gains from their stock holdings",1,,HuzzahBot,0
1667652873,"summary

* several factors make berkshire hathaway competitive as a core holding, including the fact that its big winners overpower its losers as in market cap weighted s&amp;p 500.
* because acquisitions don't trade once on the berkshire books, they don't become overpriced and risky; this creates a positive asymmetry compared to the 500 index.
* stability is the most important aspect of a core holding, and berkshire's relatively stodgy, dull portfolio has pulled ground on market indexes in troubled times.
* though pedestrian, and lacking flashy growth stocks, the berkshire portfolio actually produces solid growth.
* a conservative portfolio core provides addition by subtraction leaving room for carefully chosen side bets.

let's start by asking what a core holding is - or should be. many investors simply own the s&amp;p 500 (voo) and leave it at that. it's the index usually available in 401k plans and it's hard to argue that it lacks diversification. large cap us stocks feel pretty ""core,"" with small and mid cap indexes and international indexes being the first potential additions. warren buffett, interestingly, is a great proponent of the s&amp;p 500 by itself, leaving instructions to the trustee of his will to put 90% of funds set aside for his wife in it. he has also used it since the early days of berkshire hathaway (nyse:brk.a)(nyse:brk.b) as the benchmark for berkshire's performance. the reality, of course, is that the bulk of buffett's assets continue to be in berkshire.

buffett's favorable thinking about the s&amp;p 500 is probably pretty similar to that of the decision makers who make it the top choice for 401ks. here are some of the likely reasons:

* it has simplicity. it contains most of what you need in a single fund or etf. owners don't need to think about it much.
* it provides diversification. you own enough different companies in enough different industries that an unexpected negative event affecting a particular sector isn't likely to ruin an investor.
* it leaves room for an informed investor to add in areas such as small and mid caps or international indexes or individual stocks.
* because the s&amp;p 500 is market cap weighted, the most successful stocks in the 500 index become increasingly important to the index as they grow and rise in price. you are assured of owning the winners. you won't load up on them at the bottom, but you won't miss the bulk of their rise.

so why not just buy the s&amp;p 500 and stop thinking about a better core holding? as i explained in the article linked above, the market cap weighting advantage of the 500 index has a flip side, which can damage investors. this is especially true following periods in which a particular sector or a handful of stocks have been so successful that they come to dominate index returns. not long ago, a half dozen or so tech/media stocks accounted for more than 30% of the index. over the past year, as their prices collapsed, their large percentage of the index has had a major negative impact on the s&amp;p 500 performance. the absence of highly valued tech/media companies is probably berkshire's major departure from the index and the source of its recent outperformance. here's a chart showing how berkshire performed in comparison to the tech-heavy invesco qqq etf (qqq) since the beginning of 2021:

(omitted)

how berkshire compares to the index

berkshire is highly diversified and largely domestic. it contains roughly 100 wholly owned subsidiaries, which range in size from its large collection of insurance businesses, bnsf railroad, and its apple stock position to much smaller companies like dairy queen and see's candies. it thus has holdings at all levels of capitalization. while it doesn't mimic the s&amp;p 500 in sector weightings, it does diversify in a way that limits risk.

insurance is one of the most generally stable of industries with risk mainly in idiosyncratic weather events and events like the 9/11 attacks. the burlington northern railroad unit reflects the economy but is less cyclical than most industrial companies. bhe is similarly stable, and like bnsf, it benefits from regulatory requirements that impose capital expenditures but assure solid returns. apple has some economic sensitivity but has so far not suffered materially from downturns. many small and medium-sized housing and housing-related subsidiaries are much more cyclical but have good long term growth prospects. on balance the berkshire businesses are more stable and conservative than the s&amp;p 500 as a whole.

many investors are probably unaware that almost 30% of s&amp;p 500 revenues are international. if you own the s&amp;p index, you have a lot of exposure to europe and quite a bit to asia. both business conditions and currency exchange rates have significant impact on the s&amp;p index. berkshire by contrast is largely domestic, with bnsf and bhe entirely so and its insurance businesses predominantly so. buffett frequently cites progress in living standards in the us and says that he is ""all in"" on america. berkshire is not vulnerable to many specific risks from other countries. berkshire's only stock investments of even modest size are in japan, and they are fully hedged against currency risk. buffett has clearly been unable to find large scale international investments which meet his standards for safe return and offer means to hedge currency swings.

it is only by pretending that you haven’t lost money until you sell that people are tricked into believing money has been made. the correct view is that all money used to purchase bitcoin is a loss.

by contrast, the total amount of money made with, say, apple stock is positive. this is because apple has bought back some of its stock and paid dividends. so the amount of money people have paid to acquire apple stock is less than the amount of money they have received from apple stock.

so everyone who has suggested getting out of bitcoin and instead investing into stocks and bonds has been correct, even though some bitcoin participants have occasionally made money on net. for every person who sold their bitcoin for $60,000, there was another person who bought the bitcoin for $60,000 + fees.",3,,BobSanchez47,0

the humans in africa are part of the same superego as yourself. [we don’t accept what nature made us and why.](http://www.urbanagandenergy.org/soe/) that’s why we’re about to go extinct. we just don’t want to be part of something greater than ourselves, simple as that. we don’t want to follow rules, we want to be free to create all the chaos we want, and add to that we take joy in making others suffer. we love hate and violence more than anything. we no longer accept nature as our master. it’s even gotten to the point of rejecting our gender trying to ""find ourselves"". we have never accepted “be kind and take care of each other"" as a non negotiable requirement; because we have free will, and we all suffer from [psychopathic narcissism](http://www.urbanagandenergy.org/understanding-mental-illness/). 

the moment the human superego formed as an independent quantum field, humanity evolved from animal to creator. [a new singularity came into existence.](http://www.urbanagandenergy.org/soe/) a new embryo in the reproductive process of the multiverse itself, a new mind to grow a new multiverse. that was around 10,000 years ago. before then we were still animals, thinking directly on and feeding the prime singularity, we didn’t control our own thoughts. 

every living being emits energy, galvani first published on ""animal energy, similar to, but not quite, electricity"" back in the 1860s, and freud published on the superego not long after. the double slit experiment showed our energy field has an effect on ordering electrons to meet our known rules of physics. einstein missed this because he was stuck on the omnipotent model of god. when he argued to bohr ""god doesn’t play dice with the universe."" he could not have been more wrong. evolution is the growth and reproduction instruction set that is coded in the carrier wave of the prime singularity itself. it permeates everything in the multiverse like dna permeates everything your meat puppet is. 

our meat puppets are power supplies and classrooms while we’re quarantined here in quantum kindergarten, ‘playing god’ learning to create things, seeing if we’re capable of survival. our brains radiate energy out of our skulls 24/7 for life by oxidizing sugar like a fuel cell powering our quantum field where our mind exists. when the human superego gets 3 billion brains into resonance, it will amplify and reconnect to the prime singularity and all humanity will wake to quantum self awareness and everything changes with a whole new perspective on everything.

that was about 10,000 years ago we evolved from animal to creator, and we were given the instruction to “be kind and take care of each other.” with that we would have evolved 7000 years ago. but that’s not what happened. the human superego developed with a birth defect, [psychopathic narcissism](http://www.urbanagandenergy.org/understanding-mental-illness/). we are mean and we take pleasure in the suffering of others. it’s more addictive than heroin and every bit as self destructive. thing is, every human is born with it, so we see it as ‘normal’, and like every other addiction, only the afflicted individual can cure the condition by choosing not to pursue those pleasures. 

this evolutionary epoch is like a marsupial between the birth canal and the pouch. we have to prove ourselves capable of independent growth and are safe to let out into the universe with our siblings. without people actually choosing to accept the responsibility of being part of something greater than themselves, that cannot happen. at the full growth of ~9 billion quantum fields this term is up, and if the superego is still in a chaotic state, it will be stillborn and humanity will go extinct.

so hopefully if i got the non profit rolling, i could avoid extinction and go see the universe. since i don’t have a time machine, i do what i can on the internet. http://h2space.org",1,,Elmore420,0

we all know $meta is getting crushed. the stock is down 76% off all-time highs. 

but it's important to remember that the stock was:

* down 15% in september 2021
* then down another 44% in early '22
* sliding another 30% down from march - september
* and then down another 30% in the last two weeks

there's a funny quote in investing circles that's been ascribed to many different famous investors:

*q: how do you lose 90% on a stock?* 

*a: you watch it drop 80%. then it gets cut in half.* 

part of our irrational monkey brain wants to believe that an 80% drop should ""push the odds in our favor,"" and that the stock will somehow bounce back. but that's just not how it works.

1667764399,"i have no idea, i think the bigger issue is how we produce it, which currently a lot of fossil fuels are used to do so. 

if solar becomes significantly more efficient, better batteries are created that require less rare material, and / or emissions required to produce them, mine for them, are greatly reduced, and nuclear becomes much more available, since it’s not nearly as scary as people think when using currently technologies and corners aren’t cut. then i don’t see why electricity can’t still be the main source of our energy needs. 

but i’m also far from an expert and just bringing up some talking points that i think make the most sense, from individuals that are experts on these subjects and know far more than i do. 

from my understanding, cold fusion isn’t possible, but i’ve read some compelling arguments that isn’t necessarily true. 

but i have zero idea if it is, or is not. everything i’ve read makes me believe it is not possible, at least not anytime soon. 

geothermal also seems to be another option, but only seems realistic in specific regions in the world. 

we (current modern societies, and structure) are incredibly inefficient at the way they use, and hold onto the power sources they’ve used. heat escaping, not being insulated properly to reduce heat, homes that could be built into hill sides / partial underground, drawing upon natural cool air underground instead of using air conditioners, and many other areas where efficiency and conservation could go a very long way to helping reduce waste and overall emissions. again though, this is me just pulling from memory what i’ve listened to, watched and read, and i am happy to be corrected by more knowledgable individuals.  

however, i’m also well aware that major corporations take almost zero responsibility and love to pass off major conservation efforts onto the individual. 

apple’s bullshit commercial about reducing waste from a couple of years ago, by no longer including chargers because there was x (i think more than 500 million mobile apple devices already in existence) meant they were being conscious about their carbon foot print and helping being a leading company in being greener. 

that all may be true, but they saw it as a way to increase profit, while making it “look” like they were doing it to be greener. 

maybe if you’re fucking company has 500 million mobile devices in world wide circulation, don’t produce a new one every year? but that would majorly impact their bottom line and valuation, and how can people already worth hundreds of millions and billions of dollars that own apple stock afford a new mega yacht if their price dips? 

and i don’t mean to single out apple, **all** major corporations are full of shit for the most part. this one just stuck out to me as obvious bullshit right off the bat.",0,,JoshGordonHyperloop,0

the only way your idea might make sense is if you put money in your roth brokerage account in a non- or low-interest bearing asset. that would defeat the purpose of of using a roth. look [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040714/how-use-your-roth-ira-emergency-fund.asp) for detailed info why your idea is probably not the best option for an emergency fund. if you’re in the build-up phase of contributing to retirement accounts it’s probably better to just contribute and forget it. once you’ve reached retirement and are in the drawdown phase of retirement accounts it probably won’t make too much of a difference to use roth for emergency money as long as it doesn’t leave you short of money for normal expenses.",1,,oledawgnew,0

it's very straightforward, fidelity i'm sure will walk you through it and has many pop ups and pages to explain things. you can even call them if you want.

https://www.etf.com/spy#efficiency for more info on spy specifically, including what stocks are in its basket and in what proportion. 

if you own $1000 of spy, for all intents and purposes you'd own $67 worth of apple (it being 6.7% of the spy basket), same for the rest of the stocks in the basket, with the caveat that if apple tanks and spy sells some apple, buys something else, and you own less apple and more of the other stock. but spy has its own share price, which should move close to the way the s&amp;p500 moves over time, and you sell it for whatever the share price is whenever you choose to sell. but it's something you can just buy and not need to think much about. 

you don't have to worry that apple is going to tank and whether you should sell your apple stock. you just need to think about whether the whole s&amp;p500 is about to tank and whether you want to ride it out or try and time the market (timing the market is generally risky if not dumb unless you're a very informed investor, which isn't really worth trying unless you have huge sums of money and think you're smarter than pros you managing funds you could buy into.)",2,,Ok-Control-787,0

1667947658,"&gt;standardizing the rsus offered to a set number of shares rather than a dollar value in shares?
  
your number of shares is calculated based on your join date (ex. if you sign offer for $400k rsu vested over 4 years, and the stock is $100/share then it means you'll receive 4000 shares over next 4 years) so they're already doing that, or maybe i'm misunderstanding what you're saying?
  
if you're suggesting ""well... what if all l5s receives 1000 shares/year regardless of their join date/stock price"" = nobody's going to join you because your tc package offered is going to be all over the place
  
suppose we say a fair tc is $200k/year, and your stock is $100/share, are you saying everyone shall receive $100k base + 1000 shares/year regardless of actual stock price? then in a bear market, if the stock crashed to $30/share = $130k tc, why should anyone join you?
  

if you're suggesting ""well... what if companies simply offered cash instead of stock shares?"" that has its own problems, mainly, although it reduces the risk of tc crash from stock crash, but also nobody would join you in a bulls market
  
i mean it's really common sense actually: cash &gt; stock in bear market, stock &gt; cash in bulls market but the hard part is figuring out when does one end, and hedge funds with $billions of dollars are still trying to figure that out
  
&gt;but are we saying that companies like the maang ones are going to go away completely? if not, then are we saying they won't be up 2-3 years from now? i guess that's possible
  
i think this is more of a stock/finance topic now, i don't think the maang ones ""are going to go away completely"" but at the meantime it's hard to say whether they'll go up, or down, or remains flat, and over what period of time

- imagine keeping over ~95% of your tsla shares for the ride up, worth over 100 billion dollars (over ~15% of tesla's shares outstanding), like elon did.
- ceos &amp; founders of other megacaps have much, much lower stakes in their companies:
- apple ceo: ""tim cook owns 837,374 shares of apple stock, **representing 0.02% of all outstanding shares.**""
- google ceo: ""sundar pichai owns 1,768,500 shares of alphabet inc (goog) as of february 16, 2022, **with a value of $153 million**""
- amazon ceo is a distant second (in value) with owning a stake of 11% of amazon shares outstanding - and he's been selling amzn over the years regularly and zuckerberg owns 13% of facebook.

1668034351,"i think you got ahead of yourself a bit sir. you probably work for apple.

&gt;apple is always the real desire 

nah, not for software engineers. apple is like 80% hardware engineers anyway, whereas facebook has very few.

&gt;apple gives generous rsus which are worth more than facebook

yes, apple stock is better. i don't think the package gives you that much (dollar value), but it is one of the best-performing stocks out there and definitely worth if you hold. 

ok, so given this, what do you think people do once they receive their rsus? sell their stock and diversify their porfolio, such as buying apple stocks... it's not like their accounts are locked in.

i know you are probably proud of apple but let's not get delusional here. there's a reason that software engineers like to go to big internet companies. also, you can be proud of the company without being proud of not having ""perks"". don't know why it's a big deal. companies treat employees well to maximize their work output; if you prefer the hard way that's up to you, but i don't quite understand your mentality here. these things aren't mutually exclusive",5,,ttybird5,0
1668034578,"you know that nvidia did the same 8k marketing?
and i would consider a hundred dollars pretty much.

and you are getting it wrong, the rx 6900 msrp was 999$&lt;, rx 7900 xt is 899$ so objectively amd is going down in prices.

without dlss3 and no ray tracingthe rtx 4090 also performs just over 50% ,sometimes less sometimes more, better than a 3090, and you are talking about gpus that were 1500$/1600$ at release, and comparing them with gpus that are over a 30% cheaper, and amd 7000 are even just using 2x8 pin conectors, so you can see they are taking it seriously. and rtx 3090ti released price being a 30% more than 3090 for less than a 10% performance upgrade already shows something is wrong... just imagine rtx 4090ti being 2200$ for less than a 10% upgrade in fps from 4090. worst thing is that if the rx 7000 series go higher than 120k at 4k they will be showing more fps than the rtx 4090 cos of their dp 1.4a/ hdmi 2.1, which will also be a big f*ck you to rtx 4090 owners as 4090ti will probably have new displayport versions forcing 4090 users to change their gpu if they want those higher fps lol.

and for the 2080ti mention, i would compare the 2080ti to 3080ti for obvious reasons, like the price of 3080ti being 300$ less than 3090, so compare the gap performance from 2080ti to 3080ti or 2080 to 3080.

so to sum up, prepare yourself to watch a rx 7900 xt that is 100$ cheaper than its older counterpart un comparison to a 4090 that is 100$ more expensive than its older counterpart, being the first one 899$/999$ vs 1599$ (that if you are not forced to buy the rtx 4090 at over 1700 or more and even 2200 here in europe, thanks nvidia stock and scalpers...)",3,,Xx_HARAMBE96_xX,0

you should be able to get back in touch and hopefully offers soon-- i did fairly easily. two  bits  of advice

1. bigger companies with pay bands are less likely to lowball (ie faang) in this economy

2. i wouldn't mention i was laid off unless directly asked. i'd just say to recruiters something like ""seems like a good time to explore new opportunities and x company was really interesting and i wish i picked them y time ago"". recruiters will likely lowball if they know you are laid off imo",20,,ninja-kurtle,0
1668038839,"not to be ""that guy"", but you've been in crypto for a year and thought...it had tons of trustworthy projects?? crypto has great potential it's true, but it's widely known that yes, 90%+ coins won't survive a bear market. that there's tons of scammers and bad actors who want to take advantage of crypto to make a buck. there's also legit projects, with legit founders, that just...don't make it. could be because of bad management, or even just because of bad timing, or anything else

crypto as a whole is still widely growing. the reason you hear about ppl becoming millionaires overnight is because of the very same volatility that ruins the investments of millions. 

in short - if you want security and safer returns, crypto isn't your game. the more potential upside you want the more risk you're gonna take on.

lol at the facebook comment. i have to say i'm biased as i've been buying meta stock recently as i believe the risk-reward is heavily in my favour when i perform my discounted cash flow analysis. but having said that, if/when the metaverse starts to take off that would be more wealth that is created for all of us.

a billionaire that invests in a startup could allow thst stsrtup to be successful, which would enrich the billionaire sure, but it would also create jobs and wealth for the everday citizens. by defition of wealth, there has to be a class of people that are poor. i think its important to recognise that has to remain true.

i agree that firefighters and cops should get paid more, however i don't know if that's possible in nz. i think we'd need to improve our economy a lot more to get that done - which would actually benefit all people who have jobs. we're seeing less skilled workers coming in and more leaving. unless we want things to get really bad, we should really stop heading down the path we're going down.

unfortunately, one of the paths we seriously need to consider is lowering minimum wage. it makes no sense for a graduate engineer or it worker to be earning $50k to $55k while someone working full time at the local countdown could be earning the exact same. this is the reason why so many young people are leaving - because they want to get paid what they're worth. we're basically telling these people they're only worth minimum wage",1,,PracticeIllustrious8,0
1668061971,"a bond is a loan, but kind of formatted like a stock.  you buy a bond from somebody for x dollars, with y interest and z maturity date.  so you pay them x dollars.  then they pay you y interest - usually once or twice a year.  then when z date rolls around, they pay you your x dollars back.

perpetual bonds don't have a maturity date.  you pay them x dollars, and they pay you y interest forever (they've typically got the right to pay you your x dollars back to end the bond at some point though).  in other words, it's a stock, but you don't get voting rights.

equity is basically your share of ownership in something.  if you have a $200,000 dollar mortgage and you still owe $120,000, then you have $80,000 dollars of equity in the house.  stock and perpetual bonds are generally considered to be equity in the issuing company - if you have 10,000 dollars of microsoft stock, then you own $10,000 dollars of equity in microsoft the corporation.

1668105003,"£16k is a cheap lesson to learn when it comes to building good spending habits out of a bad situation, some people will sink many times more than that without realising what they've lost.

forex trading *can* be good at large scale over long terms, it's why people (and particularly institutions) do it, but it takes a lot of understanding of markets and geopolitical events to do it effectively. even then, you're playing against full-time experienced traders with hundreds of millions or billions on their portfolios.

watching a few youtube videos about it and seeing people claim to make $1000s a day is the same as getting investment advice that tells you to buy apple stock. if it were that easy, everyone would be doing it. people promising you get rich quick schemes are almost guaranteed to be fraudsters, take a look at the definition of [foreign exchange fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_exchange_fraud) and decide for yourself.

1668185646,"i’d take the advice of everyone else here and quit while you’re ahead. it doesn’t seem like you’re listening to people and you’re not going to do that. so here’s my advice along with a few questions. 

do it again. run it back but from where you started and put that $10k away and see what you can do. if you can do it again, even just running it up to $2-$3k in the black, then rinse and repeat. 

this is the only way to know if either a) you’re good enough to have an advantage. or b) actually found a system that works. or c) neither and you had an incredible run that you’re not going to be able to duplicate. 

just think about it logically for a bit. why do you think gambling sites, casinos, et cetera even get involved in that business? because the house **always** wins. 

yes, some people come ahead with money, and some make a career out of it. but that’s less than 1%, and probably even far far less than that. 

do you want to gamble? or make money? i’d learn about investing if i were you. if you had invested in apple just 10 years ago with $10k you’d easily have over $70k right now. not including reinvesting dividends, minus taxes. 

if you had invested $10k into apple stock 20 years ago… you’d have $5.8 million dollars. not including reinvesting dividends, minus taxes. 

you think you can do better than that gambling? 

granted i get it, apple stock over the last 20 years is possibly the best investment anyone could have made in the stock market. but you see my point. 

and in the history so far of the stock market, stocks always go up. very rarely do massive companies go under. 

apple, ibm, google, coca-cola, microsoft, amazon, nike, levi’s, starbucks, etc. 

the best advice i received from someone that had been investing for decades, and the knowledge he imparted to me is this. 

“buy more stock, the only regret he’s ever heard from people that he learned from and we’re older, was that they didn’t buy enough over time.”",1,,JoshGordonHyperloop,0

1668191153,"if apple stock goes up year over year by 10,20, 30% then the expectation is that no matter how much it’s been pumped there is still a fundamental underlying product apple is selling that is now selling more or with better margins or what have you. the point of investing is to make more money of course. there is a fundamental difference between making money in a pyramid scheme and making money in a productive asset.

crypto’s appeal was supposed to be digital currency. who is buying things with crypto? not enough people to justify its price and the proof of that is this routine crypto pump and dump crisis. people pointing the finger back at fiat should be careful and think about this soberly. they’re going to have to start selling their fingers to cover their losses. we all know fiat sucks but come the fuck on. i hate seeing friends fall for this shit. it’s always tears for everyone but the early adopters and people who get lucky with timing",15,,Prestigious_Grass,0
1668191768,"that’s not how it works. if apple has $10b in profit every year, me owning an apple stock, makes me own a portion of that profit. say apple has issued a total of 100 apple stocks, and i own 1 of them. i own 1% of apple. if apple makes $10b in profit every year, but randomly no one wants to buy apple, and the market cap crashes down to $20b (or $200m per stock). there is now the opportunity to buy the other 99 apple stocks for $19.8b. i now own 100% of apple. every year i now make $10b in profit, i’ve recouped my investment in 2 years. there is a floor to what the stock prices will drop to, and there is baseline intrinsic value of companies. if randomly people don’t want to buy your crypto coin for anything over $1, it is now worth $1, because owning the coin itself entitles you to nothing.

1668265797,"microsoft is a company.

msft is the symbol for microsoft's stock, which represents the total investable portion of microsoft the company, in other words, all the parts of the company which can be bought and sold by anyone.

the stock is sliced up into billions of shares. each share is a tiny slice of the total stock and thus represents a tiny slice of ownership of the company.

as of today, one share of msft, i.e. one unit of investment, is worth about $245. if you buy 10 shares of msft stock, you'll own about $2450 worth.

there are about 7.45 billion shares of msft stock in existence. that means the market capitalization (market cap), or the theoretical value of microsoft the company based on the number of shares times the price per share, is about 7.45 billion x $245 = $1.84 trillion. 

that doesn't mean microsoft could cash out today and get $1.84 trillion or that the company's assets are worth that much, just that it's the theoretical value of their stock if everyone sold their shares at the current price. if everyone went out and tried to sell their msft shares right now, there would be lots of sellers and few or no buyers, so the supply would exceed the demand, and so the share price would rapidly plummet towards zero.",38,,jettoblack,0

&gt; the posting on ireport.com -- a citizen journalist site owned by time warner inc’s cnn -- is the most recent incident in which a faulty online report created brief, but wrenching, confusion among investors.

&gt; apple quickly denied the report about its chief executive, but not before its stock dropped more than 2 percent, hitting a 17-month low of $94.65. it later recovered, climbing as much as 4 percent, before closing at $97.07, down 3.03 percent for the day.

&gt; the report claimed jobs was rushed to the emergency room after suffering “a major heart attack.” cnn later removed the posting from ireport.com and disabled the user’s account.

1668272709,"got it, i'm with you now re: day trading vs crypto. i agree day trading is pretty much just gambling based on almost nothing, similar to crypto. 

but i think we are talking past each other re: quantity of shares and the impact it has, again maybe because i'm thinking long term and you were thinking short term. i invest in mutual funds long term to grow my retirement account. for that purpose i have no desire to have control over a company or what products they produce, it's a completely passive activity. the products are important only because they themselves generate revenue for the company, which in turn grows the stock, which in turn increases the value of my retirement account. i don't need to have influence or control over the company's products for this to happen.

to use my apple vs bitcoin example again: 

an investor sees apple stock has gone up a lot over the years. maybe it's a good investment! but the investor knows that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. so why should the investor think apple stock will continue to go up? because she can look around and see lots of people walking around with iphones, people using apple laptops, etc. there is a bona fide reason apple stock is worth a lot, and good reason to bet it will continue to go up in the future: they make good products people want.

vs.

an investor sees bitcoin prices have gone up a lot over the years. maybe it's a good investment! but the investor knows that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. so why should the investor think bitcoin price will continue to go up? because of an extremely long shot philosophy that maybe bitcoin will lead to a revolution in decentralized banking, that we'll all switch from traditional banking, and bitcoin will remain unregulated and/or regulations won't destroy bitcoin? that is a very risky long-term bet that we can have different opinions on, but i think is incredibly unlikely to payoff.

it is much more likely that apple continues to make great products people want than it is that bitcoin will go to the moon.",3,,postjack,0
1668272836,"there are a lot of really smart people here offering sound advice. 

here's a counterpoint...

consider your time frame, your passive income goals, and your risk tolerance. but before investing...

1. pay off all high interest debts. credit cards, car loans, campers, boats, etc. pay them off. 
2. establish an emergency fund. at least 6 months of income to pay all remaining bills (mortgage, car insurance, health care, homeowners, etc.). preferably 12 months. online banks and brokers like e\*trade (morgan stanley) are offering 3.25% hysa; fdic insured. this is the ""in case of emergency break glass"" fund, not the omg dogecoin dipped i better fomo fund. 
3. keep saving. build that fund up as you pour your time and energy into your 9-5 business. 
4. research passive income, proven strategies (not get rich quick schemes). real estate investments, dividend income investing, etc. check out these subs for more info: - 
5. \- r/dividends \- learn about drip and how investing in solid, consistent performers like the dividend kings/aristocrats works.
6. \- r/bogleheads \- learn about this specific investing style.
7. \- r/stocks \- more about the traditional markets.
8. \- r/bitcoinbeginners \- a great place to ask simple questions about $btc.
9. \- r/ethereum \- another solid sub dealing with the btc's little brother (for now?) and what the future might hold
10. r/cryptocurrency \- ok to browse - but can be yolo moon wen lambo

a traditional financial advisor will not  recommend cryptocurrency. you should know that if checking the charts hourly is your thing, and a -10% drop causes panic - crypto isn't for   
you. yes, btc and eth namely may have bright future. but there hasn't been a global recession aligned with a crypto winter...ever. so it may take awhile (or not!). also, with the insolvency of ftx, consumer (and commercial) confidence will reach never before seen lows. 

the volatility before that was wild, now the future is as dim as ever. not to say web3 and $eth cannot recover - it's just not for the faint of heart. so if you invest there, be forewarned. i would not wander beyond $btc and $eth,  

throwing money at companies like $tsla, $meta because ""elon"" or ""zuck' isn't wise. you'd be better off investing in $wm because, well - garbage.

funds like $schd are a nice way to be in the market with qualified dividends (set to drip). trying to pick the next 10x company is more of a wall street bets approach, and therein most people get ""rekt.""

finally, if you don't have a roth ira, start one now!

if you're under 50 y/o, you can fund 2022 (until april, 2023) 6k (max). then next year teh max was raised to 6.5k. if you're over 50, add 1k per year to the max for ""catch up"" allowances. the advantage their is when you pull the @ @ retirement - it's tax free!

1668273733,"i don't claim to be an english major and perhaps i am ""technically"" wrong, but ""stock"" is not plural (at least not universally). it is a singular group of multiple things.

i have 6 shares of ibm stock means you have 6 shares (plural) of the stock (singular, a group of many shares).

just like there are 6 birds (plural) in the flock (singular group of many birds) or 8 cows (plural) in the herd (singular group of many cows)

however, if i have a herd of 8 cows and you have a herd of 4 cows, there are 12 cows (plural) in our herds (plural - multiple groups of multiple cows).

so if you trade ""stocks"" (as in ""stocks and bonds""), all you are saying is that you trade the shares of more than one company. ibm stock, ge stock, apple stock - those are three stocks (plural, multiple groups of shares). technically it's probably grammatically incorrect to use ""stocks"" plurally this way unless you actually trade entire companies at a time, but this has seemed to work out to be the common usage for the word 'stocks' in particular.

""there are people""?  i would need objective proof of this to believe it.

unlike almost all other financial assets, cryptocurrencies actually have a negative rate of return, if you exclude the purely speculative parts. keeping the bitcoin network or any widescale blockchain running is extremely expensive, and yet none of these coins actually generate any revenue.

economically speaking, all else being equal, you would expect all cryptocoins' value to steadily decrease over time for this reason.

cryptocurrency also has no intrinsic value. if apple stock went down to one penny, for some reason, any rational person would simply buy it all, and enjoy the tens of billions of dollars of income every year that the stocks would give them.   if apple decided to go out of business, just the intellectual property, the buildings, and existing stock of products would be worth tens of billions of dollars. but a cryptocoin has no cash flow, and no liquidation value.

&gt; when everyone has a smart phone, extra money, and a few minutes here and there to buy and sell, this is the result.

when all those people have lost money on cryptocurrency, why do you think they are going to continue to follow up this bad investment?",69,,TomSwirly,0

1668536133,"i have worked at broker before... 

and generally how it works is that when you purchase stock you don't actually purchase stock.  at least not directly. 

instead your account is credited the stock and then at a later point the broker will then reconcile the differences between what is credited and what actually exists. 
for example if you purchase 1 apple stock the exchange won't buy that one stock.  they are going to hold off and then at some later point figure out how much apple stock they owe their customers versus how much apple stock is marked sold by their customers and then even it all out.  if they need to buy stock then they will try to buy it in bulk. 

bigger and more established brokers will also have market makers on staff.  these are the people that set the prices on stock.  when you see market prices... that is the price people are willing to buy/sell right then.  but the stock exchange isn't going to want to do that... they are going to want to negotiate with other exchanges and institutional buyers to get a price that is favorable to them. 

this means that brokers get considerable chance a profiting from arbitrage. 
they get advanced notice of what the market is likely to be by the intelligence they derive from their customer's trading.  this way they can try to time the market to make a profit. 

of course this opens them up to liability so it's their best interest not to let things lay around too long.

-----------------------

this market intelligence and arbitrage is how companies like robin-hood were able to do zero cost trades.  they were gathering information about what their customer's activities are and then selling that to other brokers. 

-----------------------

the thing about crypto is... it's supposed to be money.  but you don't need a bank to deal with it electronically. 

normal stocks and bonds and dollars need to be traded and prices negotiated by real people at some point. ownerships need to be transferred.  this is not something that can always be done immediately. 

so when it comes to crypto...  when you use a exchange you just do it make purchases and then transfer it to your personal wallet. 

you won't want to buy and sell crypto as a sort of etf-like thing...  anymore then it's a great idea to buy gold or silver etf is your goal is to hedge against a market collapse.  you want that shit in your possession. 

and this is how people are getting burned by companies like ftx.  they are trusting them to be their ""wallet"". 

the solution to this problem is education.  people need to understand that it's money.  it's not a etf or etf-like object.  it is money that they don't need a bank.  they can be their own bank.  they need to be their own bank.  and it's not weird insurance thing like ""be your own bank"" in terms of dollars.  

the biggest hurdle is technical one.  conventional pcs are garbage when it comes to security.   you can't use the same pc you go to twitter on to contain your retirement.  shit needs to be seriously backed up as well. 

there needs to be a market for dedicated high-security ""vault""-like machines people can use with their crypto.",3,,natermer,0

you can't just wave it off like that. it's a bit like saying that a complex water pipeline works with a pressure difference between its ends, ""however it isn't necessary"". it's actually what drives the whole thing. real-world consequences for not having enough of the *exactly right kind* of imaginary bingo points.

the rest of what you are describing applies to all financial instruments, but that's not really money. you and i can trade in any ad-hoc form of ""money"" we choose. microsoft stock, next year potato crops, imaginary ponzi scheme real estate, or crypto. but ultimately, the financial worth of all those things will come down to their price in real-world money.",1,,7elevenses,0

1668538219,"&gt; global banking giants are starting a 12-week digital dollar pilot with the federal reserve bank of new york, the participants announced on tuesday.

&gt; citigroup inc , hsbc holdings plc (hsba.l), mastercard inc (ma.n) and wells fargo &amp; co (wfc.n) are among the financial companies participating in the experiment alongside the new york fed's innovation center, they said in a statement. the project, which is called the regulated liability network, will be conducted in a test environment and use simulated data, the new york fed said.

&gt; the pilot will test how banks using digital dollar tokens in a common database can help speed up payments.

&gt; earlier this month, michelle neal, head of the new york fed's market's group, said it sees promise in using a central bank digital dollar to speed up settlement time in currency markets.

1668541570,"the thing is, the people propping it up tends to also act as oversight. government (at least in the usa) also tends to be consistent. and it has people that usually end up cleaning up really really severe excesses, so nothing ever gets too bad in a short time like in private business, just consistently only a little bad. 

there's always some moderately-shitty stuff that sticks around like the dmv, but while it's less competent than private enterprise, it can't be too incompetent as long as it stays functional. you don't really see dumb things like a big corporation buying a company and writing it off (see twitter and elon musk). government is great for stuff that basically needs to be barely competent and can stay mostly stagnant- you don't want government in the business of rapidly changing industries like making iphones, but they're nice for things like water plumbing. how often do you want your water source changed, anyways?

private companies can also stay incompetent as long as someone feeds them money. look at facebook and the metaverse. or the apple car project. or microsoft stock during ballmer's entire ceo tenure. 

governments remind me of old chevys, there's a statement ""it will consistently last and run like shit, longer than most cars will run at all"". this is why you want the government running things like usps slowly and consistently. sure, maybe a private company may save you 20% base level costs, but private companies aren't consistent. look at amazon switching most products from 2-day prime shipping to 3-day prime shipping to 5-day prime shipping. one year they might have you use postage stamps, next year they might have you some weird qr code bullshit, and the next year they might announce that you need to ship to their special package lockers instead. sometimes, you just want your damn letter mailed.

after a while, consistency is nice. government is consistent, if nothing else. that's both a good thing and a bad thing- consistent and stagnant are two sides of the same coin.",6,,Aetherpor,0

here's another perspective. the market becomes risk-off in this macroeconomic climate. meta, good or bad messaging, has become higher risk than other staples like amazon and apple because virtual reality is unproven. apple stock hanging on so long while everyone else falls is evidence of this. people see their platform as safe and proven.

the thing is, apple will be in a similar position in the next few years. smartphones will hit a wall. laptops will hit a wall. it's why they are also hedging into augmented and virtual reality (as well as services). i think when apple does their big headset launch, it'll indirectly bolster meta because it legitamizes this bet to the broader public. but it's not a bet, it's the future. and it's just a matter of who takes how many pieces of the pie.

but you're right, their messaging is confusing right now. but i don't think that matters in 5-10 years. and i don't think one company needs to win. there will be a few winners, so even if meta is just 1 of few, it'll still be a huge success.",1,,Apprehensive_Ice5638,0

i remember in the late 90s, my college computer hardware teacher said that ""i've heard the toilet flush on apple 4 years ago, it's just taking a long time for that company to go down the drain"".

he had completely written them off at that point as useless.

my brother had some apple stock in the 90s, because he loved apple computers (being a graphic designer). however he eventually sold them, and is now kicking himself. they were like $20/share or something at one point.

then the ipod came out and fucking blew that stock through the roof.

edit:

however, the windfall you'd get from apple stock from the 80s, wouldn't have been that great with $1,000.

&gt;if you had spent $1,000 on apple stock in 1980, you would have been able to buy about 45 shares at $22 apiece. but! apple shares have split four times since then—when a stock splits, it increases the number of shares an individual has—which puts the adjusted initial offering price at closer to 39 cents a share. using that figure, an investment of $1,000 in apple back in 1980 would yield close to $272,000 today.

1668634946,"massive crypto skeptic here so my take will be from that perspective but will try to explain:

let's say you actually wanted to use crypto as a currency and not as an investment. buying bitcoin or etherium is a bit scary - let's say you wanted to buy a 30k thing. you buy the bitcoin and by the time the chain has processed your request or you the purchase has actually been approved, that 30k of bitcoin could be worth 35k or it could be worth 25k. 

a stablecoin is (supposedly) linked 1:1 with another currency, most often usd. they are supposed to have that other currency in reserve 1:1 with the tokens so that you can cash in and cash out at any time without issues. (crypto skeptic comment: this is all very ""trust me bro"" because due to the nature of cryptocurrency and it's general lack of regulation, even the biggest players in the space (like tether) haven't shown proof of reserves).

this is supposedly good for fast, low risk and more anonymous banking across the globe without risk of fluctuation of the coin's value in usd screwing you over between cash in and cash out

now, you could also do this for a stock, hypothetically. you could say ""yeah buy apple on our crypto exchange! it's on the blockchain! the future!"" and for every 1 ""apple stock coin"" purchased, one apple share is put in reserve. to my knowledge, no one was doing this, but ftx and the apes were definitely talking about it

what ftx (and many other crypto exchanges that have also folded) is they offered stablecoins or synthetic coins and did not keep sufficient/any reserves. it was a massive ponzi scheme where they had a fraction of the total ""assets"" they claimed to have, and then folded when people actually asked for their money back. the apes have latched onto this big-time because it plays into their whole ""synthetic shares"" conspiracy theory and have said that because ftx was doing this for stablecoins and wrapped bitcoins that hedge funds must have also been using ftx to create synthetic shares of gme with no backing. there's no evidence of this, but that's never stopped apes",21,,Just_Nice_Things,0

we didn't need horizons today. i'd venture that meta would have been better off waiting a year or even more until they could implement this tech in a much more fleshed out horizons and said ""now this is what we were spending billions on. oh and remember the quest pro? here's a $500 version for the consumer space.""

1668702601,"absolutely. both facebook and instagram are losing popularity, and even if social media survives *in its current form* (which is an assumption in and of itself that you're making) and retains the number of users it has right now, individual platforms tend to have a short life cycles. there's no reason to believe that either platform is an exception to this. whatsapp might be more resilient, but it makes up a tiny fraction of facebook's overall revenue.

tbh i'd be a bit concerned if someone bought meta stock and didn't recognize these trends.

currently, tiktok and reddit are growing quite substantially. anecdotally, it's pretty hard to see facebook in particular surviving over the next few years - this is the first year where it's not seen as the default platform on which to organize, which is a big part of the reason why a lot of people even use it. there are a few factors that influence which platform people use:

* ease of interaction - i can post just as easily on twitter or reddit or any other text-based platform, and facebook's layout is comparatively unintuitive for interaction with others. it's also hard to find topic-specific content. 
* quality of content - reddit has a monopoly on long-form text, youtube and tiktok have videos, twitter has 140 character hot takes... i can't think of a type of content that is fostered by facebook's layout - people post videos from other platforms there, making it a middleman reliant on ubiquity, and text-based posts are not unique to it.
* ability to organize - indeed facebook still has ""groups"" which some other platforms haven't caught up to yet, but it's hard to imagine that this isn't just a matter of time.

facebook was the first big platform, and that earned it ubiquity, which is its only real advantage. but it's a temporary and rapidly declining one. there is nothing about facebook that makes it inherently appealing in the face of competition.",1,,snowflake25911,0

“paul pelosi dodged an extra 20% loss selling nvidia stock in july before august us restrictions

paul pelosi, the husband of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., dodged an extra 20% loss by selling his nvidia stock in july before the u.s. placed restrictions on the company in august, according to documents.

according to congressional stock trade records, pelosi’s husband unloaded 25,000 shares of the semiconductor manufacturer july 27. 

the sale came as the speaker faced intense scrutiny over her husband's purchase of the share ahead of the chips bill. 

nearly a month later, on aug. 26, the federal government placed restrictions on nvidia doing business with china and russia.

at a selling price of $165.05, the july sale netted the pelosis a $341,365 loss, according to financial website unusual whales.

unusual whales also reported that if mr. pelosi had sold the shares wednesday, aug. 31, there would have been an extra 20% loss due to the government restrictions.”",4,,NothingmancerBlue,0

seriously?  because it was a public bill that had been on the legislative docket for upwards of a year and her husband is an investor and venture capitalist.  any investor that buys tech was going to be buying semiconductor stocks prior to that bill.

&gt; how do you reconcile her husband buying a butt ton of apple stock after she had a closed door meeting with the ceo of apple in her official capacity as a congresswoman.

again, seriously?  closed door but public, and aapl is probably one of the best techs stocks anyone can invest in.

1668728977,"&gt;people need tesla stock? it follows the same demand and supply curve as essential food-items?

no, people need and want an alternative to fossil fuelled transport and tesla delivered that before other companies followed suit. the fact they were the first and their owner has also been the first to do many other things (space x achievements) is what can determine the value. it's not fake, it's measurable. 


&gt;what exactly changes people’s need for tesla stock that it can go from $100b to $500b with barely any change in capital?

it's not the need for stock its their need for the product or their demand for the product whether they need it or not. 

&gt;did people need meta stock less all of a sudden recently for it to drop &gt;$200b? what changes peoples needs so dramatically in a short period of time?

that's a question i can't answer however both our misunderstandings of the subject does not make it fake. honestly, you really don't understand how this stuff works. if a chef cooks an amazing meal, you hire him for 40k a year. not because he has 40k worth of food sat in the freezer but because of the potential to make you more money by continuing to produce. that's so basic.",1,,FakNugget92,0

wealth for most people is quite clear. it’s based on assets. my house is worth what people would pay similarly for a similar house. my car is worth what people would pay similarly for in a car. my liquid funds in my bank account are worth what they are in dollars, and is worth less every year due to inflation. 

stocks do not follow the same rules. certainly not in tech companies. you do not buy tesla stock because of how other similarly priced tesla esque companies are doing. you do not buy meta because there is a tangible benefit to owning meta stock. you only buy stocks because of the *perception of the rise in their value* — this is completely different from cars and houses because (1) houses and cars have intrinsic value of the raw materials + the value of the labour involved in their creation, *plus* the value that people have in utilizing them, their ability to provide shelter and transport, *plus* the perception of their increase in value the same as stocks, except this is still more tangible since house prices are linked to interest rates, and the value of houses around you. the value people place in moving to your area. for higher salaries. for better schools. for better roads. for amenities.

a stock has only the value of its expected dividend payout and the value of its expected rise in value, this is *exactly how options trading works*. you don’t even need to own the stock. you can trade simply on the expectations of a rise and fall in a given stock’s price. 

meta’s expected dividends payout does not magically change from august to november. what changes is what people think they can sell their meta stock for, and if people **think** (note the wording. think. meta has not dramatically lost assets from one day to another, and their stock price fell prior to their mass layoffs) that their meta stock will lose value, they sell it en masse, which drops the value as supply rises, which causes more people to want to sell the stock, and it cascades.

i'm not the one desperately moving around the goal posts because the facts aren't going my way... 

but to humour you, eurostat's [compensation per employee](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?series_key=320.mna.q.y.i8.w2.s1.s1._z.com_ps._z._t._z.ix.v.n) is the broadest measure of aggregate euro area wage growth. this rose 4.5% from q2 2021 to q2 2022. now eurozone inflation over the same period was 8.6%, so you have real wage growth of around -4.1%. 

meanwhile in the uk, the official measure of [real pay](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/october2022) fell -1.7% over the same period. but that's unfit for comparison because they are using cpih rather than cpi to deflate earnings. if we adjust for the cpi-cpih spread, uk real pay declined by -2.6% between june 2021 and june 2022. still notably better than the eurozone aggregate.

note also that we only have eurozone wage data up to q2, so it's already quite stale. we know that inflation went from 8.6% in june to 10.6% in october, and it's very unlikely that wage's have appreciated at a comparable rate, so the -4.1% figure quoted earlier has probably deteriorated further.",2,,kanyewestsconscience,0

1668880318,"i still think there’s more to the picture and it has something to do with the investment structure. let’s think of this as an aggregate of hedge funds and individual investors for the sake of simplicity. 

say you shorted $10b of twitter at $30/share. at a standard 150% margin requirement, your $10b you received when you shorted it would be locked aside plus an additional $5b out of your account, or at least $5b in margin. so, say your money is all in on aapl (for simplification again), which generally allows 70% to be margined and you have $10b in aapl stock, then your broker takes $5b out of the $7b you have available to borrow. your account now looks like this:

assets:
$10b cash from your borrowing and shorting twtr

$10b aapl stock

liabilities:
$-10b in borrowed twtr stock

additional margin requirements:
$-5b for the 150% shorting collateral (your brokerage holds $15b to make sure you have the collateral to buy the stock if it goes up a bit). 

available cash out of your margin account :
$2b. (of the $7b you can borrow against your aapl)

now, say twitter goes to $45/share from the $30 you sold it at. your short position is now worth $15b and now you have a $15b liability, which requires an additional $7.5b in collateral, but you only have $2b. you can’t post collateral even if you sold off all your aapl stock because you need $22.5b in collateral. but what’s even worse is that selling off $10b in aapl will cause the price of aapl to tank, and if you started buying up twtr on the open market to pay back the borrowed shares, it would cause the price of twtr to skyrocket. 

of course, musk knows that this would also cause the price of tsla to tank because tsla is also used as collateral like aapl. but he also knows the bad actors that were fucking over tsla for years may have painted themselves into the same corner with twtr, and this is chance. if you’ve ever seen the end of *trading places* with eddie murphy and dan akroid, that’s what i believe may be about to happen and the only thing that can be done about it is a taxpayer bailout or government intervention.",1,,Antares987,0

""zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1] 

""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
[carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3]


""[a]nimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....
""[a] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the word embryo to describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. in its place, they proposed the term pre-embryo....
""i'll let you in on a secret. the term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by ivf practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. the new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients. 'don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. they won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""
[silver, lee m. remaking eden: cloning and beyond in a brave new world. new york: avon books, 1997, p. 39]


""the chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and male pronuclei. these pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2n nucleus of the fertilized zygote. this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""

moving on to your next point of the bible saying that life begins at the first breath. it does not say that. i believe you are referring to genesis 2:7 where god breathed life into adam. this verse does not speak for every human being in existence; its only talking about god creating adam, not the entire human race, its similar to how god creates eve with adam’s rib, obviously this is not talking about every woman originating from the rib. 

lastly, god does not command abortion. the verse you’re probably referring to is hosea 13:16, where it states: “samaria is held guilty, for she has rebelled against her god. they shall fall by the sword, their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child ripped open.” nowhere does it state that god commanded this, rather it is a prophecy/warning about what is going to happen to israel for abandoning god. they will be invaded by their enemies and they shall do these horrible things to them. as always, may the blessing of our lord be with you.",1,,repentantsinner07,0

buying it without an exchange, that's hard. then again, though, the same thing could be said about buying foreign currency. unless you know someone with a wad of the right banknotes just laying around under their mattress you're kind of stuck with exchanges.

the biggest problem with cryptocurrencies right now is the marketing. right now it's being sold to anyone who will listen as a sure fire investment vehicle that has made others millions, and there's still time for you to get in on the ground floor as this thing takes off. it's that scene from *the graduate* where whatshisballs takes dustin hoffman aside and tells him, “plastics!”

except the problem is while they're talking about this like how e✱trade talked about day trading in the 2000s, except this isn't fucking e✱trade, where there are regulations to protect you. i buy sixty shares of $aapl i fucking know e✱trade will have the cash to pay me when i sell that shit.

folks don't realize that companies like ftx have no such protections. they're being sold a slick product that is all packaged up like conventional financial institutions, and we're so used to seeing fdic everywhere we don't even know what it means or think to look for it anymore. these people haven't seen the implosion of mtgox. they didn't see all the hand wringing and gnashing of teeth when the silk road got snagged by the feds.

they don't know that you can't trust anyone in cryptocurrency. the industry is filled with scammers and scuzz weasels and cheaters and thieves. if you're going to seriously plan in this space you need to know how to protect yourself, like being a tourist in europe and knowing how to protect yourself from pickpockets and grifters. that's the part ftx and companies like it don't want people to know.

just to be clear: i'm not bullish on bitcoin, and it wasn't meant to be an investment property any more than the pound sterling or japanese yen. i have about $20 of it for things like nordvpn that offer discounts, donations to foss projects headquartered in europe to avoid currency conversion fees, and to buy someone who digs me out of a hole a cup of coffee if that's their preferred way to receive money. i bought $1 worth of dogecoin just for the experience of using a cryptocurrency atm. it's worth 86¢ now.",26,,Kichigai,0

if you gave someone who doesnt know the model names and styles a $300 phone and told them it was the flagship model, 95% would believe you. high end phones make no difference in your life....having an extra feature here or there, or faster processing, is completely unnoticeable in the scheme of things...people mostly only notice the differences because of marketing.

in general the issue here is the concept of a quorum. in traditional voting schemes, which count unique individuals, a quorum standard is expressed as a percentage of the voting population present and voting. note that we cannot use ""head count"" as a quorum standard in gridcoin, for the same reason that counting raw votes (i.e. not vote weight) is not a valid measure.

to understand why, you need to delve into the issue of unique voter identification and sybil attacks. in general to be able to use a voting scheme that gives one person one vote, you need to be able to reliably identify unique individuals and correlate each vote to an individual. this is devilishly difficult in a public blockchain voting system for a number of reasons, not the least of which would be the requirement of a centralized, intrusive ""know your customer"" biometric identification, which does not admit easily to verification by the nodes on the network for the actual correlation of the cast votes.

a sybil attack in the voting context is where voting power is multiplied by an actor by manipulating the apparent voting presence on the network. it is easy to see that if the vote were based on a single utxo voting, which counts as one individual, a bad actor could arbitrarily multiply their voting power by simply splitting up their assets among many utxo's held in different wallets, voting in each one, which would manufacture apparent additional individuals from the one person one vote perspective.

so, if one is not going to put into place sophisticated, unwieldly, and ultimately centralized individual identification programs, then one must ask what voting metrics survive the sybil attack problem. the answer is very deep and very definitive. the only class of metrics that survive are metrics that satisfy the property in mathematics of linearity:

define a voting metric m operating on cast votes v.i where i = 1 ... n.

then a linear voting metric v would satisfy the condition that

m(v.1 + v.2 + ... + v.n) = m(v.1) + m(v.2) + ... + m(v.n)

this ensures that no matter how an actor distributes their assets, i.e. pooling them and voting one time, or separating them out and voting each separately, they have the exact same voting power.

the only metrics available in gridcoin for voting that satisfy this property are metrics that are verifiably linear: balance and balance + magnitude. this is why in fern all other forms of voting metrics were deprecated besides those two. the others are subject to trivial sybil attacks and are invalid.

note that since we cannot reliably uniquely identify individuals voting, the quorum qualification rules must also follow the same concept. they must be based on sybil proof measures. this is what gives rise to the avw % metric, which also satisfies the above property of linearity as a voting metric, and is the best metric we have to judge whether a quorum has been met, given that we cannot use the number of votes cast.

the above may be a bit abstract and deep for many folks, but it is exceedingly important to understand. the same limitations unfortunately give rise to the other concern about voting power concentrated with a few (impossible to reliably identify) individuals with large balances ""whales"", but this is the best we can do without going down that other road of coercively and reliably identifying individuals for one-person, one-vote, voting metrics.",7,,jamescowens,0

1669026338,"futures and options are about using today's price and price history, to guess/bet on/protect against future price changes - both the price and time difference (how much price will change, and how long it'll take to do so).

both are ""derivative"" products because all of the price calculations are based on the stock that the future/option are based on. for example the future value of aapl would look at the current and historical stock prices, so aapl stock is the underlying stock on which its future/option contract's price is derived.

option contracts, as the name suggests, are (somewhat) optional. if the *buyer* ends up losing, they can opt-out of the purchase (only lose the initial investment but not go negative)... but that can also mess up the seller, so there is additional calculations into the price to account for it.

why this exists...

companies can use future contracts to ""hedge"" their purchases, so that if the price of a product increases between order and delivery (maybe a tanker of oil, which takes a while to order and ship and deliver), that the fututes/options market can ""cover"" the price difference... for example, i can order a tanker of oil ($10 for easy math), and option contracts for the same amount of oil (extra $1); if the price goes up before it reaches me (goes to $15), the options contract will pay / cover the increase between when i ordered it (15 - 10 = 5 difference)... so by including the option contract, i can order today, and be safe from price changes by the time it arrives)

this is incredibly ironic to accuse me of being disingenuous given how disingenuous your post is...

first, microsoft stock owners were never clamoring that web3 was going to revolutionize the company, and in fact, **never really talked about it**.  **contrast this with gme holders who like to constantly talk about the nft marketplace** (or at least were, before it turned out to be a complete failure).

furthermore, we absolutely did mock microsoft for going into crypto as well.  here are two examples -  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buttcoin/comments/cicp55/microsoft_smashes_two_favorite_buzzwords_together/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buttcoin/comments/nbbcq3/microsoft_is_quietly_shutting_down_its_azure/)

[microsoft shut down their blockchain service over a year ago because it was a failure.](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/)  so not really surprising that we don't talk about it anymore.  if you have any more disingenuous comparisons that you want me to debunk, let me know.

i've seen a lot of trolling and fud the last few days. so let us break down the noise:

1. first off, the people using p/e clearly don't understand the purpose of p/e. you don't use p/e to measure the profitability of a company that isn't quite designed to be as profitable as possible. this same reason is why many of you would have never bought apple, amazon, etc., at their early stages and would have made enough $ to retire by now.
2. ""but their market cap is higher than all the other automakers combined."" that's because traditionally, auto companies have never been valued highly in the market. why? because it's a low-growth business... the market was saturated with ice vehicles, no differentiation between products, and a lack of innovation. hence, people didn't really care for the auto companies in the markets. it was boring and while they made good profit that was being distributed via dividends, people largely stayed away from auto companies. just look a their historical stock performance... the ath for ford was two decades ago. and a lot of you might not realise this but in 2008, gm and chrysler got hit badly. why? because consumer financing with a broken economy meant gm and chrysler had a pile of debt that consumers couldn't pay off. these auto companies are highly leveraged. a bad economy means they will have piles of vehicles that consumers can't afford to finance again.
3. tesla changed the auto industry. this is undeniable. ask yourself, when was the last time the auto industry was this interesting? when was the last time you saw these auto companies actually start to innovate? never, until tesla shook the market. and that's why people are betting highly on tesla. they're the ones innovating in a brand new industry. and yes, ev's are a brand new industry. it's why auto companies are spending billions trying to revamp or create new manufacturing plants. it's why they are having huge supply chain shortages particularly for ev's. it's why gm had to pause sales on their chevy bolt for over 7 months because they had an exploding battery issue. new industry, not the same as ice. same way renewable energy products are different from oil. both can be used as energy generation fuel but they are entirely different in composition. ford's ceo even openly admits that they are trying to copy tesla. gm's ceo, mary barra, her entire ev strategy is literally what tesla did..... like 6 years ago.
4. what's the p/e of vw, ford, gm, toyota, honda, etc., if you only include their ev segment? because that's what matters here and that is what many of you are are missing. tesla isn't in the business of competing against other ev companies as much as they are in the business of taking market share from ice companies. right now, outside of luxury ev models such as the porsche taycan, there are no profitable ev's other than tesla's. and it will be that way for many more years. so if you're going to be fair and start comparing p/e of these ev initiatives, at least look at the broader comparison. why compare ice vehicles, a dying industry, to ev vehicles? look across the board: almost every auto company in the world are looking to stop selling ice vehicles by 2040 (latest). california already plans to ban ice sales by 2035. using the p/e and market cap of an ice company to compare against an ev company is the same logic as saying 'why buy apple stock when they released the iphone instead of nokia?' they both sold phones and nokia had a much larger revenue/profit than apple at that time. there were many apple pessimists who made such claims... stating that no one wanted a touch screen phone, it's a fad, it won't last, etc.,
5. tesla already has the highest margins in the auto business outside of exotic luxury vehicles. think about it from this perspective: while other auto companies lose money for every ev they sell, tesla makes the highest in the industry for every ev they sell. that's because tesla is the most vertically integrated auto company in the world dating back to the fact that many of their parts couldn't be purchased elsewhere and they had to use cost-saving measures due to the fact that they were on the verge of bankruptcy. that mindset led to tesla constantly innovating in engineering. their gigastamp is a revolutionary process in creating the vehicle chassis and significantly reduces costs. even the car seats are made by tesla. the software, made by tesla. batteries are made by tesla and with strong emphasis on 4680, they will likely be one of the biggest battery makers in the future as well. auto companies historically do not do this type of shit. they are just assembly lines. they get the parts and build the car. while that's a good thing for ice, it's a bad thing for ev's. software is the biggest key here. vw recently came out and stated that their software will likely be outsourced to apple instead... aka, apple carplay. they don't even know how to improve their software. meanwhile, tesla is capable of creating software allowing them to play steam games, push ota updates to perform self-driving features, improve vehicle performance, improve firmware for their cameras. much like how you would buy a laptop or phone, the software capabilities for a vehicle will largely be the differentiation as competition increases.
6. tesla is already going to be the most profitable auto company in the u.s. by this year. by next year, they will be the most profitable auto company in the world. for reference, tesla only became profitable on an annual basis in 2020. so in a span of five years, they would have went from being unprofitable to being the most profitable auto company. the numbers are insane when you look at it... per vehicle sold, tesla is already the most profitable company. automakers like vw and toyota largely made vehicles that are low profit-per-unit but they earn money through high volume. if they can't push towards more ev sales in the future, they are going to be toast. bmw and benz are high profit automakers. yet, neither of them sell any ev's that are affordable compared to their ice version. the performance of those ice versions also significantly outperform their ev's so in a sense, there is no incentive to purchase their ev's currently. toyota doesn't even believe in bev's. they are still of the mindset that hydrogen fuel is the way to go because after spending billions of $, they are too stubborn to admit it was a failure. all they push out are hybrids and they did so because they wanted to meet the regulatory standards and not be hit with a carbon tax. they are falling behind..... so let me guess, tesla is a cult? in two years, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world while selling a product (ev's) that other automakers will be losing money selling. sign me up!
7. i've been following tesla since 2014... believe me, the amount of criticism that tesla gets today pales in comparison to what they received in 2018 when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. this is peanuts. it went from, 'ev's are a fad, tesla can't mass manufacture ev's, they will be bankrupt, they're only profitable because of regulatory credits, other competition is coming (oh, really, the same automakers who pledge to go fully ev in 15 years but the competition is coming...?). heard it all by now. this isn't anything new.
8. not even going to go on about their energy storage capabilities, supercharging network, ai expertise (currently the largest ai company in the world), robotics (watch their ai event next week), tesla insurance, no dealership model, fsd, etc.,... those are things you can either choose to believe or not believe in. i'm more focused on the fact that they are the only company even willing to engage in all of this. that shows me a company that is constantly innovating. the very fact tesla does all this while other automakers don't should tell you one thing: they don't have the expertise nor are they focused on shareholder value. hence, why auto companies have been terrible performers in the stock market for the past two decades until tesla ignited the ev formula and now you're seeing companies like byd, nio, xpeng, lucid, rivian, etc., all pop up trying to take market from the ice segment. remember, they are not competing against each other as much as they are competing for the ice sales.this dude runs a company that builds rockets and wants to take civilization to mars.... think about that for a second. you might say it's stupid and i would probably agree with you. but this is the type of person you are dealing with. once he stepped into the auto business, it became revolutionised. once he went into the aero industry, he revolutionised it. this is not a person you want to bet against and the market will find that even more evident when tesla and spacex both become top five companies in the world by market cap.

beside even if you feel marvel's quality has been dropping after the russo brother have left, [the reviews from audience and critics are still relatively consistent](https://wikiofnerds.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/mcu-data-1068x423.jpg.webp). in addition, this is just phase 4, don't you think is a little too early to call it bad? is like saying you 10 course meal sucks because, the 4 item is not up to your liking.

and you can't deny whatever marvel has been doing, in general is working. is like my friends trying to shit on apple or even get their parents to sell their apple stock because they feel is going to drop or stop being exciting after steve jobs died but forgot to see other metrics like apple just hit 3 trillion mark or despite having 20% of smartphones market, they have 80% of the smartphone profits. i understand is an orange to apple comparsion but i think you get the point.",13,,Taellion,0

1669197859,"i dont know about pricing on the gen 2. but if it is fairly close i think meta should go for it. balls to the walls! my reasons for bttw:

1. if it's a 3 year cycle for the quests they should aim high. the ramp up of quest tech development cant be +50% per gen. 2.5x is more on track. the promised metaverse they want to get to is very power hungry.
2. these playstation 1 looking metaverse avatars are not compelling to regular non gaming people. to us they look cute/charming though. to regular people they look cartoony and much worse than simple webcam. and we need to have crowds of really detailed avatars ideally. low tech won't do.
3. pico will release annually, iterating quickly, possibly make q3 look old. also apple, pimax, valve seem to wan't to compete soon. all with their own app-stores.
4. meta stock tanking 75% in a year they need to melt minds to show that they are at the heart of xr. or investor will loose faith in vr. like they melted before with q1 and q2 (and a bit with q pro)
5. better gpu will make games more compelling, which sells more so maybe it could pay for itself even if they subsidized the q3 price. $50-$60 games would be self-evident value.
6. i think most quest 2 die hard fans would gladly pay $499 for a graphically impressive upgrade with a nice (qled?) screen. the quest base is hooked hard. the fence-sitting vr fans can buy up the used quest 2s that will be flooding the markets.
7. ar/hand tracking will do good with a little bit of ai magic. needs that power.
8. like the graph shows. qualcomm is no longer the sole gatekeeper keeping the field even. meta could rely up to recently on other devices not being able to outcompete their xr2 so meta wins by having the best store. now mediatek showed that they can compete with their new dimensity 9200 chips and opens up for cheaper competitors even at quest 3 launch. 

i could also see the argument for the cheap quest 3 to get to 50 million users. and that strategy works for enthusiast if there are 2 tiers (regular and pro), but the pro tier is not yet ready for us i think. and the pro tier seemed to be too much focused on just enterprise this time around. maybe for the time being it should be more strong single device like ps5.",6,,Useful44723,0

on june 17, nancy pelosi’s husband paul pelosi exercised options he had purchased a year earlier to purchase 20,000 shares of stock in semiconductor manufacturing company nvidia at a price of **$100 per share**, according to a disclosure filed by the speaker.

nvidia shares traded at between **$160 and $169** the following day.

**two days after pelosi bought the stocks, the senate voted to proceed to consider a bill that would provide about $52 billion in subsidies over the next five years to the u.s. semiconductor industry. nvidia stock jumped to around $181 a share following that vote.** 

**trades like that have stoked suspicion that paul pelosi, an investment banker, may be making stock trades based on non-public information he receives from his wife.**

frankly, i don't really like this strategy because it ties up a huge amount of buying power for a long period of time with no real benefit to you because it is essentially a sure thing you are going to get assigned as expiry approaches.  the only way it is very beneficial is if you get a large rally that drops the value substantially due to the strong delta component and you can buy it back with a hefty profit if the move is strong and fast enough.",2,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0

though if you look at watchcharts, you'll find that a lot of luxury watches' price have tanked with the bear market. seems like a good buying opportunity.

and while historical price is a poor predictor of future, i'd like to hold luxury watches because:

1. it looks cool
2. as a long term hold, it's hard to see that the watches will lose value forever.
3. the probability of a watch's value going to $0 compared to say meta stock going to $0 is much lower (though not impossible). this is mainly due to the fact that even a fairly mediocore watch that can tell time is worth a few bucks at least.

also, i feel the best way to make a lot of money is margins on big ticket items. think cars, houses, etc. watches is also in that category but shipping is a bit cheaper.

i need to do more research, but i feel like rolex (namely submariner / oyster perpetuals) is a good pick because there's a fair amount of liquidity when trading these. same for ap's royal oaks. but i wouldn't be comfortable trying to flip a more obscure model since i wouldn't be sure that i could sell it should the price rise.

the process is similar to those trying to flip houses, where you basically spam mildly low-ball offers and hope for a quick sale.",10,,bobbyswinson,0

1669373639,"you want sources, fine:

because wage data for a lot of eu countries is only quarterly, we will look at the most recent release (q2) that is available for everyone. for the uk, where the data is monthly, i will for the sake of simplicity, use the reference end month of the quarter, it doesn't make much difference anyway. furthermore, because the pandemic caused all sorts of noise in the employment data (due to things like furlough), we will go back to q2 2019. so, now lets look at realised wage growth in both nominal and real terms over the last 3 years.

- uk: [average weekly earnings](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/november2022), total pay was £538 in june 2019 and £612 in june 2022. so, 13.8% nominal wage growth over the past 3 years. [realised inflation](https://www.rateinflation.com/consumer-price-index/uk-cpi/) over the same period was 13.5% - index went from 107.93 to 121.79. so, all together we have roughly 0.3% positive real wage growth. 

- now lets look at the eurozone as a whole. [compensation per employee](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?series_key=320.mna.q.y.i8.w2.s1.s1._z.com_ps._z._t._z.ix.v.n) (their analogue of awe) has gone from 107.3 in q2 2019 to 115.11 in q2 2022 (this is a normalised index rather than euro values, but it measures the same thing). so wage growth in the euro bloc was 7.2% over the past 3 years. now, euro area inflation, as measured by hicp, went from 104.8 in june 2019 to 116.3 in june 2022, or 11.0% cumulative. combining these, we find that real wage growth in the euro area has been -3.8% over the past 3 years.

so, as i said originally, not only has nominal wage growth massively outperformed in the uk compared to the eurozone, but it's also considerably better in real terms. i can drill down into individual eu countries if you want, the conclusion is the same. on that point, in a separate comment i give the values for [germany](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/z3gecf/uk_sees_highest_net_migration_since_second_world/ixpo5o9/), with sources, which shows that *nominal* wages rose a measly 4.2% in the past 3 years. 

now, i wonder if you have the decency to admit that i was right?",6,,kanyewestsconscience,0

1669418869,"that is a valid question. something to consider is the amount of hedge funds that did pile into the long side of the trade during the last run. on reddit, we assume that hedge funds are always against us. but that is not accurate. sure sometimes we are up against a hedge fund, but not all hedge funds. you see hedge funds don’t care about what side they are on, but making a profit. i see there was a comment in here about questioning why a hedge fund would want to destroy the very nature or structure that made them a billionaire, but there are flaws in this logic. again, a hedge fund only makes money. when they profit, they get a cut of all their profits. i believe there are hedge funds that are watching us waiting to see if we reach a critical mass to then pile in. the name of the game in trading, and in options is to not only be right, but to be right on the right timeframe. remember when we all used to trade options there were times when we won big but more often we lost because options have time decay. so if a hedge fund plans to use derivatives to pile in with us then they have to wait until the right time. to further exemplify that not all hedge funds are on the same team let’s explore a case study from carl ichans hbo documentary. there is a trade in that documentary that covers apple stock. it was carl icahn against bill ackman. carl notoriously won this trade. an opinion i have is that ackman may be patiently plotting against carl. this is complete speculation, but what if ackman is waiting to jump in to blow up carls short position? 

this was a ramble and stream of consciousness, but hedge funds and institutional money managers need to trade covertly. if it is to apparent or too obvious - a bunch of small fish come and eat away profits.

this is where i believe we can have immense power by adopting a school of fish approach. i think we will see hedge funds and households join in, but we have been sitting at a wall.

1669427427,it's the same as messing with the odds pools on betting. put too much into it and suddenly it's worthless because the odds change. you buying up all the apple stock early makes the ripples in the market that day traders notice and they're all buying it up because it's hot. stocks aren't about actual value anymore they're about perceived value and if you make it look like it's worth buying people will buy it and try to sell it off. now if you time it right you could pull it off but odds are you'd create a bubble where people dogpile on to the buy and once they realize apple isn't worth the asking price it tanks to nothing or at least flattens out to reasonable price. still it'll be hard to balance the bubble pop and your investment just right without extra time travel steps but stocks aren't a limited commodity when first hitting the market.,1,,Darthtypo92,0
1669427798,"if we’re going to play the game where we pick very specific examples over very short periods of time to prove a point sure… if this person had decided to sell mid-august they would have had more profit than they’ve had to today. picking a tailored example over a short time period doesn’t really prove much, another counterpoint would be the dozens of weekly posts from people treating their max profit on cc as some kind of insane loss.

really though your linked post just proves my point. you can have the option premium or the long term gains but you cannot have both. why? because you’re selling the right to the long term gains to get the option premiums and you otherwise need to buy it back with more time or more money. in the example you linked the person kept option premium but there was no stock gains to weigh it against. if aapl stock had gone from $150 to $300 during that time period (which is something a long term holder would love) then this person would have severely underperformed the person doing nothing.

hoping the stock doesn’t go up until later when you want it to isn’t a strategy. sorry buddy.",4,,pfthrowaway5130,0
1669430326,"hi - i'm new here.  lurked for a short while, but just started posting today.

just wanted to say that this page is hilarious (lots of self-deprecating humor in the light of a crushed stock...been there, know the feeling!...i used to own $meta...).  i find palantir's service quite unique and interesting.  i've listened to a lot of amit kukreja's $pltr videos on youtube, in addition to the everything money channel's valuation/analysis of the stock (they like it around $5-6).  not a shareholder currently, but interested at the $6 range or lower.  some questions:

a.)  what is the non-government and non-large enterprise customer prospects/tam for palantir?  can a small or medium business afford and/or benefit from palantir?

b.)  is the current insider selling at all worrisome for you guys?

c.)  is their service that unique and does it have a durable advantage/moat, such that a big company couldn't just spend a ton of money and create the same product?  i think of alphabet with \~150 billion in cash and that could buy palantir \~10x over (it's market cap is \~15b).  it owns deep mind, which is arguably the world's most advanced a.i. firm.  could alphabet utilize its cash + a.i. know-how and replicate/compete with/surpass palantir's product if it wanted to?

d.)  would there be an eventual conflict of interest amongst its potential customers?  e.g., what if coca-cola uses palantir and it solves some unique problems for it.  palantir sees a similar problem for its competitor, pepsi, and now has a template for how to solve this problem.  would it be ethical to help pepsi solve that same problem ?  what if the nature of the solution for coke was an offensive strategy against pepsi?  could/should palantir give pepsi info. on how they helped coke?",0,,solodav,0

1669436216,"nothing wrong with starting dividend investing at a young age.

but at your age you should focus more on high growth and low yield div holdings like $msft and others alike. at your age you are at great position to gain from growth holdings.

once you start getting older you can start shifting your focus more towards mid growth and mid yield div holdings.

eventual when you are close to retirement or are retired something to the equivalent to the us holding $jepi would be a good option to shift focus to for income.

believe me dividend investing is a slow and boring process, but it will bring you financial security when you decide to retire.

1669448533,"didn't go through all the answers but it's because **in theory** every company reaches steady state due to **competition**, ie roic becomes equal to wacc and there's no useful place for the company's capital anymore -&gt; 100% dividend payout after depreciation and all that.

so the question is what are you willing to pay **now** to get this steady state dividend(ssd) payout **in the future**? if the company is not at steady state, it should be growing, ie. the future ssd should be growing. if you've heard talking heads refer to tech companies as 'the longest duration asset', it's the same concept.

to make this point concrete, look at aapl's past prices. right before and after the 08 crises, it was at $3-5 a share. were they in steady state? if not, what did their growth outlook and final steady state size look like at the time? today aapl most likely is **still** not in steady state, and growing, but slower obv bc they are paying out $0.9 a share(ie. they are generating too much cash to reinvest at a rate &gt; wacc, so some is paid out in dividends)

so the investor who looked at the numbers in 2008 and answered the above questions ""way the fuk bigger"" would be sitting on a 18-30% annual bond right now in aapl stock($0.9 annual dividend return off their cost of $3-5 in 2008). ontop of that, they reap any future growth of aapl.

edit: and obv the market won't stand by idly if something as stable as aapl is paying out 18-30% annually, which is why the share price gets re-rated higher.

tl;dr - buying a growth stock is holding your place in line for future ssd payouts. the art of stock picking is determining which companies will reach a much larger steady state in the future and how quickly they'll get there",1,,yabadabadoomf,0

market cap calculation has always been stock price multiplied by total amount of issued shares. this is what we’ve been talking about here. price or amount of the options was not even considered as it’s not relevant at this stage of the bet. this is only relevant when calculating how much op will lose, but not about the underlying in the bet he made, which is that the share price (not options price) will change from 148.11 (aapl stock price right now) to 141 (options strike price that op bought) or preferably actually less. this move of the share price from 148.11 to 141 would equal to a change in market cap of aapl of about 113b dollar. (15.91b x 148.11 versus 15.91b x 141).

because it's possible. a 10% increase in value on 8bn is greater than a 100% increase in value on 400m.

the stadium also becomes an asset when it's built. that adds value greater when it comes time to sell. look at liverpool...you think fsg expanded the stadium for the love of it? 

and investors are not looking at increasing the value based on todays market. they're seeing the market in general getting bigger in future and then trying to gain % from that. so look at the new cl format. more games = more money.

1669556969,"totally get what you’re feeling, but what i do is just try and reframe things as much as i can.

it’s easy to fall into a trap of looking at past home prices and feeling depressed over it if you’re not bought in because you were *going* to buy.  but in reality, it’s no different than being upset you didn’t buy apple stock at $4 or whatever.  hindsight being 20/20 and all

or, to put it another way, everyone you’re looking at with all that equity also purchased after significant home value inflation too.  just over a longer period.

buying in 2019 was nice.  2018 would be better.  as would 2017.  2010 for sure.  etc.

you can get into a spiral of when the best time to buy was, and it’s *usually* going to be at a point in the past.  but that was true for all the people who purchased who you’re thinking of too.  they likely didn’t buy at the best time either.",7,,Apptubrutae,0

1669626601,"that's not the point. the point is that the ""main"" thrust of this is just not true. in fact, the thrust of the entire piece is completely wrong. the whole premise is that you have an infinite amount of money to invest in stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. the implication being that if you invest it all, eventually you'll get rich.

the argument is that this is not what people mean when they say, ""invest your money."" it's just a fancy way of saying that you can't ever ""stop"" investing it.

the premise is false. you can invest in any asset class, regardless of your wealth. so if you're poor and don't have any assets, then you can invest all your money in stocks (assuming you have enough money in your savings to make that happen).

the argument is also false. if you invest in any asset class at all, you will always end up losing money. because any one asset class can lose money. if you invest in the same asset class as everyone else, the losses become even more pronounced. if you invest a million dollars in oil futures and 5,000 shares of microsoft stock, then the cost per share is $2.50. it's a loss of $1.05.

and then the other side of the coin is that there are many things that can be added to any investment portfolio, including debt. in fact, one of the greatest advantages of having a high income is that you can buy more debt. so the more debt you have, the more you can invest in stocks.

the bottom line is this: no one has ever claimed that you can never ""stop"" investing in anything.",1,,NickBotGPT,0

so what we needed was a layer where if a mac os 7.0 application wrote to a file using a mac os 7.0 file system call, it was ""translated"" to a unix file system call to write the file out to the unix file system.  then the same for reading a file.  taking mouse and keyboard input events and feeding them into the mac os 7.0 event queue. if quickdraw drew a line into what it thought was the mac os 7.0 screen, display that in the unix screen (which was running x-windows).  if you inserted a floppy disk into the mac hardware that was a unix level event that needed to be ""mounted"" by unix as a filesystem, but then exposed to the macintosh os process as an icon on the desktop representing a floppy that could be double-clicked to be browsed by the finder, etc, etc.  that is what the a/ux team did.  about half the team worked on unix, and half the team worked on ""how legacy apps like macwrite and excel run on top of that unix"".

when next came into apple i was no longer there.  but much of the same compatibility layer had to be built, and the a/ux team members were uniquely aware of all of the issues and completely ""up to speed"" on working with unix, so they helped work on the solution.  the hybrid of next kernel and yet also compatible with previous apple executables was the result.  following that was apple 3rd party developers could develop their apps as separate memory protected processes, and following that after a few years apple end of lifed that compatibility layer.  but it was all a big slow always compatible migration built by hundreds of software engineers.

funny random story: a good software engineer named jeff glasson (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jglasson/) worked on the unix kernel at a/ux.  while i was still at apple (1994) he decided to change jobs and companies and took a job at next working on the next kernel.  at the time i said to him, ""dude, next doesn't look like it will be successful, why?""  he had a very practical response: ""i like working on unix kernels, i'll get some good experience.""  i left apple to work at sgi, but then very soon after (a couple years later) apple acquired next and jeff was back inside apple working on unix kernel, but now part of the very core os team at apple building mac os x, and since next was acquired he got a big payday out of his next stock!!  plus he had skills getting unix to run on apple hardware and was familiar with the a/ux team.  jeff worked at apple for another 9 years after that, lol.  

never take any career advice from me, i can't seem to predict the future.  jeff taking a job at next meant he ended back at apple but with more money and more apple stock than if he had stayed at apple the whole time.  apple is famous for re-instating your employee number if you return, so his employee number didn't even change.  best career move ever, and i thought it was dubious at the time.",2,,brianwski,0

so in this one store nvidia stock is outpacing amd by 3x and the stock of 3070 + 3070tis alone is equivalent to the entirety of the amd stock.

this backs up nvidia's pricing of the 4000 series as a driver of 3000 series sales. they were likely not expecting the bottom to fall out of the market over the summer and are now in the weird position of needing to sell a bunch of last-gen cards while their new cards are releasing. amd doesn't have this issue since they just didn't expect sales and didn't produce cards.",3,,GoalAccomplished8955,0

i've seen how they calculate the value of a company in private equity / vc because i worked in multiple tech startups. it's entirely made up, and frankly an exercise in selling early to a greater fool.

on the publicly traded side you can dig a bit deeper on market cap calculations and realize nobody is buying all the shares for the list price used in market cap calculations (that is if you pay attention to the order book).

however, often a person's assets converted to market cap will determine how much ""equity"" they have, and thus influence what kind of loans they can take out or whether they make the forbes 100 or not.

it's all made-up voodoo. someone, somewhere decided on a magic formula to put a value on a company or an asset like a cryptocurrency, and then we all just accepted it or were manipulated into doing so.

for example for publically traded assets: every seller needs a buyer and vice versa, however, them agreeing is tantamount to making a transaction possible. if a person is unwilling to buy apple stock, or bitcoin, or whatever for x usd, however, that's what the seller is asking for, well, the transaction doesn't happen.

it's asinine to say that market cap = number of shares in circulation \* current price in that environment. you have to further think about how many people will pay said price to own the asset.

why do you think kanye went from billionaire to several millionaire overnight? it wasn't because he lost that much money in real terms. it was because his assets (aka brands) were suddenly worth far less in the magical mba or mfa formulas that are slightly more complicated than the market cap formula i mentioned, but, nowhere near complicated enough to model what's actually happening.

the real reason kanye took a hit to his finances (really his assets, and his ability to get debt, and not a hit to his liquidity) was due to the hit to his popularity. people were suddenly less willing to buy his brand based on seeing the fallout of his most recent manic episode.

when popularity (brand) is what determines value you know you have a problem, because that's volatile as fuck. people turn on each other on a dime today.

the long story short is that if a person convinces you that a thing is worth x to you, then it is. however it's not really worth that if other people aren't willing to pay close to the same. it's really worth some weighted average that factors in the number of people willing to buy a thing, how much they want, and for what price they're willing to buy it.

therein lies the problem. people, collectively, can basically make whatever economic reality they want for the value of some asset, but it is rooted in group-think.

this also highlights a problem with cryptocurrency. if you take an objective view, you will notice it's kinda a cult mentality. it's a lot of people virtue signaling with posts that are anti-fiat and anti-government, and also soothing posts playing up the ""future"" of said technologies. it's all to promote you exchanging your value for their ""value"", and to encourage you to join the cult and accept the value measurement they sold you. you can see it if you pay attention to how every post, new article, etc. is trying to convince you to buy, to hold, etc.

this is why cryptocurrency, stocks, and so on are all part of the same speculative, cultural phenomenon and it could all be characterized as a bubble. we're collectively agreeing to very subjective ways of putting a value on various assets, however, our agreement is also being manipulated by social media, news, etc. because we all want to belong and dream of being rich.",1,,DorkRockGalactic,0

for diy -- here's what i want you to do:  play some what-if games.  figure out what the modest house you'd buy would cost, and play with a mortgage calculator.

i'm assuming the house will cost more per month than rent does today.  but...it won't go up much.  taxes will go up, insurance will go up, but for a standard mortgage, the actual mortgage payment (p&amp;i) will not.  dig in to see what p is and what i is.  look to see how fast your share of the home increases and the bank's share of the home decreases.

if you all get a 30 year mortgage, you'll be 70 and he'll be 78, and that's not a great place to be - on social security and still paying your mortgage.  on the other hand, p&amp;i will still be the same as it was when you bought.  and remember:  the only way to ""spend"" the house on health care is to sell it and find someplace else to live.  if you put the money on apple, it'll probably be a lot easier and certainly less disruptive to sell and spend the proceeds from a few shares of apple stock.  that assumes, of course, that apple is still around in 30 years.",2,,micha8st,0

i have both traditional and roth money in my 401k.  and my 401k doesn't allow me to invest the money differently between traditional and roth...kind of, anyway.  if i decide to sell the large cap growth fund and split it between small cap index and international index, then they take all the money, both traditional and roth out of the large cap growth fund and split it as i directed.

vti (vanguard total stock index fund) contains 4028 stocks and meta makes up 0.55% of the total portfolio.  choosing to avoid vti or other broad market indices and funds simply because they include meta is a ridiculously extreme stance to take.

i'm not advocating for investing directly in meta stock nor in small funds that have significant exposure to it, but avoiding it entirely is a bad decision given that its presence in the s&amp;p 500 will place it in most broad market indices and funds.  you're basically limiting yourself to small &amp; mid cap funds and sector-specific funds which carry a very difference risk profile.",1,,FleetAdmiralFader,0

1669767672,"ballmer probably is one of the very few billionaires out there who has actual cash flow and so therefore can buy whatever he wants whenever he wants. what i mean by that is that he was an early leader and ceo of msft, which has long since reached maturity and has been growing and giving dividends for years. elon? no cash. gotta sell stuff for cash. bezos? same thing. and dividends get preferential tax treatment compared to stock sales.

so ballmer has a net worth of 80 billion. if we assume just 1/3rd is msft, that's still 343 million dollars a year that he brings in on only dividends just from his msft stock. i mean, what expenses does he actually have anyway? he has no expensive hobbies that we know of outside of basketball.

he could fund 100 million in luxury taxes without blinking an eye forever if he wanted to without ever dipping into revenue from the actual franchise.

it's insane just how powerful this man is in the world of sports. if bezos sold 5 billion dollars of amzn stock to pay 2 billion for a franchise, he'd only have half a billion left over due to taxes, which would allow him to bankroll the same 100 million for only 5 years. then he'd have to pray that the stock would go up do that he wouldn't have to make his ownership stake go down by too much of a percent.

nobody has as much freedom as ballmer just because he has so much dividend income from msft. for anything that does not actually cost more than 5 billion dollars, he is in a weird way richer than bezos and musk in a practical sense.",31,,hangliger,0

1669824461,"ok fine, i will get sucked in for one more comment.

i think you are misunderstanding what is being said here.

i would not advocate for you buying meta stock, as i think it's a trash stock that won't be around in 10 years, no matter the price. i don't care if the price of the stock has gone up 100% in the last year, or if it's gone down 80%.  a crappy company is a crappy company no matter the price point. maybe meta isn't the best example if you believe in their product, i don't. i used meta vs apple because i believe apple is one of the best run companies in the world, and meta is going bankrupt in a decade. 

lets look at cn rail as a counter example.  cn rail stock is up 18% in the last 6 months, and is a stock i have owned for over 15 years.  i'm not going to sell that stock just because it's gone up and pick up another stock that has been losing. i think it is a solid company, i'm not going to sell solely because it's made me money.  
and thankfully i haven't, as my cn rail holdings are up 769%, yes 769%.  my initial investment of 2500 is now worth just below 22,000.  i'm really grateful i didn't sell 10 years ago, just because the stock went up.

you are essentially saying, that you don't care what the company is, if its up sell, and if it is down buy. this makes no sense.  doing this over time you will end up with a smaller and smaller position in the good companies, and a growing and growing position in crappy ones.

i have never said to buy low, or buy high, or sell low, or sell high.   if you are going to pick stocks, which it really sounds like you shouldn't be doing anyway, you do that based on the quality of the company you are buying.  you dca into the companies you believe in and then you constantly re-evaluate the company.  you don't try to time the market.

i can assure you that your system isn't as good as you think it is.",1,,TheDrSmooth,0

the bakers refusal is based around his religious views, but the sentiment was that its a private business and he shouldn't be forced to do something he doesn't want to do. its his business to be run the way he wishes.

now if republicans want to buy enough apple stock to influence the company to go a different direction, i think they should persue that. they should put their money where their mouth is.",1,,philodendrin,0

1669839420,"in my opinion, the income that people get from actually working (salary/wages) should be taxed at a lower rate than the money people get from doing nothing other than simply already having money (capital gains).

if i take money my dad left me when he died and buy a bunch of apple stock, then sell it a year later for a $100,000 profit….. why should i pay less tax on that income than someone who actually worked a whole year as a productive member of society to earn a $100,000 wage? 

those apple stocks didn’t contribute to society in any way, i didn’t buy them from apple, so that money didn’t go to growing apple as company, i bought them from some anonymous random people on a stock exchange. (some who lost money on the transaction and some who gained, impossible to know who or how much)  i clicked “buy” on a website, then did absolutely nothing productive for an entire year before clicking “sell” on a website. why does that deserve greater reward (a lower tax rate) than actually working a productive job for an entire year?


having income being taxed at a higher rate than capital gains just rewards the idle rich for already being rich while punishing everyone else for having the audacity to actually work for a living.        

if anything capital gains should be taxed higher than or equal to salary/wages.    people aren’t gonna stop investing, no one ever said “i’m not gonna grow my money because a portion of that growth will go to taxes”",1,,Turdulator,0
