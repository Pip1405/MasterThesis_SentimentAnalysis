if something has high beta because the stock moves a lot, it should be more risky? hell no, if you like the stock you want it to be volatile.

if a business has 99% debt and 1% equity, it will have lower wacc and therefore less risky? hell no, it's a crappy business.

just use a rate of return that you absolutely demand to earn. the rest is making sure the future cash flows are conservative enough. i use 10.4% as it is the annual return of s&amp;p500 on average and i want to beat it, and the result is that $fb is cheapest.

1648773355,"yes. a tardis is basically a perfect home. it can go anywhere, any when, you can customise the interior and exterior at your leisure, and it basically has an infinite internal supply of food and drink, since it has a food dispenser, for anything you can imagine, and a few things you can't.

even if it was limited to just travelling anywhere on the world, or the solar system in reasonable time, and no time travel, that's still nothing to sneeze at, and would solve almost all the problems we have today.

if it wasn't conscious, i'd be very tempted to buy one, and knowing what we do now, spend some time studying it, putting some protections around the matrix, and something to make the tardis self sufficient, if it ever loses the connection to the universe, or the eye of harmony. maybe mid it with some other improvements along the way.

the only issue with it being mass produced is that its ability as a time machine would be abused by people who have the resources to get theirs first. people would go to the past and start twiddling with history, either their own, or someone else's for their own ends. things like investing in apple stock or bitcoin early, or attacking historical figures.

verizon is a very good value now. i'd buy it at $50/share but i probably wouldn't want to buy it at $55/share.

most people haven't ever saved a dime in their lives and show up here thinking they will get rich quick if they now all of a sudden dca into bitcoin. people who view crypto as a get rich quick scheme will never get rich. these are the same people who buy lotto tickets irresponsibly, join mlms, sign up for the latest rug pull, etc.

get your fiat life together first before you just start going head into crypto thinking it will get you rich. there was a thread i was in with people talking about how you could get insanely rich off of bitcoin (very few people have), and the comparing that to the average 401k balance of $250k at 65. if you want to compare someone getting extremely lucky with an average retiree, how is that fair? if you could get incredibly lucky with btc/eth or any other coin that 10000x-ed, then you would also have been retired from $tsla, $gme, $aapl, already.

the most cringe posts are the ones that think that crypto is their only way out. it's no different than thinking a lottery ticket is their only way out, which is also why probably most lottery winners end up broke or dead. you don't have to be a genius to learn how to manage and live off a windfall, but most winners unfortunately are in bad financial states to begin with.",8,,cryptoripto123,0

now it gets tricky - in a real world, with fiat money and clear regulations, investors can punish you for not deliviring items, that you have promised to make. of course, then you go to the court, there will be a lawsuit, but at the end of a day - you still will lose a lot of money and nerves. and you would be lucky, if investors decided to fight against you in a law field, otherwise - you could be found dead. 

with crypto tho - there is no regulations. binance still making some shady movements, everybody knows that, but did something happen with binance? no. they fired people? pfff. they implemented some regulations? beg my pardon if you think they stopped doing shady things, i didn't know you are a naive one. 

no one can promise you anything in crypto world, that is why returns of your investment here is so high. because, according to the investment triangle - higher the risk - higher the return. that's why you a here. you want to make money, juts like all of us. so either you play by the rules of a crypto and accept the harsh reality, or you can just go and buy some apple stock for 2% profits in 4 months.

the bad part about putting more money down and paying more toward principal is that all your money is invested in the equity of your house.  it took me three years to accept that i had to move again.  i needed to sell the mcmansion, put stuff in storage, find a short term rental…before i could buy my next place (next place is my final house, my retirement house).

i ended up buying a starter home after selling the mcmansion.  i put enough down so my payment is 1/3 of what it would be to rent it.  in five months, it has appreciated about 10%.  so, i could sell tomorrow with a realtor and probably make a couple thousand profit…sort of.  i mean, if i figured in taxes, insurance and all utilities along with mortgage payment, i wouldn’t have an actual profit, but i’ve always been someone who has to pay to live.  i don’t have a friend or family offering to let me live in their place for free.",2,,Giwu2007,0

when i was a teenager in the 70's, elderly people eating alpo to save money was big news.

i'm not going to tell you how much of that 1500 bucks to put where.  but you do need to keep your goals in mind.

assume that there will be no social security when you get around to retiring.  if there is, great.  but if you *plan on it* and there isn't, you'll be eating alpo for dinner most nights.

diversify your investments.  that means mutual funds mostly.  if you buy an s&amp;p 500 index fund, your money is invested in a bunch of stock.  aapl.  amazon.  comcast.  home depot.  so if something really really bad happens and aapl goes bankrupt?  not a huge deal.

if the same thing happens and half your retirement savings is in apple stock?  you'll be stocking up on alpo.

crypto is the same way.  it's a huge risk, bigger than buying stock in individual companies directly.  maybe you'll win big.  maybe you'll lose big.

my retirement investing is 100% in mutual funds, mostly stock-based funds, about 5% bonds.  we've got what i call mid-term investing also mostly in mutual funds.  but there we also have some gambling.  that's where i've bought stock directly like in toro or unilever or bp.  i don't have crypto, but if i did, i'd consider that gambling as well.

only gamble when everything else is solid and taken care of.

* debt?  don't gamble.
* you want a house and don't have one?  don't gamble.
* you feel like you're behind in your retirement savings?  don't gamble.

i'm in my mid 50s.  the fidelity retirement rule-of-thumb says my retirement account should be worth 8x my current yearly salary.  it's worth 12x...so we've done very well.  just some data points:

* we married 2 years after i graduated college; three months after she did.
* we lived in apartments, paying rent, for 4 years after marrying (and two more years alone, for me)
* we had our first kid 4 years after buying the house.
* i started investing in the 401k as soon as i could -- and back then that was after 1 year in the job.
* i didn't do any other investing besides the 401k until after we bought the house.  once we were able to pay all our expenses without going further into debt, that's when i started investing outside the 401k.

we have to take into account that they secured their own  supply chain over decades to eventually produce their own semi conductor chip (m1). 

as a result, they became one of the few companies able to supply the demand during our recent supply chain issues as oppose to other companies like sony with the ps5 or ford delaying car manufacturing and delivery due to the chip shortage.

and that’s just one part of apple’s business model. they have a whole financial side with their credit card and soon they will develop their own financing system to avoid using 3rd party financing companies like affirm.

there seems to be a lottt of places where they can generate significant revenue. so the phone may look the same but the tech inside of them is changing for the better and so is the whole companies business model with it.

so i feel for ppl’s sentiment about the aesthetic of the phone not changing much. i just don’t think it’s due to job’s passing leading to the lack of design innovation.

i say this because if we look back from 2007 to 2011 the phone’s design never really deviated from its core curved edge shape (iphone, 3g, 3gs). it only became the more popular square edge shape a year before job’s passing with the iphone 4 in 2010. then back again to the curved corners with iphone 6/6 plus in 2014 a full 3 years after job’s passing in 2011.

but really the look of the phone is not nearly enough of a catalyst for big institutions to be heavily weighted on aapl stock. everything else i mentioned pertaining their diverse business model, proprietary tech and supply chain security is what interest investors like buffet the most.

i’m speculating that after they’ve established and diversified their revenue streams that they’ll then focus again on innovating the exterior of the phone itself. having a cooler looking phone won’t separate them from competition but developing and owning better technology will.",2,,SignificantSelection,0

here's what would happen if all 42k holders  burned  14 billion coins each!!   (about $200)

a)   first off,  in crypto investing,  $200 is pretty much nothing ... it's a very small insignificant amount of money .  the reality of it is,  if you consider $200 a very significant amount of money,  investing in something that's a little less risky, perhaps amazon or apple stock( both of which are good investments &amp; you'll average a fair roi over several years, with considerably less risk) . now understand that's not meant to discourage those that can only afford a couple hundred dollars and decide to buy cats with it!!  there's nothing wrong with that either,

another (related) point of view is that, loosely speaking, v.n is the rate at which the flux through an area grows grows as that area is increased. that's not well-defined for finite areas, since the *shape* of the area could matter, but it is well-defined in the area --&gt; 0 limit.",4,,InfanticideAquifer,0

1649106383,"so... i'm going to reveal what an awful human i am right now. here's my honest take on your situation, written as if i were in your shoes.

yes, i have placed myself into a position where my business decisions have the potential to greatly impact the lives of dozens of people. it is more difficult than usual because of the proximity; as my profits go up, i can materially witness how raised rents, enforcement of standards and evictions put increasing strain on a vulnerable socioeconomic group poorly equipped to withstand it. it feels awful but i made an investment in the property and i need to show prudence and conviction in how i manage it. 

on the side of ethics:

*by cleaning up the property, removing unsafe living conditions, excising dangerous criminal elements, bringing in competent management and my own financial resources to fund any crucial improvements, i'm making the entire community safer, healthier and better.* 

on the side of profits:

*i'm essentially performing a trailer park's version of gentrification, likely displacing at least some people who were already on the margins of society and now find themselves dumped outside even that. i've increased my investment's value and future cash flow, and, while i'm not responsible for the circumstances and choices that lead these tenants to this place in their lives, i am responsible for adding to their troubles in pursuit of personal gain.*

now, here's why i'm a bad person... i don't see this as any different from many of my own investments. for example, i own apple stock. i know for a fact that apple has used sweatshops and child labor in the past and likely still does to whatever extent they can get away with. i believe both sweatshops and child labor to be immoral, yet, i am willing to own shares in a company i know uses both because it yields a great return on my capital. it's not as in-my-face as having to tell a senior citizen they can't live in their home of 40 years anymore, but, at least in my opinion, it is not any less unethical. 

i've already accepted that my hands aren't clean. i still try to do good when i can and i volunteer in my community and donate to charity, but ultimately, i know when it comes to my investments, history proves i won't walk away from dirty money. i don't feel great about that but it's the truth.",2,,CurledUpNapping,0

1649155755,"while this is a fruit tweet, it's more like an onion.  it's got many layers, but be mindful on the short term.  hear me out.  

first layer -
take this tweet like every other poo emoji tweet.  fruit gives you the squirts, so expect some shit in the short term.  we will likely head a bit lower for a while.  not sure how long, could be a few weeks or a month or two.  whatever the timeframe, likely to see q reversal alone quarter ends, either before or right after.

second layer -
i think he's going to offload some of his apple stock.  i don't know how much, but expect it to be sizable.  i'm guessing he's going to redeploy in the next window, likely in june after the shareholder vote.

third layer - the most important one -
my thesis for the nft marketplace was not so much about art or even game items.  it was way bigger than that.  the real money was to go after the apple store revenue.  by being able to have revenue driving items throughout and nft marketplace, developers can subvert the 30% upcharge and share those revenues with gamestop.  apple made $85 billion in 2021.  if gme takes 10% of that, it more than doubles revenue.

1649166066,"i have a few thoughts and hopefully the following helps.   let me first note that i think i know what your source of confusion is, and it is a common confusion amongst students.  and i think it's the fault of the books and/or curriculum as much as anything, because there is a way we teach this that adds to the confusion.  also we use the term ""surface"" in two ways here commonly and it's confusing as hell.but i can definitely say that your original question is quite valid:  i thought the gradient is 2d, where the heck is some 3d vector coming from??

basically, the fundamental confusion here is that you're mixing two metaphors.  what i mean by this is when we visualize a function on \\r\^2, there are two visual metaphors that we can use:  we can think of the ""heatmap/contour-plot"" metaphor, or we can think of the ""3d graph"" metaphor.  these are related (the must be, since they come from the same underlying function) but they are just two different metaphors, and so it is good to keep the two separate in your head.  again, i think this can be the fault of courses/instructors since our instinct is to ""abuse notation"" and switch between the two.

ok, first, the heatmap/contour-plot picture.  the main idea here is that if i want to plot a function from \\r\^2 to \\r, i can think of it as values in the plane.  by heat map i mean this literally:  for example it is common to see a temperature map where one just color-codes different regions based on temperature.   one sees a similar thing in contour maps for elevation.  notice there is no graph here, and there is no ""z-direction"" here.  just colors, or numbers, on a plane.

take a specific example:  f(x,y) = x\^2 + 3y\^2.  ok, so if i color-coded the plane clearly i'd see blue near the origin, and then it would get redder as i moved out in each direction.  as a visual aid it would be useful to also plot the ""contours"", which are the level sets of the function.  in this case, these are the curves where x\^2+3y\^2 = c, which are of course ellipses centered on the origin.  so i could also plot a family of ellipses where i let c increase as i go out.

now, two questions:  let's say i'm at a particular point in the plane, and i want to know,

a\] in which direction should i move so that the function does not change at all?

b\] in which direction should i move so the function changes the most?

now, since these curves are places where the function is constant, it stands to reason that if i move in a direction \*\*tangent\*\* to these curves, my value should not change at all.  so i could move in one of two directions:  ""clockwise"" or ""anti clockwise"" along the ellipse, and the function should not change.  and one can show that locally this is true.

similarly, it stands to reason that the direction of largest increase is the direction perpendicular to this, so i should move perpendicular to the curve.  one direction will be largest increase, and the other will be largest decrease.in the case of $f(x,y) = x\^2 + 3y\^2$, at any point we get the gradient (2x,6y).  if you draw some pictures you can convince yourself that the vector pointing in the direction (2x,6y) \*\*based\*\* at (x,y) will be perpendicular to the level set.  the direction orthogonal to this,e.g. \\pm (6y,-2x) will be tangent to the curve.  so (2x,6y) should be the direction in which the function changes the most, and since it points ""out"", the function will be increasing the most in that direction.and in fact, this is what the gradient does.  it will always be \*\*orthogonal\*\* to the level set, and it will always point in the direction of largest increase.  now it might seem a bit magical that the zero increase and maximal increase directions are always orthogonal, but this is because the directional derivative is linear in the direction, and locally they are always orthogonal.

but, again, to summarize.  the gradient here is actually an honest-to-goodness 2d vector, and it lives in the plane, and it points in the direction of greatest color change, or, equivalently, it is orthogonal to the level set.

ok, so now restart with the metaphor, and think of the 3d graph.  back to $f(x,y) = x\^2 + 3y\^2$ ... here we know that the 3d graph is a ""paraboloid""... and this is a real 3d shape.  ok, what does the gradient have to do with this?  the gradient lives in \\r\^2.

ok, so now there is a 3d vector floating around, which we can define as follows.  let \\grad f be the gradient of f, and define the 3d vector where we append the length of \\grad f to \\grad f, i.e.

v = (df/dx, df/dy, (df/dx)\^2 + (df/dy)\^2)

what does this do? if i think about the 3d graph of the function, then the point (x,y,f(x,y)) lives in \\r\^3, and if i take the vector v and base it at this point, then this will be a 3d vector tangent to the surface that lives in 3d, and moreover it will point in the direction of greatest increase.  to see this, note that the projection of this vector into the plane should coincide with the gradient, and if we use the chain rule and ask how fast the z variable changes in the direction of \\grad f, it will be (after some algebra) \\grad f\\cdot \\grad f.

ok, so note... these are two different vectors, living in two different spaces, and meaning two different things.  but unfortunately all too often in calc 3 we confound these two things and this is a source of confusion.

also note that while the \\grad f vector is \*\*perpendicular\*\* to the level sets, the $v$ vector is \*\*tangent\*\* to the graph z=f(x,y).  another confusion here is when we refer to both the level sets and the graph as ""the surface"", in one case we are orthogonal, and in the other case tangent.  but, again, the level set is a curve (or 1d surface if you like) in the \\r\^2 plane, and the graph z=f(x,y) is a 2d surface inside \\r\^3.  very different!

[etfs are certainly heavily shorted (xrt for example is shorted something absurd like 700% right now), but consider also that the shares held institutionally are not super liquid. retail already has over 10 million shares direct-registered. millions more are locked up by insiders, state retirement funds, etc. the float isn't some impossibly high number of shares.   regardless of whether ""moass"" occurs though, i disagree that it's a shit stock. revenue is up a billion dollars since last year. sure eps takes a hit since they spent so much on inventory,  distribution warehouses, etc., but the business should be profitable by next year. even if the nft marketplace isn't innovative (i think it will be) and ends up being some kinda hated lootbox type bullshit... well,  games already print money on skins and shit like that, so even a lateral move seems foolproof. i can't imagine they'd have all these new first party partnerships and be able to pay seasoned execs mainly in stock equity if the company didn't have a bright future ahead on a value basis.  bagholder is a fine insult and i may be that, but qanon? no sir. i'm not waiting around for zombie kennedy to come save me.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tw4xfz/apes_vs_shorts/i3gkf2j/)

[i do understand the disagreement as we are using different assumptions for growth. i would think a p/e of 20-25 to be reasonable for a company selling 10m cars a year. because even if they can double, there is almost no room to grow after that ( they would just have the entire market ).  the total number of new cars sold yearly is about 18m.  there are some other income streams in energy, but that is again low margin &amp; p/e industry.  only when i see revenue growth percentage in the software sector i would think of adding more at this prices.  i still own the entire market so i want tsla to do good, but to expect similar returns from a company that went from 0 to 1m cars delivered vs 1m to 10m. i think is a bit optimistic.](/r/stocks/comments/tumycz/tesla_delivers_310048_electric_vehicles_in_the/i372bqq/)

[that doesn't work because there is a gap between guidance. if that was the case, the stock would only move at earning calls. but that doesn't work. people try to estimate performance in between when they buy or sell. if you bought tsla even today, it's because you estimate that they will sell y by the end of the year/next year/wtv period. there is no new guidance today, but you make a guesstimate based on guidance, how things are going, global events, etc. the analyst expectation is to represent that expectation, made with more data to predict than any single investor. and even those predictions vary wildly. that's why we look at an average of dozens of analysts. this gives us an idea of what the market expects, especially those with access to capital as analysts work for institutional or big investing firms.](/r/stocks/comments/tumycz/tesla_delivers_310048_electric_vehicles_in_the/i35vsvz/)

[the well-established literature on this finds that the expected return maximizing choice are globally diversified, low cost index funds like vtsax + vtiax. buying up the most 'aggressive' etfs often comes to mean, ""buy the most overpriced etfs"" (arkk). i think you can't do much better than 100% vtsax and vtiax. you say you are generally bullish on tech, but so is the entire market, elevating their valuations.  if you want to be aggressive in your investments in a way that actually increases your expected returns, overweight small cap value stocks. (see avuv for example) prioritize what the market severely undervalues to increase your expected returns, effectively.  if you want a summary of the literature, i must point you to ben felix:  video 1: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mvssvi1_e4)  certainly there is a decent chance those mega-cap stocks will do well, and i personally do not mind overweighting some picks like msft/aapl in my portfolio. but this is at odds at what is supposed to be optimal.

5. it's useless for purchasing non-trivial items such as bread and gas, because of the exorbitantly high transaction fees. 

6. it's volatility makes it useless as a store of value. 

7. people will inevitably default to using a centralized authority such as binance of coinbase in order manage their ""private"" keys and make withdrawals easier. this defeats the purpose of decentralization.

8. it's value is derived from its scarcity; however, this scarcity makes bitcoin a deflationary asset whose only utility is rewarding early adopters as the value of their coins increase as more people buy coins. 

9. yes, this isn't dissimilar from other asset classs: however, when you purchase a bond, there's a central authority that can guarantee its minimum value. when you purchase equities, you purchase a company's balance sheet, human capital, and current product line of goods and services among other things. if everyone stopped buying apple stock and there were 100 million shares outstanding, you wouldn't be able to purchase apple's entire value chain for $100 million. that would be fraud, whereas if everyone stopped buying bitcoin, people would move on with their lives. the only present utility of shareholding bitcoin is to liquidate the positions of early adopters.

1649180143,"personally, i'm of the belief that dividend focused investing is the end game, not the game plan to get there. while accumulating, total return is the most important thing (well, after avoiding permanent loss of capital). the more wealth you accrue, the more you can divert your focus from total returns to things like cash flow and stability. 

having said all that, if you want to stick to dividend strategies (which is fine btw!), i see little reason not to just ride $schd from start to finish. it's a strong mix of growth, diversification and yield. if you're interested in throwing in a few picks like $msft and $aapl feel free, but if you're going to take the time to learn how to properly evaluate and price dividend stocks, you would likely do better just investing all your capital into outstanding, dividend paying companies at reasonable entry points. a major reason people prefer to rely on etfs like $schd is because they don't want to have to worry about doing all that. if you're going to learn the skill anyway, you might as well fully leverage it. if you're not going to learn it, maybe just stick to the dividend etfs.

likewise, the covered call etfs in phase 3 are more for people who are trying to retire on a relatively small amount of money and only care about income, not capital appreciation. if phase 1/2 go well, you should hopefully have enough to just retire as is without having to sacrifice returns for yield via covered call etfs. all the funds you listed underperform vs the market and their only real benefit is their cash flow. 

basically, if you're going to move forward into your proposed phase 2, just make it phase 1, 2 and 3. if you're happy with $schd, just make it your core holding and ride it into the retirement sunset. all this is just my opinion, not saying its objectively the best strategy.",3,,CurledUpNapping,0

&gt; sure, but they obviously have enough money/stuff or they would sell the assets.

*they do*. this is the point. there's not some cohort of ultra wealthy running around borrowing for all their spending. almost no one actually follows through on the full ""buy, borrow, die"" strategy without paying any taxes themselves (while alive).

&gt; i thought the point of the loan was to plan when you sell the assets to get the most cash and pay the least taxes

exactly, it's to time when you want to sell assets. that's exactly what a loan does. it's not some magical instrument that creates wealth or avoids taxes. anyone with a brokerage account can borrow money against their assets. for the last couple years rates were pretty cheap and the market was doing well (for most of the time) so it was a pretty ok deal. but there's a good reason everyone doesn't do this, if the market goes the other way you can be forced to sell at the worst time. history has tons of examples of rich people borrowing against their assets and then going bankrupt when the market turned against them.  it's risky and it costs money, so it's only used occasionally and/or for a small percentage of your total wealth.

&gt; i don't get pay taxes every five to ten years.

lots of people don't pay any taxes every year (at least not income or capital gains taxes) there's a whole (older) part of the population that is living off of saved assets and often generate low or zero tax burden every year. 

but more importantly, the whole point of borrowing, spending and then selling to pay back the loans is to pay *more* taxes. if i borrow against my microsoft stock for 2% a year in interest cost, and the stock goes up 20% a year for 3 years and then i sell, i end up paying *much more* in taxes. i don't see how that's a bad thing? paying a ton of taxes in one year isn't way better than paying a little bit of taxes every year.

&gt; nor do my ""assets"", like my car, go up in value over the mid term like their stocks, etc, might

yes, if you can't afford to invest, then you're getting screwed. this is a very real problem in the us because the cost of living is going up and incomes aren't keeping pace. but whether other people can afford to take out loans or not has zero impact on whether you can save enough to invest. the problem is random rich assholes, it's the particular rich asshole that owns whatever company you're working for.

that particular rich asshole probably loves the fact that you're complaining about loans, a problem which isn't really a problem and is also basically impossible to fix. it's a boogeyman for politicians to scare you with that they know they'll never be able to fix.

if you want to get angry about our tax laws, we can look at the top marginal tax rate over time, or the inheritance tax laws or we can talk about making real change and talk about passing a wealth tax. all those things would have a real impact on us tax revenues and make some dent in wealth inequality. trying to ban *borrowing money* would be a gigantic mess.",0,,PM_ME_UR_Definitions,0

roth is using post-tax dollars, so compared to the ira, your investment is already 20% less (and will compound less), but when you take it out, you will not pay tax on the money you take out.

1649281091,"lottos are just more efficient for apple use because of all you get out of it. it doesn't mean you have to save all your apples for them, or never use them outside of lottos!

use apples for whatever reason they want - it's a single player game after all. you might want to use apples to clear out an event shop, for example (as you typically need apples to do this). there are also non-lotto events that are good to use apples on, like raids (apocrypha was a good example of this) or things like the las vegas event for qp. sometimes, you might just want to apple because you need resources pronto for some reason. and sure, maybe that's not as efficient - but it's what you need! no crime in that, in my honest opinion.

i also think that the ""apples only for lotto"" logic doesn't apply to all players. newbies, for example, might find they want to apple so they can raise some servants quickly. and even experienced players don't use up all their apples on lotto - i, for example, have never drained my apple stock in any event because that would require wayyyy too much farming for me. i've found a nice limit, that usually means i have apples remaining, and that's fine. contrary to some stuff i've heard about people using every apple on lottos, i never find the need to do that.

1649281422,"gold silver and copper is always a safe bet.

copper is used in virtually any generator i know of. generators are really good, some might say are the vital components for everything with generating electricity. 

silver is possible to be without when it comes to electric cars, however, my limited knowledge states that it's way easier, if just a bit more expensive, for every car made.

gold is the goat. always have been, always will be. it won't make you rich, but it will make you stay that way, while some people say it's hard to move, i agree, but it's still the most liquid asset in the world, finding a buyer is easy as finding shit on your windscreen.


nothing that will make you rich, it's main drawback is the opportunity cost. if you have all your money in gold, it won't work for you the same way nvidia stock will, however, if you don't know what to invest in, you shouldn't invest in anything yet, so the opportunity cost isn't really a drawback for you.",-1,,Neijo,0

1649282246,"i started taking an interest in stocks and crypto in 2017 and then around 2019 i started to undestand that finances and investing are an essential part of life.

one of the first memorable moments in the stock market for me was when nvidia stock dipped because the crypto market tanked and all sorts of gpu's hit the second hand market competing with nvidia's sales and disrupting supply chain. i thought ""oh cool, this will certainly stabilize and rebound""

fastforward a couple years and i start dcaing into a dividend portfolio where i really get into investing in a serious way, super easy and rewarding. that leads into learning more about tech, growth, and crypto.

i remember at the time hearing all about gme on the news, i was driving uber at the time and all of my passengers would talk about gme. i took that as a case of ""when the shoeshine is giving stock tips it's time to sell"" funny how the roles reverse when it's driving young college students around campus/downtown. i think dogecoin was really popular at that time as well.

i looked at it purely as trading, something i would have to keep a hawk eye on in order to sell at just the right time which wasn't really something that interested me.

fast forward to now and i guess it's been about a year or two since the ath and it appears the same conditions exist as did during the original squeeze. hedgefunds doubleing down with borrowing, lending, and all their balance sheet tricks. i decided to get involved and started buying some shares over the past few months and learning about computershare.

i have a reasonable position that if i lose it it will sting a bit but it won't be the end of my life. it probably is fomo but i'll call it ""fomo with style""  - it really does feel like a movement against banking and wall street. i don't claim to know what the outcome will be, in fact i have no idea, it seems like this will be an unprecedented event and i think that's part of the thrill of it. i know this is meltdown but i'm pretty middle ground on gme.

lately with all the the geo-political turmoil i've been learning a lot more about the global economy, foreign trade, and commodities. one of my biggest fears is not a melt down in the sense of a gme meltdown but a global financial meltdown with food and energy shortages. in my mind that's a real melt down and i'm sort of impressed by how much has stayed ""normal as usual"" in the face of the coming consequences.",6,,Civil-Still2542,0

right, but your comment was in response to my pondering of the acronym, which has absolutely nothing to do with pay. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp


&gt; in finance, “faang” is an acronym that refers to the stocks of five prominent american technology companies: meta (fb) (formerly known as facebook), amazon (amzn), apple (aapl), netflix (nflx); and alphabet (goog) (formerly known as google). 

&gt;the term was popularized by jim cramer, the television host of cnbc's mad money, in 2013, who praised these companies for being “totally dominant in their markets."" originally, the term ""fang"" was used, with apple—the second “a” in the acronym—added in 2017. 

it's just weird to me to claim microsoft stock has not been ""totally dominant in their market"" especially with it being included in big tech.

honestly, it just sounds like some trendy bullshit acronym that stuck because it sounds cool more than truly being anything meaningful. hence the discussion around changing it due to company renaming, updating it due to meta's fall from ""domination"" and so on.

ahh well, i guess at this point it's taken on a life of it's own, i just think it's silly and over used and something i've always pondered how it came to any prominence or importance, whether a mixture of exposure, viralness or whatever, i don't find much use in it.",2,,imisstheyoop,0
1649364536,"the ""gift"" in canada would be with money already taxed as income. you can't give someone something with unrealized capital gains, for example - i.e. ""here's the apple stock i bought when it was $10.""  if you do that, it's deemed to have been sold for fair market value and taxes are due. but if i take money out of my pocket (or bank account) that i've already paid income taxes on, what difference does it make if i give it to the porsche dealer or my nephew? 

canada iirc has no inheritance tax on the total value of the estate. however, all assets in the estate are deemed the equivalent of sold and the deceased income tax is due (i.e. on capital gains outstanding for anything) before being passed on to heirs.  (except primary dwelling to spouse, and assorted exemptions on family businesses and farms are exempt). 

so basically, you can put off income on unrealized capital gains by not selling them, but eventually you either sell them or your estate sells or does not but pays taxes on the market price difference.  

(as i understand, the usa is different in that estate assets are re-based to the current market price on inheritance, with no capital gains due. almost like that rule was written by a bunch of multi-millionaires...)

so if you have money in the bank to spend on frivolities like food, lodging, and a gift for your nephew, you have already paid tax on that money. no more tax is due.",1,,nightwing2000,0

1649373007,"thank you for publishing the references.  there are many on reddit that are confusing the procedures for cash dividends with those of a large stock dividend or stock split.  one common  point of confusion is how stock dividends are handled for borrowed shares.   borrowers must, on the dividend payment date, pay the lender a cash-in-lieu payment as a substitute for a cash dividend.

there have been many posts that assume that a stock dividend means that borrowers will have to go into the market and buy shares to make an immediate stock dividend to the stock lender on the dividend payment date.   this is not true for a large stock dividend.

the only part of your post i disagree with is ""large stock dividends are quite rare ….  ""
        tesla 3 for 1 split was really a 2 share stock dividend.  the nvidia stock split was really a stock dividend.  the planned alphabet/google 20 for 1 split will be in the form of a 19 share stock dividend.   large stock dividends are actually more common than small stock dividends.

edit to add:  another correction.  a 10% stock dividend would be equivalent to a 11 for 10 split or a 1.1 split ratio.   the 0.1 split ratio you have in your table is the split ratio for a reverse split of 10 shares into 1.    per my understanding, a 10% stock dividend would be more likely to trigger a short squeeze as it might force short sellers to go out and close 10% of their position (or maybe 9.09% of their position) to pay to the lender as a stock dividend.   or they might be able to make a cash-in-lieu payment …. i am not sure.

and a 3 to 1 split is accomplished by a 2 share or 200% dividend, not a 300% dividend.   similarly, a 7 to 1 split is accomplished by a 6 share dividend or 600% dividend, not a 700% dividend.",2,,HiReturns,0

[it means apple is at less of a premium based on current growth. anything over peg=1 has accelerating future growth priced in though. you'd pay more or less of a premium depending on how much you expect growth to speed up over the coming years. personally i'd be wary of the expectations built into some stocks right now as they're still reflecting growth rates during a time of historically low interest rates on loans. that era is ending the same time energy price is spiking and i'd expect growth to slow, not speed up this year and perhaps into next year.  if you're buying for retirement or like a 10 yr time horizon this information is less useful and i'd lean toward just buying stocks with high pricing power and competitive advantage. both aapl and nvda fit that bill.](/r/stocks/comments/tyznuj/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/i3worys/)

[this amd downgrade is bullshit. let me repost a very compelling counter posted on a sa comment section (yes, not a very credibly source, but i think it tears apart the analysts):  &gt; read the statements and previous earning calls and commentary by tsm, asml, gfs and others. every fab is booked solid for the next two years. in the past (before the pandemic) just-in-time ordering was the rage. analysts are used to this. also used to assuming companies will cut orders at the slightest whiff of reduced demand. many customers were burned badly because of this assumption that they could just order again and supply would be met just in time. now it’s “just in case” where higher inventory is desired regardless of fluctuations in end customer demand. in addition, due to long standing backlogs, fab throughput is not as flexible to schedule changes they used to be.  &gt; we already know there will be some weakness in smart phones (see tsm commentary, apple reducing se orders). but for some reason apple and big tech is hanging in there. we also know there will be sizeable inventory build from autos and other industrials - that is if they don’t want to forsake billions in sales again for lack of a tiny chip that will barely take up warehouse space and won’t go obsolete for years. they got burned badly last time and are still supply constrained by the fabs - and their cars and trucks are rusting in snow covered parking lots. not a great situation they’d be anxious to repeat.  &gt; we also know ev demand will only increase because of high gas prices. and we know customers who buy evs are not at the low end who restrict purchases to save when rates go up. evs and smart cars and self-driving take a lot of chips and data processing. a helluva a lot. and most companies will not want to cancel their orders. most likely the companies reducing orders are for the low end - eg android in china ie mediatek for example, where they already have inventory from the past to make up for forecasting errors or sudden demand spurts.  &gt; i don’t think fb, amzn, googl or msft will be meaningfully decelerating their cloud and data center businesses - where the most profitable segments for the chips are - servers, ml, ai. i also don’t think the metaverse research and development is all dead. we will be moving to a much more graphically intensive internet one way or another. solid state devices will keep supplanting hard disk drives. these trends will continue. nvda is pioneering new industries like virtualization of factories and prototyping. everything is very silicon intensive.  &gt; in addition carriers are just now ramping 5g. i also don’t think vz and att and tmus will delay 5g rollout simply because of an economic slowdown and stop ordering the reqd semis. iot is also becoming more pervasive and everything with a led in it or anything that plugs in uses semis that used to cost a few pennys a few years back, but now cost dimes or dollars due to limited supply capacity. the recession, even if it hits, will not suddenly kill peoples desire for semis and electronics, and esp for gaming when consoles are still in short supply, and games more realistic than ever.    can't post the link for the rest.](/r/stocks/comments/tyznuj/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/i3xm1yo/)

edit: a great example was with aapl stock last year in 2021. after one of their earnings, the stock fell to the low 140s, high 130s and this analyst (christine was her name i believe) came on saying “oh it’s overvalued you should sell”. later in the year, it hit 174 and the same analyst, i shit you not, said to buy the stock. the stock then immediately went down to 150 in early 2022",2,,TarCress,0

if you knew apple was going to be successful, but didn't know when the stock exploded, you could be sitting on apple stock for like 10 years and look like an idiot when it drops in value after the apple 2.

let me tell you a little story. in early 2020 this thing called covid and nearly everything in society throughout the world closed down. this should have been the most deflationary event in human history. had it been left to market forces your home value would have gone down massively. 

luckily for you and other home owners the central bankers came in and printed trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars while bringing the interest rates down to essentially zero. 

these government and central bank policies resulted in massive inflation, particularly with home prices. it directly resulted in an even greater wealth gap. 

&gt;i don't care about 2019 values over 2022 values. 

yeah well maybe you should care....if you're a decent person. this wasn't you buying apple stock before steve jobs took back over. this wasn't you buying bitcoin when it was under 10 dollars because you believed in its future. you aren't some kind of brilliant investor here. you bought a home, as many people do, and then the central bankers printed money night and day directly increasing your paper wealth. you didn't do anything....it was only the people who control interest rates. 

so i ask you....why was it ok for them to do that for you but it's not ok for somebody to reverse this and bring housing prices back to what is reasonable? to where things were before they broke the economy? that's very selfish of you. 

it's especially shocking how you invoked working class people, mentioned your teaching profession and even immigrants as if there aren't millions of such teachers, immigrants and working class people out there who haven't purchased a home yet and are on the flip side of this mess. 

&gt;move to wichita. or louisville. or some place that's nice and affordable.

thankfully i don't have to move anywhere because i have done well in life and am in a comfortable place financially. but unlike you i care about my fellow man who didn't benefit as we have these past few years from fed policy.

shit like elon buying 10% of twitter is unlikely to have the same effect as if elon bought up all the housing in your nearest city. the former would possibly mean changes for the platform while the latter would massively reduce the supply of housing without doing anything to curb demand, causing an increase in housing prices.

few years later the dot com crash happens and smart me decides the stock market is a scam and proceeds to sell everything and close my etrade account. i shudder to think what that’d be worth today. (it would have had an effective price of 14 cents when i bought, now it’s $170)",5,,wanderingstan,0

1649699144,"if you have excel 365 you can use filter().  if you don't have excel 365 but you are using windows, you can use powerquery.

here's how to use filter():

=filter(column d, (column g = specific job number) * (column v = specific job title))

this will generate an array of names that are assigned to that job number and have the specific job title.  there may be duplicates.  that's why we then will wrap it all up with unique():

=unique(filter(...))

and lastly to count it up, we will wrap that with counta().  final formula:

=counta(unique(filter(column d, (column g = job number)*(column v = job title))))

here's a specific example that counts how many professional arm wrestlers are assigned to job # 80085:

=counta(unique(filter($d$2:$d$50,($g$2:$g$50=80085)*($v$2:$v$50=""professional arm wrestler""))))",1,,lolcrunchy,0

in anti-trust laws' defense, they're intended to be.  
  
the thing you need to remember when you're reading headlines that say ""policy x could have effect y"" is that our elected officials are familiar with the concept of nuance and degrees.  it's like when folks say that raising taxes will cause them to go bankrupt, and then you find out that they're talking about something absurd like a 99.2% top marginal tax rate... that literally has zero chance of becoming law.  
  
what i'm saying is that our law makers are capable of threading the needle, we can pass anti-trust legislation *without* destroying whole industries in the process *just like* we can raise taxes without destroying the whole economy.  
  
the absolute most extreme scenario for anti-trust legislation *could* hurt iphone users, which is exactly why *nobody is proposing the absolute most extreme scenario for anti-trust legislation.*

^(except for news corp, which should be trust-busted back into the stone age.)

cook is saying this because he has to say it, he has to defend his business against anything that would diminish it, that's what his board of directors pays him to do.  but for us, the voters and iphone users down in the trenches, i really don't think there's much to worry about.  if we pass anti-trust legislation your apple stock may take a hit, but your iphone will still work just fine.",1,,MaximumEffort433,0

so once i was making real money i dedicated a decade to just $$$, depriving myself in other ways and reinvesting aggressively into my business, which had a high profit margin.  every time i had an extra $20,000 i didn't need i'd wait for apple stock to sell off then buy more.  i even borrowed $500,000+ on margin for a short time and bought apple the day steve jobs died since i figured he had terminal cancer for two years so wasn't running the company anyway, and i was right.  a lot of this is luck and timing, but in general if you accumulate a quality investments over a long period of time it will grow and grow.  my saving grace was that i chose apple, but your invetsment choices will differ.

i am also naturally thrifty.  i was very healthy so i risked it and went without health insurance for a decade.  i bought second hand and at discount stores.  i got my medical and dental care when i traveled to latin america. i avoided high maintenance women but found a good girlfriend i could afford and stayed single with no kids, and oh yeah i also eventually inherited 1 million, and i bought a condo 30 years ago in a prime section of la so that appreciated about $700,000 before i finally sold.",0,,Immediate-Assist-598,0

the problem with that idea is the r&amp;d actually was tangible and that cost wasn't sunk as much as it was invested. you can't just say ""i'm gonna stop this f-35 waste of money and make an f-36 that will be better"" like you can say ""i'm going to sell tesla and buy apple stock""

1649822566,"&gt;still russia has about 400 modern tanks (t-90s) and about 2,500 slightly older models (t-72/80s). with reserves it's over 10k but that would be a lot of losses from those javelins.

the t-80 is more modern than the t-90, but it cost too much and used a gas turbine instead of diesel. and we all know russia's fuel issues. the t-90 is a redesignated t-72 with some of the t-80's tech. i mean it's literally the same exact tank as a t-72 with an extra layer of modernized equipment. the us destroyed so many t-72's in iraq that russia changed it to the t-90 to remove that stigma in the export market.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-90)

&gt;the t-90 has its origins in a soviet-era program aimed at developing a single replacement for the t-64, t-72 and t-80 series of main battle tanks. **the t-72 platform was selected as the basis** for the new generation of tank owing to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and automotive qualities. the kartsev-venediktov design bureau from nizhny tagil was responsible for the design work and prepared two parallel proposals—**the object 188, which was a relatively simple upgrade of the existing t-72b tank (object 184)...**  
&gt;  
&gt;the object 188 was engineered by a team under v.n. venediktov. the biggest change was the integration of the 1a45 fire-control system of the t-80u. **the object 188 was initially designated as the t-72bm.**  
&gt;  
&gt;the principal upgrade in the t-90 is the incorporation of a slightly modified form of the t-80u's more sophisticated 1a45t irtysh fire control system and an upgraded v-84ms multi-fuel engine developing 830 hp (620 kw).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-80)

&gt;the t-80 performed so poorly in the first chechen war that general-lieutenant aleksandr galkin, the head of the armour directorate, convinced the minister of defence after the conflict **to never again procure tanks with gas turbine engines** \[37\] (galkin reversed his position in 1996, **claiming that the t-80u was superior to the t-90**).",3,,DrJohanzaKafuhu,0

however, i am wondering whether we can say the same about the embedded curve. can one find an automorphism of $\mathbb{c}\^2 \setminus o$ that sends $c \setminus o$ to some line, say $v(x) \setminus o$?

edit: i realized that the curve complements are not isomorphic. the fundamental group of the complement of a line is free of one generator, whereas the curve complement of $c$ is $\langle a, b \mid a\^2 = b\^3 \rangle$. interestingly enough, the $h\^1$ do coincide.",1,,edelopo,0

""the point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.  each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for god loves a cheerful giver.  and god is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.""

sorry if you're not receptive to the perspective i try to share.

while i think (and know) scams exist, i do not think all parts of the blockchain space are scams, at all. there are many legitimate projects.

it's more like the wild west -- if you know how to protect yourself, you can have good life on a small homestead. it's still hard work, but there is a playbook. and if you go looking for trouble in the wild west, you'll quickly find it. 

in blockchain circles, trouble doesn't go out of its way to find you. you go out of your way to find it and fail in the depth of your own due diligence and operational practices. unbridled optimism is dangerous. and in that this respect, the blockchain space is not dissimilar to any other path for investments.

with any field, if you think someone is unable to remain objective after making their disclosures, you're going to limit yourself from experts and insights you don't personally have access to. 

e.x. i'd gladly listen to an engineer at apple share wit me about battery chemistry. i'd even be glad to talk with their marketing team, since they may be able to translate the engineer into layman's terms for me better. and i've done that -- it's an education.

that the engineer or marketing department may own apple stock, that does not inherently invalidate their opinion. it just means you need to look at the totality of their motivations, how things are presented, and then make an informed assessment.

so it's up to you wether to met my comments with foolhardy blind trust (i never suggest that), informed skepticism, or knee jerk dismissal. i've not no horse in that race either.

but were it me, i think a healthy, informed skepticism is rarely a bad default. to do otherwise limits your input to an echo chamber of confirmation and survival bias.",1,,Glimmer_III,0

maybe if the news had a bigger impact on more customers (not just a few hundred big ones) it would make financial news but at this point it seems unlikely and it will just be discussed on tech sites. example the article linked below is the top article and widely discussed on hacker news but i think cnbc and bloomberg have better things to review. if this did get to cnbc perhaps the stock would go down but probably not 20% anymore (unless i get lucky - lol).

right now i'm hoping $msft goes up another 2% tomorrow cause then i'll have a quick 500% return from otm call options i bought 2 days ago when all tech stocks were down. i bought some $spy calls today that expire tomorrow to so just hoping the market goes up right now. as an offset i bought a smaller number of $spy puts in case market goes down (worst would be sideways all day then everything gets fucked).

i did that last friday 1 $spy put for every 2 or 3 calls and the put lost all money but i sold the calls for several hundred percent gain.

even though i feel $team is overvalued a lot of people don't and due to it's volatility leaps (even atm weeklies) are very expensive so i generally have more success with spy or larger more well known companies.

still though after seeing what happened to $okta about 3 weeks ago i want in on some of these tech company short term collapses. only need to good trade that returns 2000%+ trade to offset many bad ones. i know check hacker news daily looking for potential trouble before it reaches the stock market lol. basically $okta was discussed there days ahead of time before the financial news sites reported on the hack.

we have a progressive tax system. your income is taxed in bucket increments all from $1 to $628,000. 

if you look at total taxes paid / total annual income = your effective tax rate. 

for example, a single person that makes 100k a year (in say nevada, no state or local income tax) would owe the us government about $15k for an effective tax rate of 15%. however if you only looked at 100k income on the irs tax tables (https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040tt), you'd see 18%. but you don't actually pay 18% on all your income.

false. if i lost $100k for all of my investments this year, i will get to carry that forward at $3000 increments only. 

if i lost 100k in stock and made $200k in real estate in the same year, they don't wash. the income/loss has to be ""in kind"".

1649934216,"&gt;the soviet premise is wrong, the soviet union merely co opted the name, they were in charge and did more than ""let them do their own thing"" at least by definitional standards.

false. when soviet troops entered pyongyang on 24 august 1945, they found a local people's committee established there, led by veteran christian nationalist cho man-sik. unlike their american counterparts, the soviet authorities recognized and worked with the people's committees.

this according to: robinson, michael e (2007). korea's twentieth-century odyssey, pages 105-107 and cumings, bruce (2005). korea's place in the sun: a modern history. pg. 227-228.


&gt;he was a prk leader when the soviets entered, but the soviets didn't like didnt like him or his party leanings so they installed a former korean who fought with the soviets. 

i mean this isn't really true. since cho-man sik was initially favoured by the ussr when they first entered. but also, you're now discussing the dprk and its leadership.

&gt;so its tough to claim the soviets occupied the north ""but let them do their own thing.""

it really isn't. because that is exactly what they did. the furtre of the prk changed when it was dissolved by the americans in the south. so it's only natural that there were changes in leadership. but the structure of the government, the people's councils, stayed in tact and were incorporated into the future dprk.

&gt;see, i can make absurdly pointless comments too.

the ""too"" there implies i said anything absured or pointless. let me repeat myself, if the usa didn't occupy southern korea and then dissolve the popular prk, there wouldn't be a war. because there'd be a unified korea. 
not dissolving the prk is a good thing, isn't the thing i thought you'd take issue with tbh.

&gt;im not aware of any credible academic at all who puts the korean war on one certain thing, especially on the usa.

then maybe it's time that they started to do that. again, the root cause of the conflict came from the usa dissolving the prk because it was socialist. 
there would not be much of a division of korea had this not happened, especially since the soviets were very hands off while the prk.

&gt;syngman rhee was not peacefully inclined, but the dprk ultimately started the korean war we got. 

maybe then, rhee should not have occupied and bombed the city of haeju. the korean attack on the south on 25 june 1950 was a response to a two-day long bombing by the south koreans and their surprise attacks on haeju and other places. early in the morning of 25 june, before the dawn counterattack in the north korean account, the south korean office of public information announced that the southern forces had captured haeju

&gt;tens of millions of south koreans flourishing in their society are certainly happy they were not unified into the bleak, tyrannical, and somewhat theocratic eerie regime of north korea.


""flourishing""

all i'm saying is, if birth rates are projected to become negative in the near future because life and debt are so expensive that having children is a joke of an idea, maybe that's not flourishing.

&gt;you are allowing a certain occasion where the u.s killed south korean civilians, and now saying that we can put the hundreds of thousands of deaths of south koreans citizens on the u.s?

yes.

i used no-gun ri as an example, of one event where the south korean casualties could be pinned on the usa. another example is bodo league, where the usa supported and was complicit, if not outright involved, the execution of up to 200,000 people. 

&gt;i was being generous in my earlier comment by saying that 1.5 million north korean civilians died

this is why i think yankee liberals are nothing less than ghouls...

https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/new-evidence-north-korean-war-losses#:~:text=washington%2c%20d.c.%20%2d%20a%20north%20korean,korean%20war%20of%201950%2d53.#

the newly discovered census figures add important information to russian reports on the war recently published by south korea's ministry of national defense. according to chosun ilbo (seoul, 25 june 2001), four volumes of reports by soviet ambassador and chief military adviser to the dprk, lt.-gen. v.n.razuvaev, compiled by the ministry's institute of military history, cite a total of 1.2 million civilian casualties for north korea, which include 282,000 killed in bombing raids and 796,000 fled to the south or missing. **the remaining 800,000 population loss therefore represents the total deaths from combat and natural causes.**
so at the very least that is 1.1 million deaths, since it refers tto deaths from combat and natural causes. not just injury, which goes unmentioned in this report.

furthermore, according to guenter  lewy in ""america in vietnam"". pp. 450–453: ""estimates of communist troops killed are about one-half million. the total number of korean civilians who died in the fighting, which left almost every major city in north and south korea in ruins, has been estimated at between 2 and 3 million.""

this is to say nothing of how in 2018 after the release of a suppressed isc (international scientific commission) report, and the release of declassified cia communications daily reports in 2020, it was revealed that the us used [germ warfare](https://jeff-kaye.medium.com/a-real-flood-of-bacteria-and-germs-communications-intelligence-and-charges-of-u-s-4decafdc762) in the korean war. [many of these attacks involved the dropping of insects or small mammals infected with viruses such as anthrax, plague, cholera, and encephalitis.](https://jeff-kaye.medium.com/a-concealed-war-crime-u-s-anthrax-bombings-of-china-during-the-korean-war-14782ceb40a9).


&gt;""senior indonesian officials have taken part in an unprecedented meeting to discuss the killing of 500,000 communists and their supporters during an insurgency 50 years ago.""

this is a very stupid piece of evidence. in the same vein as ""i investigated myself and found i did nothing wrong.""

whereas other sources, such as: https://www.routledge.com/the-army-and-the-indonesian-genocide-mechanics-of-mass-murder/melvin/p/book/9781138574694

say things like: ""for the past half century, the indonesian military has depicted the 1965-66 killings, which resulted in the murder of approximately one million unarmed civilians, as the outcome of a spontaneous uprising. this formulation not only denied military agency behind the killings, it also denied that the killings could ever be understood as a centralised, nation-wide campaign.""

&gt;regarding the russian famine. 

what??? where in that reply did i say anything about the famine??? why are you back-pedalling back to this???

&gt;led by joseph stalin, the soviet union wanted to punish germany economically, forcing the country to pay war reparations and contribute its industrial technology to help postwar soviet recovery. 

it would have been easier for you to just link the article you copy-pasted this from. 

at any rate, your argument is kinda undermined by:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalin_note

furthermore, none of this changes the fact that the usa still violated pretty much every agreement made with the ussr on germany. they created a new currency, they combined all other occupation zones into one and a new economic zone with it. among other things &gt;_&gt;

had the us abided by these agreements, perhaps the whole blockade and airlift could have been avoided. given that there had already been news of an ""operation unthinkable"" in the ussr, that they would see an attempt to unify germany under squarely western influence as a precursor to an attack.

1649962194,"ok, here's my conundrum.

approx $400k in apple stock and other individual company stocks currently in an account for my late husband's estate.    needs to go half to my name, half to 20 year old daughter.

there's a bunch of small holdings that i don't want to keep.    more so, my 20 year old shouldn't have all her money in individual stocks.    

ideally, we want to sell almost all of her share of it plus much of my share.    

question!   do i (as executor) sell it inside the estate account?   or should i transfer it ""in kind"" to our own brokerage accounts and then sell it?

cap gains is definitely in play, he died during the early covid stock plummet, so our basis price is low for everything.

i want to minimize taxes and also maximize aca subsidy (we were subsidized to about $850 a month in 2021).

i want someone to tell me how it will pan out.    whether to sell in the estate or outside of it (either way, it's ""our money"").  

one idea i have is to sell all of it (except keep some apple) in 2022 and thus take the full cap gains hit up front and get no aca subsidy for 2022, then go back to having little taxable income in 2023.    good idea?    i'm not certain.

any points in the right direction are welcome.   i am so disappointed that the guy who used to do my taxes just ignored my contact.    i feel like he would have been able to understand my situation and advise.",1,,Starbuck522,0

patience is so very important.  easier said than done though.  like yourself, i sold $aapl too early.  but, i did catch $amzn fairly early…loaded $amzn in the $300’s, then added in the $900’s ...about 1/3 of the way to 7 figures.

it's very simple, i refuse to buy apple stock, but i do buy apple products.  


&gt;i know all large corporations only care about profit, but most seem to do it without causing issues for their clients or customers. 

not really, it's more that the others are less newsworthy. i'll give you an example that illustrates this. greenpeace once launched a huge campaign bringing down apple for the same lack of green-ness that apples sharde with the entire industry. why against apple? because that is newsworthy, whereas going after hp would have been a waste of effort. and here's the catch, the very next year, they awarded apple a prize for being the greeness of those same un-green companies. they actually went after the best ...

apple is horrible in many ways and exemplary in others. the very attitude that helps them make great products also helps them be totally horrible in other aspects. get over this, companies stink. however, apple is the only company in this industry that is design-driven, the rest are feature-driven. i go for apple products because i love the end result of a design-driven process, not because i like the company and the way they do business.

1650037394,"compensatory damages are there to make the injured party whole.  this includes lost wages and benefits, opportunity costs, damage to reputation, pain and suffering, legal fees, loss of wages while pursuing the lawsuit, and so on.  i can see 1.5m for that for a highly compensated technical job.

punitive damages are there to deter similar behavior by the offending party and others,  they are supposed to be high, so [the next time mcdonald's executives run the numbers](https://www.enjuris.com/blog/resources/mcdonalds-hot-coffee-lawsuit/) and determine that:

* we will make a $v cents more in profit per $w cups sold by keeping the coffee at flesh-meltingly high temperatures so we don't have to brew it as often
* we expect x number of people will have their genitals melted per year at an average settlement cost of $y, so total additional cost of selling a product we know to be unconscionably hazardous to our customers is x \* $y per year
* so the expected increase in profit will be $v \* $w - x \* $y = $z/year.  if $z is a positive number, we will do it.  more profit is good.
* shame about those melted genitals, but hey, cost of doing business.  also, not my genitals, not my problem.

... those executives will have to factor in possible punitive damage awards and think twice.

and this, of course, is why big business pushed for ""tort reform"" and statutory limits on punitive damages, so they can have a firm upper limit in settlement costs so they can run the numbers and, when the numbers say more profit at the cost of a few melted genitals per year -- capped punitive damages factored in, make data-driven decisions that maim and kill people.

personally, i don't think there should be any upper limit on punitive damages.  if the jury and the judge and the appeals court are so outraged at a business for what they allowed to happen to a person that they award a number calculated to bankrupt that business and every executive employed there, well, then perhaps other businesses will take that in to account in the future.",-2,,deetar,0

1650051591,"short selling does a few things - broadly, it allows for the preservation of capital during downturns in the market for a security or the market overall. 

as a related concept, it allows for the mitigation of risk, which allows for more investment. 

example: if i own 100 shares of apple, i might say that i would like to maintain my long position, but would also like to generate some income in the short term without selling shares. thanks to options, i can sell a call option above the current share price for a small commission, which i get to keep - if the stock rises higher, i must either purchase another call option to retain my shares, or sell at this higher price. 

this exists because there is a buyer on the other end who would be willing to buy apple stock at a higher price, but isn’t interested in simply buying the shares right now. they are choosing to mitigate that risk by buying a call option at the later date, which they can choose (hence, the name option) to exercise at a later time. the ability to mitigate risk is valuable to them, so they pay a commission. 

if i am concerned about the future of apple on the other hand, but not to the degree that i want to sell, i can purchase a put option, giving me the right to sell my shares at a predetermined price, regardless of the actual price. that downside protection, an insurance policy, is valuable to me, so i pay a commission. otherwise, i would have no choice but to either sell and buy more frequently, or else not invest at all unless the risk/reward profile is far more conservative. 

on the other end of the put option transaction is someone with liquid cash, which is valuable. they aren’t interested in a particular security right now, but don’t want to lose money to inflation, so they are willing to sell a put secured by their cash (ie, cash-secured put or csp) in exchange for commission. alternately, they would like to own apple stock, but not at the current price - but would be willing to buy at a price below the current price. either way, they sell a put and someone buys it. 

i can also do both, selling a call and buying a put - this limits my future gains but also protects me from a downturn in the share price, usually for a minimal fee or a small cash gain. 

alternately, more complex options strategies can create cash gains based on a lack of fluctuation in share price - but this is still beneficial economically, because it allows the people on the other end of the transactions to purchase insurance against loss of their capital, and generate income without selling securities. 

of course, people can also buy and sell options without any intention of holding the underlying securities, but this is ok because that increases the liquidity of the options market - more buyers and sellers means it’s easier for other investors to buy or sell options themselves.

so, the results of options sales are: lower market volatility (because i can purchase insurance against capital erosion, and generate income from existing investments) because you have options besides selling and buying shares. increased investment because you can mitigate risk via options. preservation of capital overall because you can generate returns without requiring growth in the value of securities.

to tie it back together - short sellers don’t exist without buyers.",4,,Call_Me_Clark,0

think of where the internet was in 1991, then compare it to 10 years later in 2001.   or where digital photography was in 1999 and then compare that to 2009.  or where the smartphone was in 2000 to 2010.  in a very fast moving field, 10 years can go from something that has nearly zero public adoption to completely taking over and disrupting a marketplace.   a lot of people say things that they wish they could have gone back in time and purchased apple stock, tesla stock,  or amazon stock not realizing that when those companies were cheap people would think you have shit between your ears if you invested money in them.   


earth is a big place.  i am going to confine my rollout scenario to california (because i live here), nevada, and arizona.   its going to be an enormous thing.  my guess is that when commercial service starts, its going to start in this region and while it will be rough at first, and people will assume its not particularly great, eventually it will hit a tipping point where the utility of auto taxis surpasses the utility (at least on a cost basis) of owning a gas powered car.   a significant portion of californians are going to adopt this technology and not bother with the car.  especially in places where car ownership expenses are expensive due to parking.    


my hunch, it will follow the comparable trend of most technology.  there will be 2-3 major players.  think windows/mac os (with linux service a niche crowd), ios and android and even with video games where generally there are only 2-3 major players at any given time.   i don't know who these players will be, but i imagine if you list off your top 5 predictions that at least one of them (or a successor company) will be one of them.  but once there are 2-3 companies all competing in this space there will be a very fast improvement and the door will quickly shut on new companies trying to enter this space.    


think how hard it would be to be a brand new smart phone operating system company.  microsoft, with all their resources, failed to do it.  the big players will be so far ahead of everyone else that when company a and company b are doing full commercial service in los angeles, company c might try to roll out some test vehicles.    by 2032 it will be most likely that the dominate platforms will have been long established.",6,,rileyoneill,0

2 discount calculation can work in different ways, but what i’ve seen usually use lowest of two or more dates. it’s often 15% discount off lowest of 1. the first day of period. 2. the current price at last day of period. 

the discount can end up being significantly  more than 15%. the discount on my last esp ended up being about 27%. 

for instance: 
esp jan 1 period start date: stock price is $100
esp march 31, period end date, stock price $107
lowest of two prices: $100

discounted price = $85. ($100-15%) = $85

if you hold for 1 year, you pay reduced long-term capital gains rate.

1650136914,"in this metaphor, though, is bitcoin the apple stock or is it the iphone? because owning an iphone doesn't really mean that you get a share of apple's profits. you might gain some more value from it as more people adopt iphones and are available to use on imessage or facetime or whatever, but that's not your investment gaining in value, it's the product you use getting more useful due to network effects. likewise, even if the skeptics (myself admittedly included in this number) are wrong and bitcoin does end up being a wildly successful new currency and the foundation of a new economy, that's fantastic for the exchanges and miners and app developers and whoever else is investing in creating something that stands to benefit from that network effect, but it means much less for the value of the tokens themselves, since in order to be adopted at any scale the utility of them has to exceed the purchase price. just owning tokens doesn't give you a revenue stream.

if you think bitcoin is going to take off and want to get real money out of it, then you should be looking to invest in creating the infrastructure that is going to be used once it takes off. but if the primary means of 'investing' in bitcoin is buying the tokens themselves, then it looks an awful lot like a company who's only product is it's own stock. historically, that has not turned out well for the vast majority of shareholders.",16,,YourNetworkIsHaunted,0

1650140407,"&gt;i appreciate the effort, but you can come to the exact same conclusionwith far, far less effort by simply stating that the current trend willcontinue absent a positive catalyst/removal of uncertainty,

yes and no. i can say ""fish walk"" but that does nothing to anyone interested in data-driven analysis, right?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;in terms of actionable advice, same applies with respect to how simply it can be boiled down: don't catch a falling knife

slight disagree again - catching falling knives is voex's specialty and with these data there are plenty of profits to be made in baba's case.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i hope you can also concede that should a positive catalyst/removal ofuncertainty occur, the ""accuracy"" of your model goes to 0%

hehe - this i won't conceed, because gain, voex and the data it is derived from is *quite* potent in these ""catalyst"" style moments. the most recent, for example, was me shouting into the void about $aapl falling off a cliff following their product launch. of course no one wanted to believe the data because, well, its apple! and a new m234 chip! but of course what happened afterwards? apple fell. why? because the forces that predominately move a stocks aren't retail traders anymore. (p.s. you can fact check all this on my twitter).

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;your plus side estimates will be shattered to the upside, just like theywill be to the downside should a negative catalyst/actualization ofrisk occur.

when a stock moves greater than the epr suggests or when it moves against the current holdings / positioning institutional obligations there are characteristic markers that occur to indicate this. there have been times when once-off price action is against voex's data-print but these stocks invariably move back to where they are supposed to be. see my recent dds on $mu (not recent, 4 months old now and just as correct), and $amd.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the stock is going down a ton or up a ton.

i find this to be an odd sentiment, especially if you have stock in this stock (pun intended). to be indifferent to loosing money is an odd position for a trader to take.

it also isn't entirely you're fault - you've probably never been exposed to real market data before. that is part of why i am taking dds outside of just managing my own portfolio with voex. there's been this indoctrination that the market is just completely random. this is far far from the truth and there is actually incredibly percision that you can assign to future stock's price actions.

crypto on the other hand is so volatile that for the last 2 years there is no ""past performance"". hourly you can swing from being rich to destitute with no real gain unless you actually sell at a peak. if you assume the next 10 years will produce returns like the previous 10 (or worse that this return is guaranteed) i believe you will be sorely disappointed.",1,,kvUltra,0
1650167326,"amazon, apple stock split, it’s the same point. when a company goes through a stock split, the company maintains the same market value without dilution. the scenarios are not analogous to a poison pill.

let’s say twitter did a stock split at 2:1 right now. with 800 million outstanding, they go to 1600 million outstanding and slash the price in half. the market cap is the same, thus the value of the company is the same and each shareholders position is the same relative to the company. elons position would still remain the same, as would every other twitter shareholder.

a poison pill allows the board to just increase the volume of shares to be taken to market, but the position of the shareholders stay the same unless they choose to purchase the additional stock that’s issued. if they don’t buy, their position is less because the value is diluted with the additional stock that’s been issued out of thin air.

and yes, if you’ve been trading stocks for 15 years you would know through a stock split, if you held say 10 stocks of a company through a 2:1 split, you’d have 20 shares but the price which you could sell is half the original price for each of the 20 shares that you had the moment before at a 1:1 position. your relative value stayed constant, you just have 20 shares instead of ten.

1650173171,"it's complicated, i'm a fund manager by trade, and like to familiarize myself with all the new offerings. m1 is interesting as it's essentially a robo-advisor without a fee.

that said, there is academic muster behind my concerns here. m1's methods are more convenient from the perspective of keeping a portfolio to a certain allocation and making taxes simple.

that said, it goes against basic indexing theory. with all traditional indexes, we invest more in companies that are performing better.

you can look at the returns of $rsp (equal-weight s&amp;p) vs. $spy, or $qqew vs. $qqq for examples of how equal weighting performs versus market cap weighting, which is what i'd prefer.

yes, we can choose our own weighting, but that weighting is necessarily relative. whether i'm holding 1% in $aapl or 10% in $aapl and $aapl's market cap goes up by 50%, it'd get 50% more contributions with traditional indexing.

with m1, $aapl going up +50% would mean this entire value would go to *every other holding* first, and then to the &gt;+50% cohort next.

i don't see a need to complicate things further; you seem smart enough, so i'll just leave it at that. m1 is doing the opposite of what traditional indexing does, which is a tried and true method that's delivered consistent and fair market returns to investors since before i was born.

i just want more options, more granuality, and more transparency over what the effects are on a portfolio by choosing these options.

all that said, i've found m1's execution quality to be tragic, and whoever's handling their block trades has an incredibly sweet deal. the afternoon window seems a lot better, but after tracking ~300 buys during the morning window, ~99% of the buys are a statistically significant level above vwap that cannot be explained by chance or specific timing.

i'm trying; and am working on a whole substack piece about m1, but it's going to take a lot more time.

i'd stick to just a couple highly liquid index funds with m1, and will be recommending that to clients going forward due to slippage and rebalancing concerns. it's tough to figure out how to recommend a way around the rebalancing thing, but i'll likely suggest that people contribute fixed amounts per-slice (and let the dynamic rebalancing happen within a slice, not to overcomplicate things).

i bet toys r us could make a come back as the goto place to shop for toys in retail and online with their retail shops being like fulfillment centers.  basically the gamestop model.  amazon is massive, but other markets can still exist online (i.e. gaming, jewelry, toys, just like they existed in real life outside walmart.  

amazon is becoming the walmart of online.  i really don't trust a lot of stuff even if it has good ratings.  it's mostly cheap crap and you can tell one product becomes ubiquitous from many different sellers that there are behind the scenes monopolies....load of individual sellers for the same item probably all owned by the same company.  amazon ""recommends"" one but it is one they manufacture themselves after stealing the idea.

1650305402,"i commend you on your courage! 💜💜💜
in 4 days, it will be 4 years since my aunt-mother died. aunt-mother = biological aunt, mother by adoption. 
i was in a brutally abusive home. my bio mother tried to kill me any chance she got. i was kicked, stabbed, punched, scratched, burned, left unconscious to die, and shot. and that’s just a short description. i was in hell on earth. i would lay on the floor, unable to move, and waited to die. i cried but no sound came out and no tears flowed. i couldn’t tell for help. 
my auntie literally saved my life. i’ve had chronic pain since age 6 because of it and i have no pain free days. 
my aunt-mother did everything for me. i can’t even try to explain how much. i can say that because of her, i was able to study music and i started singing in churches for money since age 7. the money was placed in a trust fund. i got into every college i applied to. i went to college, got a degree in administration of justice and worked in that field. i saved every extra penny i had and lived modestly. 

at 29, i met and married a man who was 18 years older. no daddy issues. my dad legit passed away the day before my 4th birthday. we decided before getting married to live debt-free except for our mortgage and we would pay it off. we invested wisely. in 2000/2001, we both bought a lot of apple stock and let it sit. today, just that stock is worth $millions$. plus my retirement fund, his and our other retirement accounts that include that stock. 

at 40, i went and got another degree and became a nurse. i have worked in pain for my whole life. i’m in the process of retiring right now at 53 because pain management is a full time job. 

hubby retired at 67 and we moved to florida because the weather would help with pain management. that was 4 years ago and was in the same month my aunt-mother died. she insisted that i was not going to sit and watch her die. she was ready. 

because of her, i learned about money. i learned how to find a good man who would never hurt or abuse me. i am fortunate to not have any mental health issues. sadly, my brother does. i got the physical pain, he got the mental health pain. sometimes i think he got worse than i did. as a nurse, i know for sure that the body in general is easier to manage than it is to manage the brain…the mind. he does it tho and he’s stable and well. my aunt-mother saved two lives. and then she made us her children. 

he’s a master hair stylist and does well. i’m retiring at 53 with millions of dollars. i’m gonna need it for my health care. but i would not have that without her bringing me up in the world. she was there for every concert, recital, graduation, awards ceremony, musical, parent-teacher conference, and every sport i played…all in pain. 

will i mourn her loss on april 22nd? yes. will i be taking the day off from my soon to be last nursing job? no. believe it or not, i would have to ask someone to switch shifts with me. i’m not going to do that. like you said, a loss in my world wouldn’t factor into theirs. i’m in charge of how i grieve and when i grieve. my aunt-mother was devoted to our care. everyone who knew her, loved her. she had no enemies on this earth. she gave up any opportunity to get married in order to raise me. she said that god put her here to raise me. she really did believe that was true. 

i’m truly sorry for the loss of your child. there’s no name for a parent who loses a child. there are widows and widowers if one loses a spouse. but a parent who loses a child is still called a parent.  blessings to you.",2,,msaretha,0

1650316033,"&gt;	the last couple years, the tsx has had some of the greatest returns, that is true.

if you go back and read my post, i’m not talking about the last couple years for the tsx. i’m talking about a 25 year time frame (multiple boom/bust cycles). that’s not “timing the market”, it’s a long term investment time frame. 

i also acknowledge real estate has been going like gang busters in the last few years. but again, hindsight is 20/20. 

&gt;	so actually, the math still favours property investment, assuming you can afford it or be approved for a mortgage

if you look back at a very narrow window of a couple years for just about any investment, and cherry pick a “perfect” entry and exit point, of course you can show whatever story you want to tell. i could have bought apple stock in 1990 and held for 30 and been a millionaire. so what?

&gt;	but at least if you do ever buy a property, the worst that’ll likely happen is you get a place to live.

or you become underwater on your mortgage and lose your job in a recession, and have to declare bankruptcy because you over-leveraged yourself with borrowed money? small detail you breezed over. leveraging yourself with someone else’s money is always a risk. it’s why not everyone can open a margin account with a brokerage for equities. if that’s perceived as risky, why does housing always get a free pass?

[one of the most important things in investing (not gambling) is to have both a downside and upside strategy and do a lot of dd.     for my downside strategy, it is simple - if i loses \~20%, i am typically out and ask what myself did i miss or were there any over-riding events (war, terrorism, ..). i will continue to watch but rarely do i average down as i view this as throwing good money after bad. you need to remember if you lose 50%, the stock needs to double just to get to even.     for the upside (makes sure you have a price target based on your dd and are actively monitoring the company), i typically sell 1/3 or 1/4 if it grows 25-50% (no harm in taking profits). if it doubles, i sell half and let the remainder ride as i view these as ""free"" shares from my original investment dollars. they become part of ""hold and forget"" portfolio that i only tap if i need the money for a big purchase (car, home remodel, vacation...).     today, my ""hold and forget"" include hon, fb ($19), amd ($2), cc ($6), baba ($60), ge ($6) -   i learned one thing - **slow and steady wins the race**.     good luck.](/r/stocks/comments/u65lf1/how_to_know_when_to_hold_them_and_when_to_fold/i573of9/)

[the value theory is that investing in companies that have depressed stock prices relative to future expected earnings will lead to greater returns. stocks that are like that are usually dogs so a bunch will fail but the winners should make the basket of stocks go up faster than the market. the market might contain winners, but todays winners are tomorrows losers. (sears, ge, etc) if both baskets of returns are driven by outliers, the cheaper stocks should have higher expected returns.  however, i agree with op. this could just be luck because some of those value winners were things like apple and amazon when the stock prices were depressed. it may or may not work out like that in the future. especially since lots of people are attempting the strategy. i also find it convenient that the guy who ""discovered"" factor based investing will sell you factor funds for a fee but only though a salesman \*cough\* advisor who keeps you invested in the strategy.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u68wms/there_might_be_a_few_holes_in_the_strategy/i57d35i/)

1650395505,"i fully acknowledge my privilege, and i am definitely not complaining about it. any landlord that complains means they are not understanding the risks associated with their investment. i don't complain– i do research, i try and make good judgements based on that research, and when i don't, i live with the consequences. i always attempt in all ways to be a fair and considerate landlord.

i acknowledged that landlords have more access to capital, hence why i said ""if you have money squirrelled away"". as soon as you have gone beyond saving for an emergency fund, you begin to try to find ways to make returns on your money.

of course, i know that there is a difference in how you invest money. i have a diversified portfolio invested in many different asset classes. in fact, i have apple stock. i just think that there is a simplicity in the moralistic way people delineate between asset classes.

because you, or people you know, have had negative experiences with landlords, you equate that type of investment as being necessarily bad, while stock/bond investments are good, or at least neutral. i would argue it's just a symptom of immediacy.

apple, for instance, pays little to nothing in tax, takes lots of jobs offshore, sends much of its earnings to a few individuals, has a detritus effect on climate change through its aggressive marketing strategies and planned obsolesce, and stifles competition through monopolistic and predatory practices.

i could argue that a landlord, who is likely a mom and pop investor (most are), pays far higher in property tax alone (let alone passive income tax), keeps the money local and reinvests in local business and has almost no means by which to consolidate wealth and stifle competition.

there are separate arguments to be made: perhaps housing is a human right and therefore should be treated more like a public entity. perhaps, no individual should own land or the properties on them. but if you accept a broadly capitalist/free-market system, i think the differences in asset classes arent so vast, and the demonisation of (good) landlords isn't warranted.",7,,tweetingbishop,0

gold being difficult to transport and expansive to guard is not a good thing. imagine if you are now russian oligarchs with bunch of gold in uk now your gold would be confiscated by uk government. if you had bitcoin in cold wallets your money would be safe.

bitcoin and other crypto also create jobs in mining and passive income in staking etc...

i agree gold has been the most stable currency in history. we also used fire for centuries until electricity was invented.

of course apps and exchanges charge you fee that is the way they stay in business. the banks charges you fee that are even more expansive. as for the taxes comment it depends from country to country but most of the expect you to pay capital gains tax on your profits which is same as if you sold your apple stock for example and now need to pay tax on it.

yes bitcoin supply is safe it was set at 21 million bitcoin and hasn't changed ever.
people who lost their bitcoin and forgot their passwords doesn't have anything to do with compromised safety. their bitcoin wasn't stolen or confiscated or hacked they just couldn't accesse it because of their own negligence and fault or bad luck.

crypto can be manipulated by its creators that is true but i am talking about bitcoin. 
bitcoin has unknown creator that is not control by anyone and can't be targeted by governments.

first thing you need to learn is to stop using term crypto in specific manner as if your arguments apply to all crypto, because i don't know which crypto you mean by that there are thousands of them.
and while bitcoin is crypto other coins have very different aspects compared to bitcoin.

and bitcoin is not used as currency primarily but as store of value and you want your store of value to be valuable and scarce, not to depreciate in value due to inflation every year like fiat money is doing at the moment losing its value above 8% a year.",-2,,Crazyshark22,0

1650456509,"thailand.  

technically, the law says that as long as you don’t bring the money into thailand in the same year as the cap gains were realized, there are no taxes due.  

in reality, thailand never checks and doesn’t care.  

thailand has no practical way of tracking the money or it’s source.  

the law is mostly intended for thai citizens with foreign investments.  it’s not really targeted at expats.  

i don’t know of any retiree that pays any sort of income/investment taxes in thailand on investments not in thailand.  

if you showed up at the tax office and told them you wanted to pay taxes on the $12,000 capital gain you just realized on your apple stock held in your schwab account they wouldn’t even know what to tell you :-)   

i think malaysia and singapore have similar types of foreign capital gains laws.  maybe new zealand as well.  i’m not so sure on that one.  

i know that it may sound like i’m saying that you should break the law, but in thailand (and many sea countries) laws are written broadly and vaguely so one must rely on how the law is enforced.  

thailand has never expressed an intent to tax foreigners on foreign capital gains despite the law being written in such a way as to make it possible.",3,,taradiddletrope,0

ukraine aid, mandate confusion, lyoya autopsy, wh restores nepa, 4/20, diamond sales, gold consolidation? shanghai lifts, silver demand

we saw a big jump late day yesterday in fangmt stocks.

ukraine: offensive has picked up, us officials says russia has sent 11 additional battalion groups (about 20k soldiers)

biden is expected to announce more military support goods/weapons

biggest confusion around new mask mandate (removal of mandate) can private business’ force patrons to wear masks?

police involved shooting that took place in michigan last week, autopsy shows he was shot in the back of the head, could this lead to protests, rallies etc? look for gun stocks and body cam stocks

nepa (national environmental policy act) part of it was taken down during trump admin, that has now been reversed by whitehouse. bad for those trading agriculture, or companies that use chemicals etc. could be good for environmental cleanup companies.

don’t expect weed to have a massive day, we have priced in legalization over the last 2 years, but we could see a momentum run today. 

diamond sales, article that came out that has been picking up steam w/ millennials and buying diamonds. it appears diamonds are making a comeback (check &lt;#961829860743979029&gt; for article)

gold looks like its consolidating after its 5 week run.

tech stops could pop today. shanghai has announced a partial re-opening

tesla has earnings after hours today. goldman sacks came out giving it a 55% chance of beating earnings. 

demand for silver as mines reopen 

$mrna combo shot. omnicron variant w/ their new variant shot

$nflx sub losses

$twtr on watch w/ cryptic elon tweet

$tsla earnings chances from $gs

$uuuu $uroy $uec etc on watch w/ $6 billion nuclear rescue program

no, that's not how that works, but thanks for playing. 

i agree with you that aapl may have ran about 15% too far. that said, while berkshire holds about $180b in aapl shares as assets, brk itself has a market capitalization of about $800b, and a ttm p/e of 9 and 32% average eps growth per year over the last 5 years.

now if a tech stock trading at a multiple over 30 like $nflx &amp; $pypl can not show growth; they are not worthy of a p/e of 30 plus.  they should trade like the value stocks with p/e around 12-18.  that unfortunately means they need to have their stock prices cut in half.",8,,drew-gen-x,0

breakdown is:

* $250k cash
* 1,000 shares msft/yr
* 15-30% bonus
* 15-30% bonus as stock, delivered quarterly over 4 years (so if i were to get a 30% bonus, that'd be like setting aside $75k worth of msft stock at current price, to be delivered quarterly over 4 years). 
* $25k shares msft @ 10% discount
* +$5k misc. income

so all in all, that's currently:

$250k + 1000 shares @ ~$300/share ($300k) + $37.5k to $75k + ~150 bonus shares (~$45k) + ~$2500 (discounted shares) + $5k:

somewhere between $644,500 and $672,500 at a $300 share price, prior to paying taxes.

assuming i catch my next promotion, the cash numbers go up by ~$50k, and the bonus multiplier range doubles (30-60% instead of 15-30%). i doubt i will be awarded additional shares on promotion. effectively, the next promotion is $50k immediate pay, +$45-90k yearly award, $45k-$90k worth of stock / 4yrs (which is harder to calculate). all in all, i can bank on a minimum of ~$100k increase at the next promotion.",1,,AlternativeSherbet,0

where $$v(t) = (x(t), \dot{x}(t))$$

but this gets wierd. so we define 3 different curves:

time-like curves are curves for which g(v,v) each tangent vector on along this curve.

spacelike curves are curves for which this is negative

and light-like curves are curves for which this is zero.

the length of space-like curves would be strictly imaginary, which isn't an issue per se. 

it gets freaky once you take a curve that has space-like and time-like segments, in which case you might get a complex length, but those curves are meaningless for the purpose of lorentzian manifolds (relativity), as such a curve would mean that one would for start at a velocity smaller than the speed of light and accelerate beyond it or vice versa.

thus, in practice we only look at curves that strictly belong to one of these groups and thus see no complex ""lengths"". 

in practice, as there is such a hard split between space-like curves and time-like curves, we often even redefine the length of thede curves by taking integrals of \sqrt{|g(v,v)|} instead.

1650526372,"this is how i think about it: 

**large v. mid v. small:** large cap indices capture a greater share the economy than than mid and small cap indices. they are all highly correlated with one another, but large caps are less volatile. indices that are less volatile are preferred because of how it effect our rational decisioning making process. 

**market cap v stock price**: whether an index is total market index or top 30, 100, 500, 1000 or small cap does matter, but what matters more are what factors get weighted. market cap weights are preferred as stock prices are more volatile being that they can be manipulated by number of shares. the sp, nasdaq, and russell are market cap weighted. the djia is price weighted.

**rebalancing**: major indices are rebalanced either quarterly or annually. quarterly rebalancing is preferred because it capture changes to the economy and markets in a more timely manner. the sp is rebalanced quarterly while the nasdaq and russell are annually. 

**size of index:** each major large cap index has a different size. the djia has 30, sp500 has 500, and the nasdaq composite has 3000. larger indices are preferred over smaller indices.

at the end of the day, it is because rebalancing is more important than index size that the sp500 is more often used and covered than the nasdaq or russell 1000. it also helps that it has simply been around longer. also outlets that cover all indices are also rare because there is little demand it.",2,,mtn_rabbit33,0

1650551840,"if its a 4 year vesting period, why list it as one figure? compensation is annual, you wouldnt say that you make 500k if you make 125 annually. at best, thats how employers list it to try to inflate their perceived value to employees. thats a pretty shit package, i make more at ups while working in bfe.  

faangs arent the only companies in the world, but due to their primary locations, even double that median salary figure is pretty low due to cost of living. 

and if my last comment makes zero sense, you have no clue how stocks or stock compensation works. it does not matter how much the stock is worth when you receive it, it matters how much the stock is worth when you sell it. 

for example, my dad was an early engineer with apple. he received apple stock in the 90s, and moved to dell in 2005. the growth of apples stock means nothing, because he sold when the price appeared high at the time, based on the advice of a broker. 

so, employees want to typically see a long term increase in value for their stock options because a volatile stock is difficult to maximize value at any one point in time.

1650608293,"at the end of the day no one knows what's going to happen. looks like you have a pretty good feel for things, however, so i'll share some of my thoughts that might help complete your theory. 

the only thing i've found reliable is to look at history how frothy markets tend to move in the end game. (whether it be in the dot-com bubble, or the crypto bubble in 2017, etc.) there is a lot of evidence out there that growthy/frothy stocks tend to get pummeled first, and then finally the large caps come down at the very end. i think the rationale is that investors leave the riskiest names first and rotate to safer ones. however, even the safer ones start to become a problem when there are major structural issues/overall pessimism in the markets. bull markets don't last forever and sometimes having no position is the best thing.

so far it's playing out exactly how it played out in the dot-com bubble. i've been shorting speculative/high ps ratio stocks since november, got cut a little bit on the rebound in late march, but have been recently closing them. last week i began sizing into shorts in expensive large cap stocks like $cost, $aapl, $abbv, $de, to name a few. while growthy names can continue to slide downwards, the risk-reward isn't there anymore. most of the names i shorted ($cvna, $net, $hubs, $shop, etc.) have had large enough drawdowns and asking for another 50% more would be asking a lot. the large cap non-tech stocks i mentioned above, however, are a completely different story. you're spot on with the likes of $cost. they are extremely expensive right now, and while i wouldn't expect a 50% drawdown, i think a 20-30% drop is reasonable from here to reset valuations.

the stock market hasn't been listening to the bond market for the past few weeks. when it eventually does, turbulence will come fast. honestly, you really can't fault funds/investors/retail for greeding hard for large-cap names like $aapl and $cost.  a true bear market hasn't happened for more than a decade. in that time span, fortunes and careers were made off of being a perma-bull. unfortunately, the vast majority of investors are perma-bulls now. who can blame them? year after year it's been ingrained in every investor that being a bear is a losing endeavor. buy the f*cking dip if you want to succeed. only when you see the large-cap names fall will the s&amp;p500 enter a true bear market. only when we have a real bear market will stubborn perma-bulls be wiped away.",2,,aquaBluu,0

[of course.. i just finished my day or at least for now.   yes you still fill out your buy/sell request. but that’s the entire length of time i’m in. yet, that only applies to “zip &amp; dips” or quick runs. a “zip” meaning you see that sexy quick almost 90 degree upward trend whereas a “dip” is just that a crash, not a “pull back” a straight crash! on zips i buy and immediately exit, basically “riding” it temporarily. we don’t see many these days for some reason? about a year ago they were extremely common. moving on.. now if it’s a short you pre type that order and are literally waiting to click send to cover. since the market has been a tad.. erratic. i primarily short.   why? because 70% of all equities will fall vs rise - fact! research it yourself. it’s one of the weird things i was taught when going through (1) of the million classes for my phd. getting a phd is massively emphasized on research design so statistics naturally goes hand in hand. 70% may not seem like a huge amount but it’s better than 30% right? you can count in a session the up and down trends and find minimally in favor of a down trend but over longer periods (the key to statistics) you’ll see that 70%. it can be much higher on many equities!   great example is i’ve traded amc already (7) times making just over $5k not bad for an hours work. i also have another equity on “auto” pilot to see what it does.. it’s not worth mentioning as it’s an extremely low investment and i’m trying out a friend’s algorithm. yes, this is running on his pc. i’m at his place now. that is what is so special about using a tablet, the freedom to go wherever.   this algorithm is sweeeeet! it actually is exactly what the mm’s use to manipulate (ok, “control”) the market. (i don’t want to make it sound like trading isn’t “fair”.🙄) but any trader knows it’s not! one glance at level (2) is all one needs to see. i realize this is off topic but he is a software writer and wrote this for me specifically. i’m paying a grip of $ for its sole ownership. he has it where i set up all the indicators i want, how i want them how many shares, short or traditional orders, etc. it’s actually really impressive. this is our 1st “live” use, meaning with real money. it’s playing with $100k and doing exactly what i normally would on my own. i’ll keep you all updated. btw, you can purchase algorithms off of the net or join clubs using them. the problem is they from my experience don’t work as well as indicated. as i type this the account is + $2k. so it needs “tweaking” but it’s oddly a lot of fun!](/r/daytrading/comments/u8d8yd/if_you_had_to_use_a_mobile_iphone_trading/i5miqd5/)

[no. it's completely different.  some family offices and hedge funds have hardwires in the actual exchange that cost thousands (if not millions) a year. i need to look further into that.  although ibkr pro and lightspeed route orders directly to the exchange, they are not physically located in the building and will always take longer to send your orders to the exchange. it's not a matter of ""direct access"" vs. no ""direct access."" it's just that their direct access is even more direct by virtue of having hardwires in the building with millisecond latency responses.  the way family offices and hedge funds with hardwires in the building trade vs. retail isn't even in the same league. not only can they send their orders more quickly, they can perform sweep orders, which automatically eliminate all the bids on the level 2 to quickly sell and get out of a position.  that's what happened with stss when 100,000 shares were sold as a sweep, and not even lightspeed or ibkr pro can save your ass when that happens if that type of order triggers at the same time or before your stop.  the only way around it is to do better ta and have better stops. my stop at $3 was too low. a higher stop would have helped.  but this information is important for retail traders to know because it gives you a sense of who you're up against with some of these trades and how to react and prepare accordingly in order to deal with people that simply have more resources and better trading technology than you do.](/r/daytrading/comments/u7swhu/how_common_is_it_for_family_offices_and_small/i5l8pgq/)

because the armor that looks very similar to a late ww1 jager/sturmann, and a ww2 wermacht uniform with a gas mask, is called **iron eagle**.

the majority of the fanbase are fools so i am not surprised, that the executives who run 343i, think that the so called 'bellowed fans' have zero historical knowledge. (their latest hire was a ""monetisation engineer"")

""more hysteria, than history.""

i remember reading, that hunt the truth and that type of story telling along with karen traviss's story telling from the late 2000s and early 2010s, were thrown out by microsoft because oni = cia, and the unsc is shown as a corporate state, that doesn't care about the average population, and constantly lies to them, even in the middle of the war. hunt the truth has odst veterans in poverty who fought hard for earth, just to be tossed aside.

microsoft got complaints that as a supplier of the us military and of civilian intelligence agencies such as the nsa, it cannot promote, ""anti-american views"". and investors were encouraged to move away from microsoft stock.

so the writers were told not to be political.

but instead of saying: ""the powers that be; don't want us to tell our story, because it makes them look bad"", they went to say: ""we are staying away from politics, and want to make a simpler story"".  
when in reality they would have been replaced with people who would have accepted what microsoft wanted anyway, a pay check is a paycheck. 

i am just amazed that the liars call the the truth, lies. but what is new? eh?

people who are sheep like, are very embarrassed when they start to realise that they have been conned, but as a defense mechanism they just push the ostrich head deeper into the sand.

the reason halo 5 felt without a story and halo inf, is hollow story wise. because the original well built story, made through a few years of thinking, was challenging what was happening in real life.   


1. propaganda that whitewashes whatever the intelligence agency does.
2. child soldiers.
3. war crime after war crime while calling the others war criminals.

1650648380,"there are entire realms within crypto that you are, and i say this as a fact, completely ignorant of. 

many of the newer crypto projects / services are structured in a similar way to startups/corporations. and they are valued similarly too.

there is ownership. and creating value for owners. there is governance. there is a focus on generating revenue / profit. 

a few key differences with most cryptos: 

\- you can self custody (meaning you can control the asset, just like you would control a bar of gold that you keep in a safe at home, but unlike a bar of gold, you can send it digitally to anyone in the world)

\- ability to self-custody a digital asset means that you can use it like a currency, send it to anyone or pay for things with it. people just don't do this with apple stock bcs it's technically infeasible, but crypto opens that door and makes it cheap and easy to pay with something that also represents an ownership stake in a crypto-based service. 

\- you don't need to wait for a liquidity event or an ipo to sell your stake. most ownership stakes in crypto are not time-locked in this way. you can sell your tokens / shares at any time. this is a total game changer. it means that you don't have to be a vc or founder or an accredited investor to get in early. and it means you don't have to wait 10yrs for an ipo to realize your gains.

i recommend spending 30-60min looking at some of the top 15-25 cryptos listed on [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com) or coinmarketcap - just as a way to get an idea of what these projects are doing.",1,,SwimmingInSugar,0

1650724113,"apple was a major player in the 80s (which i’m too young to remember) when they were basically the inventors of the “personal computer.” the apple ii was steve wozniak’s brainchild and was extremely popular. the macintosh was created in the mid-80s. it was the first computer sold with a graphical user interface and a mouse (both technologies were invented by xerox but were gifted to apple due to xerox executives’ shortsightedness). 

meanwhile, microsoft was making a killing with dos. bill gates and steve jobs were friends at the time, and gates convinced jobs to allow microsoft to write productivity software for the macintosh. gates then had microsoft reverse engineer the mac os and used it to create windows 1.0. since windows could run on much cheaper computers, apple started losing market share. steve jobs also got fired from apple for being a massive asshole around this time and went to work on other projects (most famously buying pixar from george lucas and turning it into what we know today). 

by the mid-90s, apple was basically dead. they came within about 2 weeks of declaring bankruptcy and shutting down. ten years after firing him, apple rehired steve jobs to lead the company for $1/year (plus benefits). steve jobs reached out to bill gates and they made a deal. microsoft would buy $150 million worth of apple stock, which made them the largest shareholders at 5.9%. apple dropped their lawsuits against microsoft and gave them access to write software for the mac. steve jobs took the money and used it to turn apple around, launching the famous multi-coloured imacs in 1998 and then, critically, the ipod in 2001, moving apple into a new market. and of course, the crown jewel, in 2007 they released the iphone and went on to become the biggest company in history.",1,,thefinalcutdown,0

i don't need to close anything out in a panic, but i definitely got the wakeup call that i can't take any more new positions until i close out old ones.

my big positions include:

when i was 10 years old and my brother was a baby our grandmother bought us each ten shares of apple stock so we could learn about investing. they cost her $30 each, so $300 for each of us. i hung on for ten years, reading the stock quotes in the business section of the newspaper everyday and freaking out over the headlines. i was clearly not made for stocks, as every tick up or down sent me through a whirlwind of anxiety. eventually they invented imacs and the stock split. the company offered to buy me out at this point and i wanted out, so i took the deal. $300 investment, sold for $1,000. i was a poor college student and thought i had done some savvy investing...shortly thereafter they invented ipods, then iphones, and the stock split a bunch more times. ten years after that my brother sold his stock for $20,000. then they invented ipads, apple watch, etc. the last time i ran the numbers that initial $300 investment would be worth $70,000 today.

tl;dr my grandma taught me about the stock market, but the lesson was learned the hard way.",1,,Marxbrosburner,0

if i invested $1,000 in apple stock in 1990, how much would it be worth today?

[quora answer](https://www.quora.com/if-i-invested-1-000-in-apple-stock-in-1990-how-much-would-it-be-worth-today/answer/haje-jan-kamps)

a share of apple on january 1, 1990 would have cost around $1.20 that means that $1,000 of shares would have bought you 833 shares or so.

apple’s stock has split four times since the company went public. the stock split on a 7-for-1 basis on june 9, 2014 and split on a 2-for-1 basis on february 28, 2005, june 21, 2000, and june 16, 1987.

the 1987 split wouldn’t have affected you, but:

after 2000 you would have had 1,666 shares.

after 2005 you would have had 3,332 shares.

after 2014 you would have had 23,324 shares.

today’s stock price for aapl is $190 or so. \(actually only $161.79 today - 04/23/2022\).

23,324 shares times $190 is $4,431,560, or around $4.43 million dollars.",1,,GardenGnomeOfEden,0

compared to bitcoin, if everyone wanted to sell their bitcoin tomorrow for a penny each, and you bought up all of them, you'd have all the bitcoin - it doesn't do anything for you, the only thing you can do with bitcoin is to send it to another address.",12,,mutqkqkku,0
1650755506,"&gt; supply of and demand for a given stock are all that determine its price

this is correct in a very wrong way.

if a lot of people suddenly start craving apples tomorrow - yes, their price will go up. but eventually it will hit the limit of what normal person would consider fine to pay for apples, and then the demand would stay high while there will be no supply *for the price people are willing to pay*. 

this is how stock market works too. no matter how much people want to buy microsoft stock - if microsoft has nothing to show for it - nobody will buy it if the price seems too high. in other words, the price is backed by actual real life things - calories in apples and cash flows of microsoft. sure, a lot of this is speculation and hype, but you have at least a very rough guideline where you can calculate that ""no, with the current cash flows of microsoft - it's stupid to buy it for this price"".

in case of crypto though - the *only* thing it's price represents is the hype behind crypto. if the hype goes up - the price goes up, and vice versa. there exists no rational way to evaluate what price is ""too high"" or ""too low"", because there is literally nothing backing crypto. 

let me give you a concrete example. it's kind of the same as with nfts. say i have 100 dollars, and you have just freshly mined 100 buttcoins. i want to pay 100 dollars for them, and you want to sell them for 100 dollars. we shake hands and exchange the assets. this sets the price as 1 butc = 1 usd. so do we now together have 200 usd worth of assets? where did the other 100 come from?",5,,amakai,0

buy microsoft stock! 

this could've saved so much financial bs from happening, as i would've had the money to do what i wanted, and

brian stays home! (long: sorry) 

my brother's best friend (and our next door neighbor) always spent as much time with my family as he could. the lady across the street (brian's mom)  was a single mom, and quickly got married to a boozy douche bag that gave her two daughters; they were everything to brian. as brian got older mr. douchebag decided he didn't want b around anymore, and sent him to live with relatives in kentucky. at 19 he cleaned himself up (brian did a lot of booze and drugs), got a small apartment, was promoted at his job (at a small store) and even got a girlfriend. 

we were told that he was on his way home from work when he accidentally cut off some 'folks' at a light, and they chased him, cut him off on a dirt road, and beat him to death with a tire iron and a baseball bat. someone found him in a ditch; he crawled in it and died from massive head injuries. the people were caught (two men and a woman) and they were acquitted (from what i remember) and paid a fine. my brother visits his grave when he can, and years later, ran into his sister shannon (now grown up) and was so teary eyed they couldn't speak. (to say my brother was destroyed by the loss is an understatement; my mom even had a small shrine with his pic and a candle; ""forever nineteen"".)

[aws is *a substantial part* of that backbone. but i think it’s hyperbolic to call it *the* backbone. why aren’t azure and google cloud part of the backbone as well?  youtube fills niches that aren’t filled by tiktok. tiktok only hosts short videos, but youtube has entire playlist filled with hour long videos. great for educating yourself.   yes, people care **a lot** about search engines. you claim google brings “nothing truly innovative that pushes technology forward”, but that’s just false. their search engine ai is insane. almost sentient honestly.   quick background: many search engines use something called (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tf–idf) for ranked retrieval. basic idea: given a query, the best documents to return are the ones that contain that query a lot. but to avoid selecting based on frequent words like “the”, we assign more weight to rare words. this is how i would implement a search engine, and many off-brand search engines do a souped up version of this  google’s algo started off relatively simple like this, but it has since evolved into something too complex for me to understand, let alone describe to you. the model is constantly being trained on petabytes of new data; other engines simply don’t have that luxury. not many people know how to use search engines properly, yet google consistently returns good results on garbage queries. “not truly innovative” you say?](/r/stocks/comments/u9g0bq/which_stock_do_you_think_will_be_the_1st_to_reach/i5s30qu/)

[yes, absolutely, i dont expect goog going back to 3000 before election, and in terms of inflation and probably compensation package will go up as well.  however, since it's less exposed to inflation, let's say raw materials like ni for tsla's case, i doubt it will have meaningful result. on top of that goog is the leader in ai, and they can start to get rid of software engineers when ai is starting to code, solve issues, and do customer services, so the uptick pressure is limited.   software engineers in precovid time looking for 100k now may be wanting to get 120k-130k (depending on location, though), if not 150k, but not like looking for compensation package as 180k like the case of sbux barista/wmt truck drivers, who've been demanding increase from 10-12$ to 20$ (almost 80% increase), and 70k to 100k (almost 50% increase), respectively.  i mean, they need people to run management and do office stuffs, but i am saying that the labor cost pressure isn't high as much as, i would say, cost/wmt/vz/t/sbux employees that are now demanding 20$ per hours from 10-12$ per hours before pre-2020 (or pre-covid), simply because no one works there in these mortal/brick. technically, today's sweat shop factory is ones dealing with customers with little to no supports from corporate like the case of t/vz/sbux/wmt/cost warehoue employees, which is why they are having hard time to find candidates but when it comes to high skilled workforces, you can see mr. john has b.s. degree, and as long as employers are willing to train, most of office jobs are suitable for any candidates as long as that candidate doesnt have mental/physical issues.      so my point being here is, labor cost to goog/msft, is limited. sure, for upper middle to senior positions, they would spend more to get someone on board when the position is about to create more revenues, but every day offices jobs whether it's back-end and front-end, there are tons of job seekers, and you wont get hired to goog simply because you graduate from ivy league university with electrical/computer engineering.](/r/stocks/comments/ua5hjm/bear_case_for_googgoogl/i5vw6n7/)

1650808184,"[prices are dictated by supply and demand. the supply of tesla shares is relatively inelastic so an analysis of why tesla shares are demanded more than they should be is probably equivalent. basically, musk, the persona is probably overvalued. with that said, he clearly knows how to navigate the finance world (aka toy around with the sec), the political world (aka acquire government subsidies and government contracts), and possibly most importantly the meme world (aka that's a joke). is that worth a premium? sure. but how much? can we pretend that korea and japan are going to sit back and not subsidize the heck out of their evs letting tesla have free reign?     now i'm not even a tesla doomer. call me an idiot but i'm an efficient markets guy. but i do advocate for a simple metric is what is known as:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-point_estimation  for tesla it goes something like:  best case: tesla, starlink, and spacex become the single greatest unified group of companies delivering the fastest global information network tech, the most important space defence tech, the most important battery tech, the most important ai/robot tech.  worst case: tesla, starlink and spacex all get outcompeted due to uncompetitive us regulation and foreign competition. for tesla that would be asia's automakers (aided with asia govt subsidy) repeating what they did to ford in the 20th century. for starlink and spacex, i can see governments just competing with them themselves. usa already has nasa, but i wouldn't put it past countries like india, china, or russia to compete with spacex or starlink. although when your competitors are literally countries it does say you're doing something right.   most likely case: i'm getting tired of writing so i'll just say the most likely case for musk's company just looks a lot like what they look like today.  arguing that tesla is overvalued is as simple as saying that the probability of the best case is overweighted by most people etc. i don't believe that but it really is that simple.](/r/stocks/comments/ua4jpu/bill_gates_has_half_a_billion_dollar_short/i5vsr16/)

[billionaires are not ""rich"". they are genuine forces of power in modern-day society (only speaking about usa, i can't say shit about other countries)  when you get ""rich"", you have a few million in the bank, maybe even double digit millions.  when you become a billionaire, that is a very very large amount of society entrusting you with *power*. it's barely even money at that point. you have so much of it it's just raw influence to society as a whole. nobody *earns* billionaire status on their own. at best they luck into some of it, some of it is given by governments/the masses, some of it is given by their families. at worst... well it's much worse.  i have yet to see a single billionaire with the true intention of helping society on a grand scale, something they are literally entrusted to do with the money they have been given. they all use their influence to better their own personal situation and that of their families. they lie, break laws, and block others from gaining wealth alongside them.  gates and musk are a great examples of people who display an image of good intention, but dig deep enough and you will find nothing but savage business practices that leave others destitute. whether it be fellow company owners (musk), poor people (buffet), or foreign people (gates). or all of the above (all billionaires).  this is a little too broad of a topic for me to really show how i feel about billionaires in just a comment reply, but this is a surface sweep of my opinion. i'm not saying ""nobody should be a billionaire"" but billionaires should be held to a much more rigorous set of rules than basically any other sole individual, due to their influence.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uaa36c/whats_with_the_hate_boner_for_bill_gates/i5wyndk/)

[profit margins aren't being squeezed. look at the data, like you suggested. profit margins are at all time highs, as corporations use inflation as an excuse to raise rates. and since much of the economy is consolidated, there is little competition available to drive prices down. for instance, look at beef... we are already nearly at normal production levels yet prices are still through the roof. ranchers are actually getting paid less, yet meat costs more. why? because 80% of the distribution chain is owned by an oligopoly who sets the rules and does what they want. they are hitting insane profits.   the printing of money only becomes an issue when it comes into the hands of people to increase their demand faster than production can keep up. but in the case of the usa, for instance, the overwhelming majority of that money was dumped into the market and things like real estate, so it didn't hit consumer hands to allow them to increase demand. hence why home rates and the stock market was hot as hell through the money printing (that's where the inflation was going because that's where the money was going).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u9l4iv/bear_market_confirmed_its_time_to_resurrect_the/i5vmmbf/)

the s&amp;p 500 index tracks 500 select stocks weighted by market capitalization, which is the total number of shares the company has issued times the stock price. so, for example, aapl may represent 1.00% of the index. if aapl’s stock price moves up a little bit and all the other 499 stay the same, aapl may now represent 1.01% of the index. 

the s&amp;p 500 isn’t a product you can invest in; it’s a metric calculated by standard and poor (s&amp;p). so many companies create their own product (etf, mutual fund) to mimic the s&amp;p 500 as closely as possible. this requires regular buying and selling of the 500 stocks to keep track as closely as possible with the changing market capitalizations (read: stock price) of the 500 stocks. e.g., in the aapl example above, the fund manager would need to buy more aapl stock to reflect its larger representation of the index. note that such buying and selling that the fund manager is doing is not because of their views of the value of the stocks but merely to track the index as closely as possible. this is an index (or passive) fund.",13,,dukerau,0

[the markets don't care about current earnings, they care about earning expectations. if the market believes rates will continue to rise and earnings growth will continue weaken then that dramatically changes valuations.  i think most companies will probably post decent earnings this quarter, but the thing to look out for is the guidance. for example, if goog says they project digital ad spend growth to slow in the coming year due to reopening trends and weakening business confidence then valuations need to come down. same could happen with aapl as they're probably one of the most sensitive companies a weaker consumer. even if iphone sales were great this quarter if they anticipate they could slow in the coming quarters then the stock is going to fall.  i do agree that some people are too bearish right now though because economic conditions are changing so quickly it's silly to be all in or all out. it's quite possible over the next few weeks we could get some positive news that will act as a support for current valuations. china ending lockdowns or russia ending the war in ukraine for example would be seen as very favourably by the market. the big one though would be signs that inflation is peaking. even if inflation remains elevated for some time a clear peak in the inflation data would take away the risk of an even more hawkish fed and a potential recession.  things could easily get worse though, and it's not hard to imagine how that might happen given all the risks. still, most stocks are down significantly from their highs already. it's worth remembering how in the average bear market stocks fall around 30% and there's a ton of really great companies down 20% or more right now. i don't think buying a goog or amzn is a bad move at all, even if you are bearish on the economy.](/r/stocks/comments/ubj3g5/i_think_youre_all_too_bearish/i64f1ai/)

1650901118,"&gt;  but i’ll explain why i disagree

another strawman.  i didn't ask what you disagreed about.  i asked what was in any way factually incorrect.  you can't find anything technically at fault. you merely ""disagree.""

&gt;explain how something like usdc or tether is a ponzi, when it doesn’t grow in value and isn’t used an an investment

strawman #2.  i never said usdc or tether are ponzis.  these are a different type of fraud. those are merely unsecured stablecoins that have not been [properly audited](https://i.imgur.com/buhqfqw.jpg).

i said ""crypto as an investment is a ponzi"".  stablecoins are not supposed to be investments.  they're just proxies for fiat, although they're a scam in a different way because there's no proof their claims of being 1:1 fiat backed are true.

&gt;every operator of a ponzi scheme stamped their face to it, told the investors there was something they would do to give them a return, (eg, sell the stamps,) and then paid them off with the investment of later folk. 

it's not a requirement that a ponzi have a single, central operator.  crypto proves you don't need a central operator to create a ponzi.  plus there are [plenty of ponzis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ponzi_schemes) that were de-centralized in various ways, especially involving satellite agents. 

there's ample evidence in my original article that there's lots of deception and false promises made in the industry.  the whole ""to the moon"" and ""\#wagmi"" memes are examples of deception and false promises.  

&gt;secondly, how are investors compensated with the profits of new investors? because the more people that buy in=the more it grows? i know you hate this line of reasoning and call it a fallacy, but dude, our whole financial world is a ponzi scheme according to you. 

crypto creates no value.  the *only* way you profit in crypto is by taking money from greater fools who buy in later.  that's the *only* source of income.  

other things are not ponzis.  the stock market is not a ponzi scheme.  stocks represent shares in real world companies that can create value via products and services.  it's painful that this even needs to be explained to somebody out of elementary school.

&gt;they key part, paying off investors, is just what isn’t here. no old bitcoin investors receive a check when someone new buys in, it’s just not how it works. 

yes it is how it works.

when someone new comes in, they pay off/cash out someone earlier in the scheme.  crypto has no use or utility other than as a speculative token an early buyer hopes to sell to a later buyer.  the only value attributed is through marketing and peer pressure.  

if i own shares of apple, they create products. whether you think apple stock has value is meaningless.  they create value and as a shareholder, i'm entitled to a fractional representation of their business.  crypto has no such attributes.  it's nothing like traditional investments.  it's not actually an investment at all.  it's a speculative commodity - and yes people can treat stocks like speculative commodities as well, just like i can make a bet on when a traffic light will turn red - that doesn't mean traffic lights are gambling devices.  they were designed and used for specific purposes.  crypto has no such design other than as a speculative token.

&gt;like i said, if i start asking people to invest in the yen because i think it’s a solid investment, am i now running a ponzi?

wow.. you can't seem to understand the difference between an investment and a currency. those are two different concepts.  eth and bitcoin are no longer currencies - they failed at that a long time ago, and have been re-branded as an investment.  currencies need to be stable to be useful and not fluctuate rapidly in value.  crypto is too volatile to be a currency.  which is why it's not being sold as an investment.  it's crappy at both.  for more info see: https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoreality/comments/pyn7c9/why_crypto_is_a_worse_more_volatile_and_more/",1,,AmericanScream,0

you may think that crypto is a scam, but it is not a ponzi scam by definition because nobody recruits anybody (it is anonymous by design so they wouldn't even know who recruited who) and nobody has to share their profits with anyone. if person a bought one bitcoin in 2012 and person b bought one bitcoin in 2022, they both own an equal amount of bitcoin and person a has no advantage over person b despite coming in a decade earlier. it is true that person b paid more for his bitcoin but that is true for any stock or commodity in the market, we all wish that we could have bought apple stock at 1980s prices but we can't do that without a time machine. in fact, bitcoin costs less today than it did 2 years ago so people buying in today get in at better prices than those who came before. that never happens in a proper ponzi scheme.

1650951096,"if you zoom way out you can see the reason the stock market has done so well the last twenty years is cause the economy has been doing worse and worse. 

this has caused the federal reserve to print money in the form of qe and stimulus to prop all these asset classes up. 

this is where the saying “don’t fight the fed” has come from. remember this saying. 

so long as the fed is printing more new money and lowering interest rates then yes ride out any dips and bear markets, even buy those dips. 

assets are really just someone else’s debt so the counter party risk is immense. it makes the system unravel if things start to crash. 

they desperately don’t want that. 

so rather than let things crash they have just printed new money, essentially loaning it to themselves. 

this has caused asset inflation and that’s why the stock market and real estate have gone up so much. 

but it’s also accelerated the breaking of this system. now it’s to the point where it’s starting to collapse. 

casual investors don’t realize this quite yet. 

it’s causing inflation so now the fed has to stop or they risk making inflation way way worse. 

so now they have stopped printing new money, are letting treasuries roll off their balance sheet and also are raising interest rates. 

all of these are bad for stocks. super bad that it’s all 3 at the same time. 

but investors largely don’t remember a time before the fed was printing so it’s been a bull market for over a decade. 

well don’t fight the fed. right? 

well now they have stopped supporting these asset classes and now they will collapse. 

stocks, real estate and bonds will all collapse. to a lesser degree so will commodities. 

so what the smart money has done is slowly over 6-9 months sell high and trickled their money out slowly as to not shock the system and start the crash but snuck their money out. 

they’re sitting in cash waiting to buy back in as well as investing in certain emerging markets, metals, mining stocks, commodities, futures. 

at some point things will crash too much risking a bad recession (some think depression) and the fed will reverse course again and start to print massive amounts of money again. 

that is when i’d be willing to get back in stocks if i’m looking for income rather than just investing long term. when they do the stock market will shoot up up up. 

real estate is also in deep shit. it’s just a lot slower to feel the effects because it’s so much less liquid. 

i sold all my rental properties in 2019.  

the real long term play if you’re young and don’t need to draw off any of this as income is to buy and cold store bitcoin and ethereum. 

that’s the new macro play and it’s the best asymmetrical bet i’ve ever seen. ever. 

it’s still super early right now and i’d wager 99% of investors don’t understand it yet but it has an easy 100x growth play coming over the next two decades. 

it’s how this broken inflationary system we live under right now will transition to a deflationary one and shore things up. 

i sold over a million in apple stock and have it in cash. 

i’ve still got $400k worth in there because i think it’s a blue chip that others will sell to buy for awhile still but i’ve got most of my money in bitcoin and ethereum and won’t sell any of that and i buy more every week. 

i think soon most all the markets crash as the fear will keep building and building till people say fuck it no mas and dump. 

i think bitcoin crashes right along with stocks and that is the dip i will buy up. 

i’ve got buy orders set at 30k, 25k and 20k. 

that’s how i see it. that’s my investment plan.

1650979626,"don’t do this.  this is not “real” investing.  this is giving a friend money, and clearly, neither of you have the experience, or legal status, to be “investing” on anyone else’s behalf.  there are two guaranteed outcomes here. you will lose your money, and you will lose your friend. 

if you really want to learn about investing, get your own account. $500 is a relatively small amount to start with, so buy cheap stocks. apple stock, for example , is over $160 a share, so you couldn’t even get 3 shares. even if it doubles, you don’t make that much. 

if you want you friend to help you pick stocks, let him. then buy him dinner.  if you get super lucky, and some $1 stock he picks, that you own 100 shares of explodes over the next year, and you make some money, share some if you like. but you are under no obligation.  

but factor in your losses too.  real financial advisors don’t get paid on one stock going up and you making a few bucks off it.  they get paid off the overall performance of your portfolio for the year.  if one stock did great, but the rest lost money, and overall you’re about even, they don’t make anything, (or much, depends on the specific details.)

but learn yourself.  don’t count on, or treat a friend as, as financial advisor.  in the long run, you will both lose.


ps- to the “but what if my friend makes me a lot of money/makes me rich?” concept?  if you friend knows that much about stocks, and gives you advice that turns $500 into a ton of money, but didn’t have the money/faith to invest himself, and now needs your money, something is wrong, and it’s a scam, and you just got lucky. run. if you made bank off $509 and his advice, he should have made a lot more. so, the cut of your profit wouldn’t mean anything to him. 

what he would want, would be your trust, so that now that you have some real money, you might invest it with him on larger, more or official/legal projects.  if he was legit.",10,,Polywantsa,0

1650991918,"put it this way, i shorted $twtr at $52 yesterday and just cashed out (yay) - as my theory is the deal won't go smoothly (i could launch into a conspiracy that he's just doing it to get the republicans on board before the mid terms / 2024 election - as he wants the government (sec / doj etc etc) off his back and hoping they come after him short term to terminate the deal - so he can claim the government are going after free speech and side further with the republicans and then get a pardon / run free for the 2024-2028 political environment)

if the deal falls - then musk says he's gonna sell his &lt;10% stake immediately - binary option - so that'll cause the shares to go back down to $35 ish (second disclosure: was long at $30-$40 and cashed out immediately when musk pumped to $50). 

since this is uk investing - fx is likely to play a factor here - so buying at $49 - if you get $54.20 - well if the fx goes from $1.26 today to say $1.33 when the deal closes (plausible) that cuts your return in half at least.

then just remember my two favourite rules:

* never bet on elon musk to follow through with anything.
* never bet against elon musk in the capital markets.

my favourite takeover risk/reward at the moment is actually $atvi - $msft buying at $95/share - currently just under $80/share.... so the markets are betting on that going through (regulatory risk) - personally i think that's more likely to go ahead (since who understands computer games anyway? few people play those) vs twitter.",10,,glosoli-,0

than learn how to set all that up and get into printing some cool things, 

---
my main goal for the 3d printer would be printing ball joint dolls (bjd) and to learn how to customize them.  

so buying packs of doll hair $25, and fabric $35 small bundle of colours, as well as a good sowing machine $150. making that $210 so say $300 if i go all out for misc accessories.  

i think they use watercolor pencils to draw on the face which is $40 or so but no idea if that's something you can do with 3d filament so i might have to buy some other paint pack.  
all that will be $350 leaving me with $7,230.

for my living room i would like a new couch and the ones i tend to like are about $650 let's say $750 if i buy couch pillows and other such things.  
i also need a new plug extension cord or two $20x2.  

because i don't have cable i would like a laptop to plug into my tv using the tv as a monitor. i'll say $400 for a good 2nd hand laptop so i can play retro pc games on it.  
leaving me with $6,035

while i'm living in an apartment i would love to replace the fridge $550 and stove i can't find average stove prices so i'll assume $1200 for a good upgrade.

1651041623,"mahayana buddha nature is not the same as non buddhist atman.

dzogchen teacher acarya malcolm smith:

here, the nirvana sutra clearly and precisely states that buddha-svabhaava, the ""nature of a buddha"" refers not to an actual nature but a potential. why, it continues:

""child of the lineage, i have said that ‘curd exists in milk’, because curd is produced from milk, it is called ‘curd’.

child of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there is no butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the curd arises from milk with the conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have the ‘curd-nature’.""

so one must be quite careful not to make an error. the lanka states unequivocably that the tathagatagarbha doctrine is merely a device to lead those who grasp at a true self the inner meaning of the dharma, non-arising, the two selflessnesses and so on, and explains the meaning of the literal examples some people constantly err about:

""similarly, that tathaagatagarbha taught in the suutras spoken by the bhagavan, since the completely pure luminous clear nature is completely pure from the beginning, possessing the thirty two marks, the bhagavan said it exists inside of the bodies of sentient beings.

when the bhagavan described that– like an extremely valuable jewel thoroughly wrapped in a soiled cloth, is thoroughly wrapped by cloth of the aggregates, aayatanas and elements, becoming impure by the conceptuality of the thorough conceptuality suppressed by the passion, anger and ignorance – as permanent, stable and eternal, how is the bhagavan’s teaching this as the tathaagatagarbha is not similar with as the assertion of self of the non-buddhists?

bhagavan, the non-buddhists make assertion a self as “a permanent creator, without qualities, pervasive and imperishable”.

the bhagavan replied:

“mahaamati, my teaching of tathaagatagarbha is not equivalent with the assertion of the self of the non-buddhists.

mahaamati, the tathaagata, arhat, samyak sambuddhas, having demonstrated the meaning of the words ""emptiness, reality limit, nirvana, non-arisen, signless"", etc. as tathaagatagarbha for the purpose of the immature complete forsaking the perishable abodes, demonstrate the expertiential range of the non-appearing abode of complete non-conceptuality by demonstrating the door of tathaagatagarbha.

mahaamati, a self should not be perceived as real by bodhisattva mahaasattvas enlightened in the future or presently.

mahaamati, for example, a potter, makes one mass of atoms of clay into various kinds containers from his hands, craft, a stick, thread and effort.

mahaamati, similarly, although tathaagatas avoid the nature of conceptual selflessness in dharmas, they also appropriately demonstrate tathaagatagarbha or demonstrate emptiness by various kinds [of demonstrations] possessing prajñaa and skillful means; like a potter, they demonstrate with various enumerations of words and letters. as such, because of that,

mahaamati, the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha is not similar with the self demonstrated by the non-buddhists.

mahaamati, the tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those grasping to assertions of the self of the non-buddhists, will demonstrate tathaagatagarbha with the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha. how else will the sentient beings who have fallen into a conceptual view of a true self, possess the thought to abide in the three liberations and quickly attain the complete manifestation of buddha in unsurpassed perfect, complete enlightenment?""

thus, the lanka says:

all yaanas are included
in five dharmas, three natures,
eight consciousnesses,
and two selflessnesses

it does not add anything about a true self and so on.

if one accepts that tathaagatagarbha is the aalayavij~naana, and one must since it is identified as such, then one is accepting that it is conditioned and afflicted and evolves, thus the lanka states:

tathaagatagarbha, known as ‘the all-base consciousness’, is to be completely purified.

mahaamati, if what is called the all-base consciousness were (37/a) not connected to the tathaagatagarbha, because the tathaagatagarbha would not be ‘the all-base consciousness’, although it would be not be engaged, it also would not evolve; mahaamati, it is engaged by both the childish and aaryas, that also evolves.

because great yogins, the ones not abandoning effort, abide with blissful conduct in this at the time of personally knowing for themselves…the tathaagatagarbha-all basis consciousness is the sphere of the tathaagatas; it is the object which also is the sphere of teachers, [those] of detailed and learned inclinations like you, and bodhisattva mahaasattvas of analytic intellect.

and:

although tathaagatagarbha
possesses seven consciousnesses;
always engaged with dualistic apprehensions
[it] will evolve with thorough understanding.


if one accepts that the tathaagatagarbha is unconditioned and so on, and one must, since it is identified as such other sutras state:

""`saariputra, the element of sentient beings denotes the word tathaagatagarbha.
`saariputra, that word ‘tathaagatagarbha’ denotes dharmakaaya.

and:

`saariputra, because of that, also the element of sentient beings is not one thing and the dharmakaaya another; the element of sentient beings itself is dharmakaaya; dharmakaaya itself is the element of sentient beings.

then one cannot accept it as the aalayavij~naana-- or worse, one must somehow imagine that something conditioned somehow becomes conditioned.

other sutras state that tathaagatagarbha is the citta, as the angulimaala suutra does here:

""although in the `sraavakayaana it is shown as ‘mind’, the meaning of the teaching is ‘tathaagatagarbha’; whatever mind is naturally pure, that is called ‘tathaagatagarbha’.

so, one must understand that these sutras are provisional and definitive, each giving different accounts of the tathaagatagarbha for different students, but they are not defintive. understood improperly, they lead one into a non-buddhist extremes. understood and explained properly, they lead those afraid of the profound praj~naapaaramitaa to understanding it's sublime truth. in other words, the buddha nature teaching is just a skillful means as the nirvana sutra states

""child of the lineage, buddha-nature is like this; although the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses, compassion, and the three foundations of mindfulness are the three aspects existing in sentient beings; [those] will be newly seen when defilements are thoroughly conquered. the possessors of perversion will newly attain the ten powers (44/b) and four fearlessness, great compassion and three foundations of mindfulness having thoroughly conquered perversion.

because that is the purpose as such, i teach buddha-nature always exists in all sentient beings.

when one can compare and contrast all of these citations, and many more side by side, with the proper reading of the uttataratantra, one will see the propositions about these doctrines by the dark zen fools and others of their ilk are dimmed like stars at noon.

1651066169,"[if you zoom way out you can see the reason the stock market has done so well the last twenty years is cause the economy has been doing worse and worse.   this has caused the federal reserve to print money in the form of qe and stimulus to prop all these asset classes up.   this is where the saying “don’t fight the fed” has come from. remember this saying.   so long as the fed is printing more new money and lowering interest rates then yes ride out any dips and bear markets, even buy those dips.   assets are really just someone else’s debt so the counter party risk is immense. it makes the system unravel if things start to crash.   they desperately don’t want that.   so rather than let things crash they have just printed new money, essentially loaning it to themselves.   this has caused asset inflation and that’s why the stock market and real estate have gone up so much.   but it’s also accelerated the breaking of this system. now it’s to the point where it’s starting to collapse.   casual investors don’t realize this quite yet.   it’s causing inflation so now the fed has to stop or they risk making inflation way way worse.   so now they have stopped printing new money, are letting treasuries roll off their balance sheet and also are raising interest rates.   all of these are bad for stocks. super bad that it’s all 3 at the same time.   but investors largely don’t remember a time before the fed was printing so it’s been a bull market for over a decade.   well don’t fight the fed. right?   well now they have stopped supporting these asset classes and now they will collapse.   stocks, real estate and bonds will all collapse. to a lesser degree so will commodities.   so what the smart money has done is slowly over 6-9 months sell high and trickled their money out slowly as to not shock the system and start the crash but snuck their money out.   they’re sitting in cash waiting to buy back in as well as investing in certain emerging markets, metals, mining stocks, commodities, futures.   at some point things will crash too much risking a bad recession (some think depression) and the fed will reverse course again and start to print massive amounts of money again.   that is when i’d be willing to get back in stocks if i’m looking for income rather than just investing long term. when they do the stock market will shoot up up up.   real estate is also in deep shit. it’s just a lot slower to feel the effects because it’s so much less liquid.   i sold all my rental properties in 2019.    the real long term play if you’re young and don’t need to draw off any of this as income is to buy and cold store bitcoin and ethereum.   that’s the new macro play and it’s the best asymmetrical bet i’ve ever seen. ever.   it’s still super early right now and i’d wager 99% of investors don’t understand it yet but it has an easy 100x growth play coming over the next two decades.   it’s how this broken inflationary system we live under right now will transition to a deflationary one and shore things up.   i sold over a million in apple stock and have it in cash.   i’ve still got $400k worth in there because i think it’s a blue chip that others will sell to buy for awhile still but i’ve got most of my money in bitcoin and ethereum and won’t sell any of that and i buy more every week.   i think soon most all the markets crash as the fear will keep building and building till people say fuck it no mas and dump.   i think bitcoin crashes right along with stocks and that is the dip i will buy up.   i’ve got buy orders set at 30k, 25k and 20k.   that’s how i see it. that’s my investment plan.   best of luck friend.](/r/stocks/comments/ubsfu2/twitter_halted_pending_news_bloomberg/i68ck3r/)

[competition in this space is so heavy because people who understand the revenue potential this sector has is immense. there's a reason why the biggest companies in the history of the world have all tried to enter this space. this is something microsoft, google, amazon, and apple all have in common - they've all tried to make a streaming os.    if you've ever used firetv for more than a few days you'd understand it's an ad-infested, unusable mess. the biggest threat i see to roku is actually googletv/android, both because they can leverage the power of youtube as well as the fact that they actually have a decent, scalable interface.   consolidation is inevitable - content providers are tired of wasting their money updating their app for 8 different os. i think streaming will be big enough to allow roku and googletv to both share a piece of the pie, along with those locked into amazon's os.](/r/stocks/comments/ubng5k/opinions_about_roku_down_80_why_is_it_dipping_and/i67c8q8/)

company a makes $10,000,000 net using ip and patents owned by company b. the licensing fee charged by company b is $10,000,000. company a now makes zero income, and paid zero us taxes. company b, being in abu dhabi, makes $10,000,000 and pays no taxes.

1651084082,"&gt; the unrealized gains themselves are not the source of the loans, the fact that loans can be taken off of stock without being a taxable event is the issue. millions of americans have stock in retirement and personal investing accounts while countless more own stock in their own businesses.

completely agree on this. i'd be happy making it so any stock used as collateral triggers a ""realized gains"" taxable event. i think that would go a long way to taxing billionaires the way they should while also not harming smaller investors.

&gt; are we going to force business owners (majority shareholders in their respective companies) to sell stock and divest themselves of the business they worked so hard to build just to cover the tax because the value of the company rose? it's insane.

to be clear, the kinds of percentages being talked about with ""wealth taxes"" would a.) have thresholds (i.e. no taxes below $1 billion in assets) and b.) be percentages that wouldn't be egregious, like 0.5-1%. combine these two factors, and a billionaire business owner (having 1 billion) would only have a tax bill of $1,000,000. i don't know many billionaires, but the ones i do know can pay that without issue.

&gt; i personally believe money invested by an individual in the market is doing more for our economy than money sitting under a mattress.

the money invested in the market doesn't do anything in the economy though. when you buy a stock, you're just giving someone else who holds the stock money. say it's an apple stock. when you apple stock on the market, you aren't buying it from apple, you're buying it from someone else. this is the case for any business listed, and additionally, for ipos as well. when a company ipos, they decide (with the help of an investment bank) what their valuation is, and how many shares they will distribute. however, it is not the company distributing these shares, it is actually the investment bank who has already bought and paid for all the stock the company is going to issue. so even in the case of ipos, you're still giving money only to an investment bank. not a single dollar in anyone's 401k has ever gone into the checkbook of an actual business that their stock represents.

&gt; who are you or anyone else to tell a 3rd party they suddenly and arbitrarily aren't allowed to reap success from their personal efforts?

well, i'm a member of society. society tells me to do a lot of things i would rather not do, but i do them anyway because i value being a member of society and think that there are a lot of benefits of remaining a member. but that isn't really the question. the question, i think, is how long should someone get to benefit from a personal venture, *even after they've stopped putting in any effort*. personally, i don't think it should be forever, but it's a position i've recently come to in my own head and i'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts.

&gt; but think of how amazon has changed the shopping world

i'm sure you've got your own thoughts on it, but when i see ""amazon changed the shopping world"" i see small mom and pop shops shut down because they can't compete. consumers who now demand that all their items be shipped in two days or less. rampant consumerism being incentivized that i feel is destroying the world. i see a lot of negatives that amazon has created to go along with their positives. it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

&gt; for the record personally...you specifically target billionaires' wealth and in the most ruthless...the us budget was $6.82 trillion last year...are there any projections on how much money this kind of policy (crunched the paragraph down to save some space)

and if i'm going to be completely honest, i don't even want this to fund the government. i simply want billionaires to be taxed the same way i am. i get money, i spend money, i get taxed. they get money, they spend money, but a lot of their money isn't taxed. i simply want to balance the scales. this isn't even a vendetta against billionaires for me, i simply think it's unfair.",1,,DeeJayGeezus,0
1651084247,"&gt; using your stock as collateral is not the same as selling your stock.

i'm glad you can read the tax code. i don't think anyone here is saying that that happens right now as part of the tax code. if they are they are dumb.

&gt; both parties are taking a calculated risk.

this risk is massively overstated. when's the last time microsoft stock tanked? apple? amazon? any of the big name, stable stocks? continuing the ponzi scheme of collateralizing loans with stock is probably the least risky venture any billionaire could take.",2,,DeeJayGeezus,0

1651098391,"greshm's law is a myth, for one thing. it's the idea that bad money drives out good, but really, it's just a matter of merchants or consumers having more leverage to dictate the terms of exchange.

what assets you want to save has little to do with what you will accept or use as payments.  let's say someone invested their entire portfolio in apple stock.  does that mean they would be more or less willing to accept the latter at the point of sale?

apple stock is not designed as a means of payment.  so even if an investor likes it, they aren't gonna accept it to sell t-shirts online. 

no matter what your portfolio looks like, you have to sell some to spend money.  if you can spend those assets directly, without having to sell them to a third party for other means of payment, that's just fewer steps.  so if anything, store of value is one factor of many that would encourage adoption as a means of payment.

the thing about cryptos, is they have a stable api, so once you program a website to accept them, you don't have to worry about changes or anything, or some terms of service change.  this stable api part is one of the most overlooked and compelling reasons to use cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for payment.  stripe can get bought out by a competitor, they can have their rules and terms of service changed.  while parts of the bitcoin protocol can change, it's designed to be stable and driven by consensus.",1,,crustycalzone,0

1651102533,"&gt;but the key here is that if zuckerberg wants to get any cash from meta, he will have to either sell his shares to other shareholders (and partially give up control) or have meta return capital to its shareholders. zuckerberg is in the same position as any other shareholder.

until you realise he could increase his renumeration! stock options/salary/kickbacks etc billion dollar renumeration packages do exist and quite frankly i don't think other shareholders would have much recourse on a 50%+ shareholder.

i'm mostly just being facetious, if he did do that, you would assume that no one would buy his shares and his value would drop dramatically (in theory). 

like other people have said, our whole society runs on ""trust"", trust that a dollar is worth something, bitcoin is an example.

if i have a meta stock, and by neighbour is willing to pay 10billion for my one stock? then that one stock is worth 10billion, to me.

nothing more, nothing less.

there are plenty of cases like you've noted with shitty companies run by maniacs who think they deserve millions for ""having ideas"" while they run the company into the ground. you'll also notice that a lot of those are penny stocks.

1651108440,"banks are difficult to understand and i'm really only beginning my journey, i think i understand enough for me,  but not enough to explain it well or answer detailed questions.   anyways:

fraternal reserve banking means banks can lend more money than they have, but they have to be able to pay out any reasonable demand. 

the amount held in reserves to pay out in the event of a bunch of people wanting to withdraw money is heavily regulated. 

different assets are assigned different weights,  a dollar cash counts as a dollar and so do short term treasuries.   stocks are weighted less, a dollar worth of even msft stock would only count as a quarter or less,  maybe even dime. 

as a result,  banks hold a lot of short term treasuries because they earn intrest and cash doesn't.   

intrest rates on short term treasuries have gone up rapidly so the mark to market value has gone down and banks have to maintain more capital. 

this limits buybacks in the near term,  but they weren't selling those bonds anyway. 

in the future,  as the old bonds mature and they are replaced with new higher yielding ones the banks are going to be making more money. 

i think right now is a great time to buy banks.   i just doubled my holdings of bk over the last two weeks and it's now my second largest holding.

1651113208,"you may understand programming, but you clearly do not understand finance. where crypto prices are entirely driven by hype, the stock market is not. stocks have actual underlying value in terms of part ownership of the company and all it is worth, voting rights, right to dividends, and more.

there is fundamental value there and as such a floor price - if the market was irrational for a day and everyone sold apple stock, the stock price would in the short term recover to said floor price. this means that market cap is a pretty reasonable metric for measuring total value. 

if the same happened in crypto, there is nothing but hype and fomo to stop it from driving all the way to zero and staying there. as a consequence, market cap is an exceedingly poor metric for measuring total value of the crypto market - liquidity is far more important. 

btw, daily trade volume is a poor metric for measuring stock liquidity and crypto liquidity - see the discussion above to help see why. especially for crytpo, the daily trade volume metric is also inflated by both movement of money (non transactional) and flat out fake trading volume https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-and-why-crypto-exchanges-fake-trading-volumes-2021-08-24",15,,PensAndCoffee,0

when i was 15 i inherited $10k from my grandmother. i asked to put it in a brokerage account and invest 100% of it in apple stock. this was 2005. when i asked my dad about selling some in 2012 i was told it was “gone.” turns out he sold it all within a few weeks, but managed to buy himself a $2 million house shortly after. the stock would be worth about $500k now. i think about it every day as i struggle to make ends meet. 

turns out, my parents didn’t save anything for retirement either despite at one point making over $2 million per year. just spent every penny on wine, trips and various other fleeting luxuries. now they’re in their 70s and my dad is still desperate to work because they have no idea how they’re going to afford to live another 20 or so years - but they do have about 1,000 bottles of ridiculous expensive wine that tastes like shit.

the kicker: they blame their current struggles on the fact that they had kids. if only we didn’t require food and shelter! it wasn’t the maserati or the multiple porsches or the semi annual first class trips to europe. it was me. perpetual victims of some cosmic injustice despite having the easiest life imaginable until their own lack of foresight came around to bite them.",30,,SalamandersonCooper,0

[banks are difficult to understand and i'm really only beginning my journey, i think i understand enough for me,  but not enough to explain it well or answer detailed questions.   anyways:  fraternal reserve banking means banks can lend more money than they have, but they have to be able to pay out any reasonable demand.   the amount held in reserves to pay out in the event of a bunch of people wanting to withdraw money is heavily regulated.   different assets are assigned different weights,  a dollar cash counts as a dollar and so do short term treasuries.   stocks are weighted less, a dollar worth of even msft stock would only count as a quarter or less,  maybe even dime.   as a result,  banks hold a lot of short term treasuries because they earn intrest and cash doesn't.     intrest rates on short term treasuries have gone up rapidly so the mark to market value has gone down and banks have to maintain more capital.   this limits buybacks in the near term,  but they weren't selling those bonds anyway.   in the future,  as the old bonds mature and they are replaced with new higher yielding ones the banks are going to be making more money.   i think right now is a great time to buy banks.   i just doubled my holdings of bk over the last two weeks and it's now my second largest holding.   good luck.](/r/stocks/comments/udgxb9/whats_going_on_with_financial_stocks_like_bac_and/i6h6hz0/)

[a lot of amateur traders seem to think that trading involves having a crystal ball and predicting exact prices with certainty.  successful traders know that trading is a series of if/then statements.  you work algorithmically.  if price drops to x, buy looking for y.  if price rises to z, short looking for a.  you don't go full on conviction of ""i am sure price is going to go to b, therefore i will all in on this trade because i'm certain of it"".  that's how you get wrecked.  you can always pick a novice out by their attitude regarding these if/then predictions, because they're convinced there is only one right answer and you should be able to know what it is.  truth is, nobody knows.  the best traders in the world don't know.  they work on probabilities.  also, hilariously, op was spot on.  nas dropped almost exactly 700 points today.](/r/daytrading/comments/ucdxp4/if_alphabets_earnings_disappoint_nasdaq_could/i6beofo/)

looking at cloud growth of 43%, search at 27%, services at 20%, other bets at 120% (small portion but impressive still), they are growing fast still and i think it’s cheap considering the low multiples across the board compared to the past averages and continuing growth. it’s not really a value stock, but it is attractive as a reasonably priced growth stock.

1651206789,"1. the period is pretty long usually at least a year. basically they don't want to drive up the share price by buying in a short time or have people front running them. also there are rules to make sure the company doesn't buy it too fast pumping the shares. if for example a company tried to buy back billions of dollars in a day the buying pressure may increase the stock price. i believe the buy backs cannot exceed 25% of the daily volume of the stock.

2\3 are kind of the same question. yes they work with a brokerage and have flexibly on when to do this. i don't think they will have a set schedule like ""buy 5 million a day for 20 days""

also yes sometimes they work with an investment bank and basically give them 10 billion , the investment bank has a set time period to buy the shares, then at the end the bank hands over the shares they bought back to the company.

note the investment bank may setup some bock trades . lets say apple wants to buy back 10 billion of its own stock. it hands this to an investment bank (say goldman) . lets say berkshire who owns tons of apple stock needs to sell because apple now account for 23% of its holdings and it doesn't want to be exposed to a single stock over 20% so it needs to sell to trim its holdings back down to 20%.

berkshire may not want to just start selling large amounts through the exchanges, first selling large amounts may start lowering the price. second if people figure out berkshire is selling the news may drop the stock.

well goldman can now step in and say "" hey you looking to sell a few billion of apple, guess what we have a buyer looking to buy a few billion of apple "" and both buyer and seller can get a better price without moving the price by making this deal and not going through the exchanges.",2,,SirGlass,0

1651219431,"i think of the ""mary sue"" character being a kind of meta stock character or archetype. some stories that embrace it, either satirically or not, can get away with it if done right. one-punch man is essentially an anime superhero mary sue, but since the entire concept revolves around world-ending threats that end up trivially defeated by a single punch from the mc, and the whole story builds up to that and the point is to subvert traditional tropes in a comically underwhelming way, it works.

other mary sues are used as resource. they are supremely powerful or competent, but the scope of story means that while they can be used to swing any battle, you can't win every battle with them. gandalf can be seen as this kind of mary sue. gandalf isn't a boring, overpowered character because he can essentially only be in one place at a time, and even if he's worth a hundred other characters, you'd need a thousand to win.

the ops point that a mary sue is a story issue, not a character issue, is right in the sense that if you have story that doesn't accommodate a mary sue, you'll always end up in a situation where the mary sue trivializes the problem. however, that's largely a question of framing the issue. a story that doesn't fit the characters portrayed can also be framed as a character not fitting the story being told.

but that line of thinking glosses over the possibility of a character simply being written badly. yes, the supreme fisherman who happens to be able to solve every issue with his fishing skills is a story issue, but there are actual, horribly written mary sues that are horrible characters. the classic example is the quintessential fanfic self-insert, who is simply unable to do anything wrong. they are one-dimensional. there's no conflict and no stake since the character is unable to be compromised in any way. just like the damsel in distress who has no agency and is only the medal at the end for the protagonist, a mary sue stock character written badly doesn't impact the plot meaningfully. a good litmus test for this kind of character is ""could this have gone any other way"", and if the answer is that the result was never in question, you have a badly written character.

a lot of the mary sue criticism isn't that the character is a full-blown mary sue, but that they exhibit mary sue-ish traits in a detrimental way. rand al'thor isn't a mary sue by a long shot, but some of what he does and how he interacts do bring to mind the mary sue trope. when people criticize rand is a mary sue, it doesn't mean he fulfills every facet of the character type, but that some of his actions and interactions are very self-insert-y and idealized in a way that is a detriment to the story.",5,,Nibaa,0

yes arguments from bith sides. this is how science works. but till we get a better explaination for this the emh is still useful. well whats youe model? also, i brought up ff5 because you asked me what my model is. 

a market is called efficient when prices reflect all publicly known information. this is the emh. nothing more and nothing less. and ofc future stock prices will not be known. but that does not mean that prices dont contain any information. stocks have future growth priced into them because current growth is known. to add to that: yes, they cant know the future growth. but because the past growth is know the prices will reflect the markets expectations  for future growth. so if you want to buy apple stock and wish for insane returns like they did last decade,  apple has to have the same growth. i really dont know why you do not understand this. why do you think a stock price falls when the expected profit is not met?

you really do not understand the emh. it does not say everything has to be priced the same. it just says that current stock prices reflect the known information. so there could be value and growth stocks under the emh. please make an argument against that. spoiler: you cant. also, the guy who got a nobel prize for the emh also made the ff3 model where small cap value stocks outperform large cap growth stocks. btw i never said that stocks are undervalued or overvalued. i do not have any reason to believe stocks are systematically under/overvalued. value stocks tend to be more risky, thus you get compensated for it. easy as that.

very nice! 

well many politicians are straight up bad at their job. and they get payed more then they deserve. but also, saying you get payed much or other stuff like this isnt an argument.

what do you mean? you saying the emh is not a theory? it is literally a theory. it fits the definition of a theory perfectly. 

and again, just naming stuff again. ofc a degree in this field is import and all. but you have to support what you claim with data and theory. also, many phds can be wrong. like this is not relevant. you are arguing against some people who have authored many landmark papers in finace, got a nobel prize for it and are cited by thousands of new papers. they work with hundreds of phds and even more. so i do believe them more then the ""i make 750k a years, make 30% annually"" guy. 

but to end this. what is wrong with my points? the first post i made talked about the already high expectations the market has on the companies in qqq. so i argued that that it isnt realistic to think that you will get the same returns as last decade. please prove me wrong.

secondly, you said some random stuff about investing in tech innovation. where do you get this from? this is literally against all the data we have so far. investing in a good company does not make it a good investment. this is seen by ""old"" sectors outperforming ""newer"" ones.

lastly, i argued that the emh is probably the best model we have so far. and i am saying that everyone should invest as if it were true (pretty uncontroversial take lmao). please do enlighten me as to why this is not the case.",1,,AssEater70,0

1651327564,"hard truths: 

1) a lot of indv stocks might not get back to their highs for years or decades if ever. 

2) big stock runs rarely happen to the biggest names in a sector, bigger returns happen from lesser known names. 

3) it's a long term position, i don't have risk:

the longer you hold the wider the range of outcomes. including massive losses. ask @cathiedwood. 

opportunity cost is often ignored. you could own stocks in uptrends but your ego stops you from cutting losses &amp; shifting exposure.

4) the stock is better now that it's ""cheaper"": 

when a stock breaks down on heavy volume it's a warning sign.

once a stock enters its stage 4 downtrend by breaking below its 30 week ma it should be avoided like the plague.

1651334739,"if it was a planned process, it'd be ridiculously easy. you'd map it out, find someone to make friends with then make a straw men bet at like a track on some insane pay off horse race, tell the guy ""hey if this hits, give me 10% of it"" and then you take the money research unsavory types and buy fake ids. the book replay goes in to this where the guy finds places to make illegal bets, and has to be careful to make sure they're not ""too"" good and arouse suspicion.

then with your own id you can place those same bets and winnings and then you're just some guy who got really rich through betting and your life is essentially above board.

if it's not a planned process, i.e. something like the time traveler's wife. things would be a little different. you'd likely have to steal initially to get walking around money, find someone who trusts you and then get them to let you live off credit til the first ""sure thing"" you remember occurs.

for me, if i was reliving my life, the only sure things i can remember off hand are the 1985 bears superbowl which paid off 10:1 if you picked them to win at the beginning of the season. so let's say i got back to like 1984, live off couches or homeless shelters til i find someone who's willing to make a $10,000 bet, then convince them to give me a portion of it. the next one i remember is buster douglas beating tyson in 1990 and that paid 40:1. 

at that point i'd be able to pay for really good forgeries and then live off bank loans and credit cards.

from there i'd likely use the stock market. microsoft stock pre windows 95 was relatively cheap and then skyrocketed, repeat the process in 2000 with apple before the ipod, then in 2008 invest in bitcoin. at that point you'd become a billionaire.

i think there's an interesting story there of a time traveler waiting for that first sure thing to hit and you're living off insane credit, like having 12 credit cards with enormous debt, hiding from debt collectors etc. you have this supreme confidence to know everything's going to work out, but in the meantime you're insanely underwater. like $100,000 in debt with monthly $10,000 credit bills, but you're just like ""nah man, it's all good.""",2,,supergooduser,0
1651337229,"reading through the nvda 10-k, jumped to the section of the vote on neo compensation. this little bit stood out to me on the **'what we don't do'** box in their compensation philosophy breakdown:

&gt;- permit executive officers, employees or directors to 
hedge their ownership of nvidia stock or to pledge 
nvidia stock as collateral for a loan

pretty relevant given recent developments lol. 

besides that, first time flipping through a 10-k. nvda is my biggest holding so i thought i owed it to myself to read up on what the company is doing. holy shit, i'm actually even *more* stoked about the future of this company. yeah, it's going through the shitter now like every other semi company, but i'm looking like 10 years+ down the road, and the stuff they're doing *right now* is fucking crazy.

omniverse digital copies?? bleeding edge ai research, at the forefront of the field? crazy ass shit! i thought i was invested in a graphics card company. these guys are **the fucking future.**",3,,atm0,0

should nvidia fail yo deliver, the stock will go ka-boom just like netflix's did. i'm not saying whether it will happen, but should nvidia stock plummet - very few will be surprised.

amd, qualcomm, broadcom and many other semiconductor stocks are priced much closer to the fundamentals.",15,,Gobra_Slo,0

he purchased apple stock for the buy backs (from the large cash pile of apples treasury).
but generally warren does not like technology investments (as he has stated on multiple occasions).

is this a plan by microsoft's board of directors to insert into this merger with a ""familiar face""?

why leak this purchase to the press? warren offers alot of legitimacy to something that  could be rejected by government antitrust regulators.",19,,DYTTIGAF,0

it sounds like we should be taking investing advice from *you*, not the other way around lol.

if you like the same tech secular, safe as bank stocks as apple, then i would go into microsoft, google, qualcomm mostly, and a sprinkle of amd, marvell, and meta.

instead of straight up selling your apple stock, maybe you can sell some calls on the portion you wanted to sell anyway.",6,,r2002,0
