The company recently announced they are teaming up with Microsoft to build an AI cloud computer, which is helping further the businesses' vision for computing overall.  Out of the top ten supercomputers in the world, NVIDIA has created five of them.  

Add to this the growing markets for the company in the autonomous vehicle space as well as with data centers, the future looks bright for NVIDIA and its stock.  The current downtrend in the stock reflects investors' hesitancy with the current consumer market headwinds, but this trend seems temporary.

While its stock price, including those of many other tech names, has been falling this year, it may be a great opportunity to purchase shares in an outstanding company.  

Microsoft's dividend is small at just around a 1% yield, but it has been growing this dividend at around 11% annually, in addition to consistently reducing its share count through buybacks.  What's more, the growth story of this company is far from over.  

Even with nearly $200 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year, its largest segments of cloud software and productivity subscriptions, are growing fast.  This has led the company overall to make 18% more revenue in the past year.  Add to this high growth segments like LinkedIn (revenue up 35% year over year), and you have a recipe for an even more powerful and profitable technology business.

1671197623,5 reasons why meta stock just caught a rare upgrade,"Meta's stock has had a disastrous year in large part because the underlying company has had a disastrous year headlined by sweeping layoffs, weakening ad sales, and poor execution by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

But the stock caught one believer on Friday finally headed into the New Year.

""Heading into 2023, we believe some of these top and bottom line pressures will ease, and most importantly, Meta is showing encouraging signs of increasing cost discipline, we believe with more to come,"" said JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a new client note.

Anmuth lifted his rating to overweight (out-perform equivalent) from neutral. He sees fair value for Meta at $150, up from $115 previously.

Meta shares rose 1.5% to $117 in pre-market trading. The stock has crashed about 65% year to date, making the worst-performing component of the closely tracked FAANG (Meta/Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex.

Here are the five drivers of Anmuth's Meta upgrade:

**1)** Better cost controls by management on both total expenses and capital expenditures.

**2)** Lessening sales impact from Apple iOS privacy changes.

**3)** The company stands to compete more effectively against surging rival TikTok.

**4)** Reels monetization may gain steam and become ""at least"" neutral to sales in later 2023.

**5)** Valuation on the stock is ""compelling"" after the steep 2022 drop.

1671598491,"why apple stock is outperforming other tech stocks like amazon, meta, and meta","In recent months, Apple has suffered one setback after another. Apple is anticipated to lose out on the sale of millions of iPhones this holiday season, which is the company's most crucial period of the year, due to labour unrest and production halts at Foxconn Technology Group's enormous iPhone plant in central China.

The majority of economists believe that a worldwide recession will start up in the next year, which will decrease consumer demand for the pricey products that Apple offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Technology companies have particularly lost popularity as central banks quickly boost interest rates to control inflation. Apple stock has lost close to $800 billion this year, or roughly one-fourth of its market worth.

In the meantime, Apple's App Store policies are coming under more antitrust investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Bloomberg News, the corporation is getting ready for the severe EU regulations that will take effect in 2024 by allowing apps from other sources to run on its iPhones and iPads.

&amp;#x200B;

That development would encourage the US and other nations to adopt similar policies as the EU, endangering the $23 billion in revenue experts predict the App Store will bring in for the company during its current fiscal year, which ends in September.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that is bad news. And yet, as of Dec. 16, Apple is significantly outperforming rival tech behemoths whose shares have plummeted this year on the stock market.

[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. has decreased by 47%, Meta Platforms Inc. has lost 64% of its value, and Apple has decreased by 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

With its enormous earnings as a starting point, Apple's performance can be explained.

&amp;#x200B;

With a market value of $2.1 trillion, Apple is the most valuable corporation in the world, therefore it should come as no surprise that it generates more profit than any other S&amp;P 500 company.

&amp;#x200B;

What it does with those earnings is where it really stands out in the eyes of investors.

&amp;#x200B;

The corporation has generated $454 billion in cash from operations during the last five years. Apple has returned all of that moneyâ€”and then someâ€”to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks rather than investing those revenues in the purchases of prestigious firms.

That is greater than the market worth of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or Exxon Mobil Corp. Apple opted not to respond.

The founder and chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners LLC, an asset management firm that owns Apple shares, Kimberly Forrest, claims that Apple could have done everything that the bankers wanted them to doâ€”buy Netflix and Disney. Instead, they exercised restraint, gave back funds to shareholders, and were rewarded as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Expectations for Apple's future profitability also contribute to the stock's robust performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Although Wall Street experts anticipate a 2% increase in Apple's profit in 2023, 2023 earnings predictions for the IT industry have been declining.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, combined earnings for tech companies in the S&amp;P 500 are anticipated to decline by about 2%.

&amp;#x200B;

Another element is the devoted following of Apple customers.

&amp;#x200B;

More than a billion iPhones are in use, and many users also own iPads, Mac laptops, and watches, among other items from the Apple family.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple has what is referred to as a ""sticky"" platform when combined with an expanding number of services, such as cloud storage and apps linked to those devices.

Apple's App Store practises resulted in a court in Paris fining the company more than EUR 1 million.

According to Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group LLC, which owns Apple shares, ""it's hard to unplug yourself if you've acquired a number of Apple goods and services, and they all operate together.""

&amp;#x200B;

Because they can't get an iPhone this month, many don't switch to Android. They will wait one month. There won't be any change in such conduct.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Benowitz, Apple has also profited from predictions that its wealthy clients will be better able to continue purchasing its products even during a recession.

These presumptions are being examined. According to Bloomberg News, Foxconn's Zhengzhou assembly plant's worker unrest will probably cause a production shortfall of close to 6 million iPhone Pro units this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Others are even more negative; Ming-Chi Kuo, a well-known analyst at TF International Securities Group Ltd., forecasted that Apple may run out of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max handsets in the holiday quarter by as many as 20 million units.

&amp;#x200B;

He also cautioned that a slowing economy could result in a decline in demand for the devices, which can cost up to $1,599.

On December 15, Foxconn announced that most anti-Covid-19 rules at its Zhengzhou factory, where the majority of iPhone Pro devices are put together, are being relaxed.

&amp;#x200B;

The corporation had forced employees to spend weeks living in isolation with inadequate food rations in order to stop a Covid outbreak and maintain production, sparking violent protests.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Foxconn, labour unrest has been ""taken under control"" and the factory is progressively returning to regular production capacity.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the abrupt change in China's Covid Zero policies could result in an increase in hospital admissions and cases, causing further additional disruptions.

Apple has detractors. The Baron Opportunity Fund's vice president and portfolio manager, Michael Lippert, sees an overvalued IT giant whose days of explosive expansion and ground-breaking inventions are finished.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the invention of the iPhone, when has there been a truly spectacular innovation? Lippert queries. With each new release, ""it simply gets a little bit better,"" he claims.
