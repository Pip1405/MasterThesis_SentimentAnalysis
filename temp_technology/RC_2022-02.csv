1643704673,"- the configuration system for php is an absolute nightmare, and knowing exactly how it works requires a serious amount of documentation memorization    
- php has a loooong history of terrible security, more so than literally any other language  
- the naming of standard functions seems completely arbitrary (`bin2hex` , `strtolower`, `str_replace` etc)  
- the standard library has _a lot_ of extremely surprising behavior, like for instance `date_parse` by _default_ will assume current time for values not specified. `json_decode` will return `null` on parse error even though `null` is also acceptable json    
- the truth-table looks like it was created by a [white-noise generator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php)  
- string conversions will not consistently produce text for display (true = ""1"", false = """") because whether they focus their ""features"" on amateurs or what's actually useful is completely arbitrary. they can't seem to make up their mind on whether string conversions should do the same in reverse or not  
- php still does not natively support unicode (if you by mistake save a file using utf-16 encoding, php will vomit out all of your source code)  
- modules in php are a nightmare, especially on windows. is it built-in? yes, no? well you better check  
- it's so difficult to get working correctly ""vanilla"" that most people use custom installers they find around. oh you're unaware? well, try installing a web site someone else has made and get it working the first time. almost literally impossible    
- php has a dizzying array of different ways of handling errors, which error handling mechanism you have to use depends on what functions you are calling. some return an error value, some set an error state, some have their own error handlers, and some throw exceptions    
- some language design decisions are made not because they make sense, but because they want the language to look different. why use `::` for namespaces when you can use `\\` while ignoring the fact that `\` is an escape character making it a problematic choice for string interpolation (and windows paths i guess)  
- rasmus lerdorf argued in ""favor"" of memory leaks because it was just [so easy to restart the web server instead](https://medium.com/@wordcorpglobal/programming-doesnt-require-talent-or-even-passion-11422270e1e4)    
- some keywords are magic, like `(int)`, because `int` is not a keyword. so what's `(int)`? a special hardcoded syntax that has nothing to do with anything else  
- how and whether a function works is dependent on a lot of things, including my first point; configuration. it might also be compiled in such a way that certain function will simply just not do anything. you just have to know about it.   
- php used to have the strangest operator of all languages, the null cast operator. what does it do? it returns null. well, it supposedly _casts_ a value to null. the value itself is unchanged. `$v = (unset)$value` is the exact same thing as `$v = null` so what does it do really? absolutely bizarre   
- when looking at the documentation for php, __you have to read the comments as well__. there are tons of gotchas that are either poorly documented or not documented at all, and you need to read the comments to discover them

i'd like to hear someone make some solid technical arguments in favor of actually using php over literally anything else, because i honestly don't think there are any.  (""i like it"", or ""i'm productive in it"" isn't a good reason, you're an engineer not a dabbler in desserts. if you're unproductive in other things it's because you are inexperienced, not because there's something inherently ""productive"" about php)",4,,intbeam,0

[the best way i can describe salesforce...is that its ecosystem feels like an mlm. it's obviously not, but engaging with salesforce community feels almost cult-like. i feel like that's exactly what you want from your userbase. also, their whole trailhead system is mind blowing. you can learn so much about salesforce in an easy, structured manner without spending a dime - they just outright give you development environments to learn with (including teaching you premium features, so you can be better prepped to make your company purchase them). by making it so easy for someone to learn the nuts and bolts of salesforce, it incentivizes people to spread the gospel within their employers.  my biggest concern regarding salesforce is that it's extremely expensive.  obviously there are no technicals in this post, so do with this info what you will. i do not hold any positions in crm, but if i had enough money to diversify in tech beyond just msft and aapl then crm would be near the top of my list.](/r/stocks/comments/sg1kq8/what_are_your_thoughts_about_salesforce_crm/huw4t0d/)

[how i envision it, when ad revenue model gets introduced, subscribers start to leave to avoid any ads, then the loss in sub revenue puts pressure to increase ad revenue, increased ad revenue gives advertisers more bargaining power, so naturally they will want to either get more time slots on the platform for the most popular content. so nflx will either have to gut ad revenue at that point to protect content and viewer experience (and ultimately lose out because they would've already lost subscribers a lot of subscribers) or they'll have to bow to advertisers and force loyal subscribers to pay more to avoid ads, which will further decrease subscriptions. ultimately with less subscribers, advertisers will have more say in what content nflx should produce. ad revenue would likely not overtake sub revenue but the priority will likely be placed on ad revenue as a means of better finances to report to shareholders. imo it'll destroy the business and increase their need for external financing to operate. nflx does its best work when they now to no-one except their subscribers which has always been their focus and it has done well for them over the years. it's because of this model that they can play around in other spaces like gaming without having any negative impact to their budget.](/r/stocks/comments/sflbzi/next_weeks_earnings/hussg4b/)

congress resembled a wall street trading desk last year, with lawmakers making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades, buying and selling shares of companies based in the u.s. and around the world.

at least 113 lawmakers have disclosed stock transactions that were made in 2021 by themselves or family members, according to a capitol trades analysis of disclosures and marketwatch reporting. u.s. lawmakers bought an estimated $180 million worth of stock last year and sold $175 million.

the trading action taking place in both the house and the senate comes as some lawmakers push for a ban on congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. stock trading is a bipartisan activity in washington, widely conducted by both democrats and republicans, the disclosures show. congress as a whole tended to be slightly bullish last year with more buys than sells as the s&amp;p 500 spx soared and returned 28.4%. republicans traded a larger dollar amount overall — an estimated $201 million vs. democrats’ $154 million.

so who were the biggest traders? the table below, based on a capitol trades analysis, shows the 41 members of congress who made stock buys or sells in 2021 with an estimated value of at least $500,000 — or had family members who made such trades.

at the top of the list of the biggest traders on capitol hill by dollar volume is rep. michael mccaul, a texas republican, who disclosed an estimated $31 million in stock buys and $35 million in stock sales. he’s followed by democratic rep. ro khanna of california with $34 million in estimated purchases and $19 million in sales, gop rep. mark green of tennessee with $26 million in estimated buys and $26 million in sells, and democratic rep. suzan delbene of washington state with $15 million in estimated buys and $31 million in sells.

source: capitol trades analysis of disclosures filed from early 2021 through mid-january 2022 covering stock trades made in 2021, as well as marketwatch reporting

* rep. franklin’s disclosures show $53 million in stock sales, but his office says a filing for a $50 million sale isn’t correct. so that would make his estimated amount transacted about $3 million.

congress’s more than 500 members are required to file disclosures within 45 days for any transactions involving stocks and other securities due to 2012’s stock act, though many lawmakers have been late with their filings. the decade-old law, which aims to help prevent politicians from profiting from nonpublic information, is viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups, especially given how a divided washington united to weaken the law in 2013 by removing provisions such as one that required putting the disclosures in a searchable database.

independent analysis firms have ended up offering such databases, with 2iq research, for example, launching capitol trades last year. for the table above, capitol trades estimated the value of buys and sells using the midpoint of the declared range for the transaction. lawmakers aren’t required to disclose a transaction’s exact value, but rather give ranges such as $1,001 to $15,000, or $15,001 to $50,000.

mccaul’s biggest disclosed trades in 2021 include sales by a child and his spouse of shares in cullen/frost bankers cfr, a bank headquartered in mccaul’s state, as well as sales by his spouse of shares of china’s tencent holdings tcehy, according to filings aggregated by capitol trades. the texas congressman’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. his father-in-law is the founder of media giant clear channel, now known as iheartmedia ihrt, and mccaul has ranked as one of the wealthiest u.s. lawmakers.

khanna’s biggest trades included purchases by his spouse of shares in walgreens boots alliance wba and microsoft msft, along with purchases by a child of shares in apple aapl, communications company ringcentral rng and facebook parent meta platforms fb. the california congressman’s spokeswoman said he “does not own any individual stocks and complies fully with the ban conflicted trading act, which would prohibit lawmakers from buying or selling individual stocks.” that’s a reference to legislation that has attracted 35 co-sponsors in the house and three in the senate.

“these are his wife’s assets prior to marriage and managed by an outside financial advisor. no trading is done through joint accounts,” khanna’s spokeswoman also said.

while khanna’s 2021 disclosures put him at no. 2 behind mccaul for biggest trader in congress by dollar volume, capitol trades ranks him at no. 1 when going by his disclosed number of trades, which was 3,555.

green’s largest trades included sales and a purchase of shares in shell midstream partners shlx, an oil pipelines company, along with sales of shares in motor-fuels distributor crossamerica partners capl and a purchase of shares in antero midstream am, another pipelines company. in response to a marketwatch request for comment, a spokeswoman for the tennessee congressman pointed to his remarks in a recent fox business interview.

“i let a manager handle it,” green said in that interview, when asked about efforts to ban lawmakers from trading in individual stocks. “i’ve written it into a letter: ‘do not take any instructions from me. don’t listen to me on television and make any decisions.’ and i let him make all of the decisions. i’m for people doing it that way.”

he also said “getting insider information is a crime,” and laws against it “should be enforced.”

why are people willing to assign value to picasso’s paintings? beauty, perspective, history, story. there i “looked into someone’s mind”

1643790076,"i see, i think this seems reasonable. if we accept that probability as roughly accurate, then you have a small positive expected value. premiums (and therefore iv) are elevated right now due to the uncertainty and big swings in the broader markets. whatever thesis you have specifically for $nvda might be completely right, but there's an elevated risk that the macro drivers of the broader market will dominate over all other factors moving the stock price, as they have this past month, and in an unfavorable way. 

with low iv underlyings, there's often not enough premium to justify the risk/reward trade-off (even when iv rank/percentile is high), as you saw with the poor profit/loss ratios you cited. different people have different trading strategies, but from my perspective, there's a comfortable range of iv where you can get enough premium for decent risk/reward, without veering too far into crazy high iv where underlying prices are totally unpredictable.

it's fine to use probability of profit numbers as an input into your trading decisions, e.g. sense checking that a spread is priced roughly appropriately, and if not, it may be an indicator that the market is anticipating something that you're not considering. just be aware that these probability of profit numbers can never be precise.",1,,hhh1001,0

[just read this:  ""one of the most important metrics for judging a company's financial position is its **eps.** **eps divides a company's total earnings by the number of outstanding shares; a higher number indicates a stronger financial position**.**by repurchasing its stock, a company decreases the number of outstanding shares. a stock buyback thus enables a company to increase this metric without actually increasing its earnings or doing anything to support the idea that it is becoming financially stronger.**as an illustration, consider a company with yearly earnings of $10 million and 500,000 outstanding shares. this company's eps, then, is $20. if it repurchases 100,000 of its outstanding shares, its eps immediately increases to $25, even though its earnings have not budged. investors who use eps to gauge financial position may view this company as stronger than a similar firm with an eps of $20 when in reality the use of the buyback tactic accounts for the $5 difference.the impact on earnings per share can give an **artificial lift to the stock and mask financial problems that would be revealed by a closer look at the company’s ratios**.  **buybacks can create a short-term bump in the stock price that some say allows insiders to profit while suckering other investors. this price increase may look good at first, but the positive effect is usually ephemeral, with equilibrium regaining when the market realizes that the company has done nothing to increase its actual value**. those who buy in after the bump can then lose money.  and, as mentioned above, any boost to share price from the buyback seems to be short-lived. along with apple, exxon mobil, and ibm have made significant share repurchases. a cnbc article in may 2017 said since the turn of the century, total outstanding shares of exxon mobil have fallen 40%, and ibm's has decreased by a whopping 60% from its peak in 1995. the article notes that not only does this fit ""financial engineering,"" but it also affects overall stock indexes that are valued on the weightings in these companies.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/si2fxh/so_i_was_wrong/hv73gfi/)

1643820560,"the answer is within the question itself, ""google"" it  


here ya go - goog and googl are stock ticker symbols for alphabet (the company formerly known as google). the main difference between the goog and googl stock ticker symbols is that goog shares have no voting rights while googl shares do. the company created two classes of shares in april 2014. the reason for the split between the two classes of shares was to preserve the control of founders larry page and sergey brin. when companies go public, founders often lose control of their company when too many shares are issued.  


c class tends to be cheaper due to lack of voting rights",2,,Dxtuned,0

1643821338,"i keep seeing this but it really isn't that implausible.

if you know you are committing a crime or breaking a rule, you would probably do a good job of covering your tracks. not always mind you. 

there are numerous cases of insider trading and other financial crimes that were well-documented in emails or instant messaging clients. these are mostly ivy-league graduates working with huge sums of money and documenting their crimes thoroughly for the sec. [arthur samberg with microsoft stock is one example](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-pequot-idustre64q4a020100527). 

[another good one is this $40m fraud case](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/secs-mind-boggling-tale-40-million-fraud-class-action-administrators-2021-11-04/). the best part is when one of the defendants emails the other the following:

&gt; “i woke up in the middle of the night thinking about jail, because we waited a week to hear anything from the admin.”

sometimes they get ""clever"" and don't use the word bribe. they replace it with chickens. [i kid you not](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-04/don-t-call-bribes-chickens?cmpid=bbd102021_moneystuff&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=211020&amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff).

&gt; fine brother. i have consulted and please put 50 million chickens. whatever numbers you have on your poultry i will add 50 million of my breed.

so even if you know it's a crime, you still might document it.

but what if you didn't know it's a crime? what if you didn't know you broke a rule? what if you were so unaware that you didn't think it mattered?

you wouldn't bother to cover anything up. you wouldn't think it even needed to be covered up.

and to me, this is the most plausible option. i'm not saying this happened, but that if there is evidence, it's because ross didn't even think it was a big deal.

and really, are we surprised?

every time a team trades away a big star, we all accuse them of tanking. teams in other sports absolutely do tank. so would ross really think it's a big deal to actually legitimately say the quiet part out loud?

i'm not sure if flores does have proof or not. but i am fairly certain that ross does not deserve the benefit of the doubt that he's smart enough to not document this shit. he has no clue what the fuck he's doing with this football team. i absolutely could see him not knowing you shouldn't talk about it out loud or document it.",14,,polkarooo,0

as for bear sterns, i rewatched the video and okay, you're right. in that video, he meant not to take money out of your account at bear sterns. however, 5 days prior to that, he was bullish on bear when it was at $69 and earlier than that on jan 24, 2008, he was telling people to buy bear stearns stock, when it was at $87.",1,,webulltrade,0

1643836271,"right.  well, this is always tricky, when we deal with a spreadsheet primarily setup for data entry, but not so great for data aggregation.  that being said, it can be done, but it's *messy.*

when dealing with stuff in this format, you want to consolidate your multiple columns into one -- this is the issue you ran into with the unique function.  i suggest using the flatten function which takes a bunch of columns and, well, *flattens*, them into one.  wrap that flatten function in a query to eliminate blank rows, and finally wrap everything in a unique function like this:

    =unique(query(flatten(d2:d,f2:f,h2:h,j2:j,l2:l,n2:n,p2:p,r2:r,t2:t,v2:v,x2:x,z2:z),""select * where col1 &lt;&gt; ''""))

you could probably used *named ranges* to make it a bit easier to reference your columns, but i did it the old-school way.  note that columns d, f, h, j, l, n, p, r, t, v, x, z, ab are your client name columns.

that formula gets us our unique clients, but now we need to sum up their hours.  this is a bit messy, too, since those columns are also non-consecutive.  but this does it:

    =if(len(a2),sumif($d$2:$d,a2,$e$2:$e)+sumif($f$2:$f,a2,$g$2:$g)+sumif($h$2:$h,a2,$i$2:$i)+ sumif($j$2:$j,a2,$k$2:$k)+sumif($l$2:$l,a2,$m$2:$m)+sumif($n$2:$n,a2,$o$2:$o)+ sumif($p$2:$p,a2,$q$2:$q)+sumif($r$2:$r,a2,$s$2:$s)+sumif($t$2:$t,a2,$u$2:$u)+ sumif($v$2:$v,a2,$w$2:$w)+sumif($x$2:$x,a2,$y$2:$y)+sumif($z$2:$z,a2,$aa$2:$aa)+ sumif($ab$2:$ab,a2,$ac$2:$ac) ,)

i've wrapped individual sumif functions with a len function to allow you to drag it down multiple rows and avoid it returning errors or 0's.  once again, this function relies on your time values in specific columns:  e, g, i, k, m, o, q, s, u, w, y, aa, ac.

these functions will fail if columns are inserted.  but if this is the format you use for each month, it should do what you want.

i added these formulas to columns a &amp; b of your shared spreadsheet, but they can safely be moved elsewhere (just drag the entire columns where you want them), but it's sort of nice on the left since you'll always see them and not need to scroll all the way to the right.  i also took the liberty of freezing the first three columns so you can always see the date.

hope this helps!",1,,Airickson,0

1643840953,"this.  thank you.

for pc,  i found a list of the dow jones 30 stocks, and right click each stock symbol to [search the web for ""stock""] which created separate tabs.  then i was able to add all 30 tabs to a new 'dow jones 30' collection to cover the 30 searches needed (us market).

for mobile, i found a top 25 s&amp;p 500 stocks list that had numbers on the left side of the list.  i then typed into the mobile search each stock ticker plus the word stock.  so ""msft stock"" and added it to a mobile collection.  i did this until i had the top 20 stocks as you only need 20 searches for mobile (us market).

i am all set for the the rest of time.  the stock pages loads up fast.

1643841351,"ok, let's assume there is insider information exchanged. people who have insider information are not prohibited from trading stocks. every ceo, officer, or employee of a traded company has the freedom to trade stocks of that company, even if they have insider information. there are some rules for officers, but they still have large autonomy in how they trade the company stock.

i guess i mention this to say that you don't need blind investment or bans to deal with insider trading as a problem.

should lobbyists employed by microsoft also be barred from trading microsoft stock? they are privileged to the exact same information in the scenario you describe. suppose a lobbying firm handles microsoft, amazon, and boeing as clients. should employees of the lobbying firm be barred from trading stocks of all those companies? what about the ceo of tesla? should elon be prohibited from owning/selling stock in his own companny?",13,,ManyInterests,0

eth is not a coin or means to pay things with. it is a platform to develop solutions on.

that's the risk of leverage. you are responsible for the losses you make on the £500 you've bought. so if it drops by 10% you lose £50 and that's you done, kicked out with only half your money left, whereas without leverage you would have only lost £10 and still be in the game.

don't be greedy. better to take it slow, make 1%, 2%, 3% where you can and be a millionaire in a few years than take big risks and keep crashing out. it's all too easy to find yourself unable to go on holiday or in serious credit card debt.

[except ford still is sluggish, old school legacy. all their ev pushes are still behind the curve. they are reactive not proactive, and that just means you will be a follower and a laggard as a business, not an innovator and leader/best-in-class. this is even more important in the semi space. everyone cites the chips act etc etc, but look at the capex of the other peers in the industry and they absolutely dwarf what intc is planning to spend. if i recall correctly, tsmc is about to spend nearly 2x what intel is planning. sure intel is standing up new foundries, but so is tsmc. hell, they even have to use use tsmc to make some of their chips for them because that's how far behind generationally they are. i think there is a engrained national bias when people talk about intc when in reality, tsmc is more aligned and suited to provide for the needs of american industry despite being located in taiwan (for now as stateside foundry is being set up). f-35 fighters have tsmc chips, and they are the industry leading nm company by far. this is not a game for cheap spenders as the technical challenges of creating smaller and smaller nm chips get exponentially difficult.  perceptions can change fast, you are correct, but nothing intel has done or is planning to do is changing perceptions, as tsmc and other companies accelerate their moat and make more progress on future generations of nm chips with more capex.   that being said, there is a market for intel, and that's low powered basic chips for cheap laptops (but again, others are starting to do it better as amd is starting to eat away at that pie now). they aren't going to be the latest and greatest anytime soon, if ever again. which is why their stock price is where it's at and has been for the past 5 years. could be a value play, but i think more of a value trap. even with bringing gelsinger on board as ceo.](/r/stocks/comments/shv4xk/upping_my_stake_in_intcis_this_a_bad_move_my/hv5zs8l/)

[in 2018 arkk actually used to have a bunch of ultra large cap 50b+ companies in its top ten holdings - nflx, amzn, tsla, tcehy, bidu, nvda.  their top ten was rounded out by amd, jd, twtr, and sq which were in the 20-30b range.  so all large cap companies.  all were also profitable, or a few quarters from being profitable.  compare that to now, tsla is the only holding with market cap over 50b, and 4/10 are under 20b, only a few are profitable and the rest are racking up significant losses.  ark owns over 10% of some of these companies.  so as their assets under management grew by 20x, they went into increasingly small cap, less profitable, riskier companies.  i go by hanlon's razor and assume it's stupidity on their part, but it sure *looks* like a scheme to pump up smaller less liquid stocks and grift an inflated 0.75% mer off the top.  the arkk storyline goes way beyond a mere bubble in growth stocks, it's a bubble they created!  cathie wood appears to be cut from the same cloth as her good buddy bill hwang.  it may be a dead horse, but i think it needs to keep being beaten.  this is something where congress or the sec need to step up and impose regulations against how much of a company an actively managed etf can own.  there are a lot of novice investors who lost a lot of money from all the hype and marketing narratives that cathie spun.](/r/stocks/comments/sizewg/arkk_etf_has_become_a_dumpster_fire/hvcsjyk/)

nope. 

&gt;this statement confirms that ""what one gets it for"" (market value) and ""what it's worth"" (inherent value) are two separate figures. which was my whole point.

market value is just shorthand for the likely amount you can get for selling an asset. you can buy things at below market value for various reasons, or speculate that an asset's market value will rise in the future.

neither of these things imply that there is some otherworldly force deciding that things have objective worth.

1643906406,"the easiest way to think about it, is if you made money, in a taxable account, you owe taxes on it. if it’s short’s term, meaning you held those stocks less than a year, it’s taxed at your income bracket. meaning if you made 50k this year at your job, at the end of the year, the gov now thinks you made 50.5k. so you get taxed at whatever rate that is, which is probably like 25%. so you would owe 125 in taxes. my state doesn’t have capital gains tax, but i would assume it would be the same, for whatever the state tax rate is on your income. 

if it’s long term, you get taxed at 0 or 15%, again, depending on what income tax bracket you’re in. 

also, this is only on money you’ve made. so if you have apple stock, and you’re up 500 right now, you don’t pay tax on that. only on stuff you’ve sold, and only on the gains.",1,,muskratmuskrat9,0

on the other hand, my daughter also inherited 100k of apple stock, which is all of her money (she's a college student).   she essentially has to sell it, because needs a diversified and safer portfolio.    she's going to have to sell and pay cap gains (even with stepped up basis).    this is a good problem to have, but if it were already diversified, she wouldn't have to sell now.",2,,Starbuck522,0

continuing from that, let's say i bought a meta stock today, presumably my goal would be to sell the stock in the future and that is how i make profit (dividents notwithstanding, since not all stocks offer them) what is the actual end goal of thse stock? surely no one, including meta is actually gaining any tangible value from the stock so it will just keep trading around pointlessly until the company eventually ceases to exist or buys back the stock. so i just don't see the actual real value in owning a stock, and therefore why they appreciate in value (since their is no end goal)

dividends are not free money. you would likely be wise to turn on drip for these shares if your horizon is long enough. 

&gt;no trades/commission fees throughout the year

most brokerages don't charge commissions or fees on trades, that's very common these days. i wouldn't consider this a perk.

index funds *are* the market, and can be obtained for under .1%. has your broker consistently outperformed the market as a whole? for how long? and by how much? statistically, actively managed funds are not going to perform as well as the market as a whole over a long period of time. if they are matching or outperforming by less than 1%, their .9% fee is going to mean you are likely to lose money year over year vs just sticking your money in vtsax or something.

&amp;#x200b;

good evening my dear apes.

today's trading day brought our beloved stock a minus of 0.81 usd. so it had to close at 99.23 usd.  
the trading volume was 2.6 mio. compared to yesterday, it is a decrease of about 400k.

&amp;#x200b;

the heat map shows a deep red ocean. winners are found only very rarely.

  
almost all the popular courses decreased on the crypto markets today too. most of the popular courses lost between 1 and 4 percent of their value. the only clear exception is atom, with a gain of just under 6 percent.  


the [rrp update](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/comments/sjq6k9/daily_reverse_repo_update_0203_1640397b_buy_hodl/) of today shows us a value of 1,640.4 billion usd with 80 counterparties. compared to yesterday, this is an increase of about 13.5 bn usd.

1643944050,"thanks for the link.   

i think the point that bitcoin is a great sov but a poor moe is bang on.  my issue is the idea that $1usd today is $1usd a month from now, and that it is somehow stable.  

stability is a relative term.   relative to bitcoin, the dollar is horribly unstable.  relative to housing prices, it is also horribly unstable.  the price of housing in many places has barely even changed at all over the past 6 years relative to btc though. 

the usd is maybe nominally stable in the short term relative to retail items.  you might see the usd lose its value relative to something like grapes or beef from one week to the next, but for the most part, that volatility is acceptable.    we could go on and find different things that make the usd and bitcoin look stable or unstable. 

he says that if your credit card bill is $1000, you know the $1000 in your bank account will be able to pay that off today or even a month from now, but if you had bitcoin or apple stock, there’s no guarantee.   isn’t that an odd way to look at it though?  what if your credit card bill was 0.01 btc?  and you had $400 usd in your account.  there’s no guarantee your $400usd will be able to pay that bill in a month’s time.

if everything was measured relative to bitcoin instead of the other way around, the usd would not be viewed in a very good light as money, or as anything for that matter.  if grapes are priced at 0.0001 btc, you’d much rather just have 0.0001 btc than rely on the usd to be able to buy them tomorrow or next week.

for me, the issues with bitcoin as a moe are as follows:

- every transaction is deemed a taxable event in most countries(this isn’t a death blow since it is just red tape that could eventually go away)

- the transaction times can really slow down if the network gets too congested and users refuse to pay high fees.

- the fees can become annoyingly large when you don’t have time to wait for a transaction to go through

- even if those issues were gone, would it be good or bad if people were less likely to spend, and more likely to save, because they knew their money could buy even more if they just held it a little longer? if so, is that bad?

as a vendor, i’m sure i’d much rather have my customers pay me with something that will hold its value compared to something like the usd, which will rank over time with absolute certainty. 
but will my customers want to spend as frivolously if they know their money could buy them twice as much within a couple years?

i really don’t know the answer.   ultimately, people have to eat and pay the mortgage.  you may not want to spend your bitcoin, but you also don’t want to starve to death, so certain spending is necessary.  also, what’s the point of endlessly saving your money if you aren’t going to treat yourself eventually?

i happen to think that the digital currency that wins out will have to be one with zero fees, sub second transactions, and either zero inflation or very little inflation.",2,,[deleted],0

1643944997,"&gt;  people seem to be scared of things they don’t understand

&gt; some have been used as a pump and dump, same as some crypto coins.

exactly this.  the applications for nfts go far beyond what people understand right now.  

imagine your favorite independent music artist wants to raise funds to produce their first album. usually, this would require a record deal - which typically involves a massive upfront loan (which must then be paid back in full before the artist can take any profits), and after that the label keeps between 50-90% of royalties. (great video on that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ad1sntqq5y) for anyone interested).

so, instead of signing with a label, imagine they decide to issue 1000 nfts for $100 to help fund the production of the album... and all holders of these nfts will get exclusive first access to the album. 

ok, kinda cool right?

now imagine if instead of giving those 50% of album royalties to the label, the artist advertises that those royalties will instead be split equally amongst all holders of the nft. 

ok... awesome. now you, a fan of this artist, are not only supporting them but also sharing in their success. 

you now have an *asset* that is producing monthly income (a mechanic previously reserved for the music labels), that can also appreciate in value &amp; be sold at any time. 

the artist also now has 1000 fans who are invested in their work sentimentally &amp; emotionally, and will function as a grassroots marketing team (fulfilling the other primary purpose of a label)

if we take one of the most prominent independent artists of the past few years in lil nas x... (who i suspect is working on something like this already)... each holder of that nft would have amassed at *minimum* around $8000 by now, with a monthly passive income of around $200 just from owning the nft.  

not income because they bought apple stock, traded options on robin hood, or invested in bitcoin, but because they liked and supported an artists music via nfts. the only losers here are the record labels.",5,,yzy_,0

[there are some conflicting signals. zuckerberg dumped a couple hundred million shares of fb which says he either is not confident in metaverse or expects it to be a multi-year undertaking that will be rocky and prefers for his money to appreciate more elsewhere.  but the company also spent 19b in stock buybacks so far in q4.  basically they were in a vulnerable fundamental position because q3 foreshadowed their growth in users stalling (their earnings said they had slowed growth in 2021 q3, they were really upfront about it... people do not have an excuse to be blindsided).  also their reels ramp up toward monetization and user growth is in very early stage, tik-tok has a huge lead, and there's the apple privacy thing.  we're talking hundreds of billions of dollars across all the biggest megacorps have been invested into preparing the metaverse, they have the tools and influence to socially engineer this into reality no matter how skeptical or resistant most of us seem to feel about it.  they just have the free cash flow to push metaverse for 10 years if they have to and tough out the rocky part of adoption. we have potentially a lot of good signals to use - all the matterport, roblox, unity, nvidia, now microsoft (their ceo has said activision was to secure the game development skills and people to use toward the metaverse potentailly) are invested in the metaverse and are gunning for it.  the way correlations work, all these companies would prefer for each other to succeed. they want and maybe need each other to create more buy-in into the metaverse. facebook wants these dev companies to grow so that they can acquire them, before the other giant companies buy them. the vr development sector, they want to eventually be bought out by a giant like facebook and cash in so they want fb to be successful in getting the metaverse up and running as they are the most obvious and likely company to make acquisition offers.  we can look at their earnings and see if the advertiser interest in it is increasing.  they will simply not allow the metaverse to be rejected. they can bleed their coffers dry to the last penny, then they'll take on debt, they'll dilute stock, they'll do everything to make it work. to do otherwise is to admit they fucked up and misallocated hundreds of billions of dollars over the last couple years, in multiple m&amp;a deals. easy long on facebook (in the long-term), finding the perfect entry will come down to luck.  so that's the buy signal: look at twitter, pinterest, social media stocks with old, long time userbases, see if they're continuing to lose users in north america, or if they're growing enough in europe and asia to offset it. pinterest and facebook showed weakness in north america user growth the same time in q2-q3 in 2021. then it's about weighing that against the overall progress of metaverse ramp which you can use those other companies to measure.](/r/stocks/comments/sjzjxf/will_facebook_ever_recover/hvi6muu/)

zuckerberg has most off his wealth in facebook/meta stock. if stock prices remain low then he effectively loses money.

&amp;#x200b;

nebulous ""ackshully, corporations are legally required to maximize profits..."" bs aside, another huge factory in keeping prices high is recruitment. a lot of devs are paid in rsus, meaning a lot of wealth for the people actually creating whatever value the company has, exists mostly in the stock price rather than straight up salary.

&amp;#x200b;

blind and all sorts of other insider channels have been filled with chatter about how facebook simply cannot attract people willing to work there anymore. not the kind of people they want at least. it turns out being **the** metastasizing cancer on democracies throughout the world is *not* a huge recruitment perk.

&amp;#x200b;

so the company has been trying to offer a *lot* more compensation in the form of stock options. and, well, the stock took a shit. it is still down around 22% even after a slight recovery from yesterday.

&amp;#x200b;

low stock price hurts tech businesses where the main form of compensation is stock.

edit: of course i forgot the most important reason.

billionaires become rich via two methods: inheriting the money, or stealing it from people who actually create value with their work and then hoarding it. zuck is the latter. he contributes nothing to facebook other than negative publicity. even in the startup days he mostly stole the value that other people added, and he certainly isn't the guy who created and implemented their current revenue schemes.

tesla could have 100% market share but if a company sells 1 ev….or 26 in a single quarter.  the 100% share is is decreased.  but does it really matter ?

apple iphone holds 56% market share in usa 

30% world wide. time to sell the apple stock ? no and do you know why ?

because they have 30% market share with 80% of the markets profits.

1644008883,"i’ve read the article before and i fully understand the point it’s trying to make, and i agree to an extent that corporate tax rate could be higher and have less incentives. but it’s not like they’re just finding typos in the tax code for these so called “loopholes”. (massively simplifying) for example, amazon avoids paying property and city income tax for 5 years as an incentive to build a $5 billion distribution center in mid michigan because it provides us jobs, contractors, construction, infrastructure, income tax, sales tax ect. to the city/state they chose and the politicians deem those benefits outweigh the cost of potential tax revenue.

and again, using stock as collateral for a loan needs to be paid off using liquid cash. so while they avoid immediately paying $30 million in taxes on a $100 million purchase, it will be paid one way or another. if the stock goes anywhere but up, they will be on the losing end of that deal. case and point, if zuckerberg had done that yesterday before meta stock dropped 25% he would be absolutely screwed, and that’s the risk of it.",1,,shwaynebrady,0

1644012298,"meta stock dove because facebook has run out of new territories to expand into.  that ridiculous run of massive stock price raises was because of their ridiculous run of profitability.  any investor with half a brain knew that buying shares was basically easy money for the longest time.  so they amassed a huge amount of people who didn't care about the company and only saw it as a gravy train.

so the second that facebook's evaluations stopped their meteoric rise, it was inevitable that all these gravy train investors would abandon them.  they even said they expected this.

basically, like so many big name stocks, facebook's was overinflated already.  it was due for a realization at some point.  it's not because this 'facebook hate' that's the norm on reddit finally started to take shape.  facebook has been bashed for years on here, yet its popularity and profitability just kept going up as much as ever.

&gt;there seriously needs to be a new cordless vr headset in the market that lets you connect to a desktop and play steam games. once that happens, there is seriously going to be a huge market loss for oculus.

the money doesn’t matter the money isn’t a hurdle for microsoft,  it’s all about fan service at this point and if they did remaster’s of some of the biggest marvel activision titles like spider-man web of shadows dropped on the game pass i guarantee everyone with a sub to game pass or those who don’t have it yet would get it. 

it’s all about opening the gap on sony at this point. consider this microsoft stock is worth two and a half times sony’s and sony is still in big debt, the more gamers pull way from playstation the more desperate sony is going to get. and don’t forget call of duty the biggest gaming franchise on the planet is now owned by microsoft. if anything when the license is up for the multiplat deal it’s game over and sony is going to have to come to microsoft and meet their terms on negotiations

wrap your heads around just how big one trillion as a number is and they still have two more in the bank, microsoft could outright buy the licenses back for the ip of spider-man or any other marvel products if they wanted. disney is going to be able to see that sony isn’t where the money is anymore period. marvel won’t keep giving sony the exclusive deals.",1,,Stewart320,0

**natalie mordovtseva** graduated from a couple of ukrainian academic programs, 2 degrees, one in journalism (2006), referring to her having studied journalism at v.n. karazin kharkiv national university and later, psychology at taras shevchenko national university of kyiv. 

she has appeared as an actress in various crime dramas on ukrainian television, some speaking ukrainian but also a couple in russian for russian tv network. i think her acting is pretty good in these. it isn’t over-the-top like we see her on this show. 

ukraine true crime movie *evidence* shows off her acting skills, and she seems to be playing a school teacher. in the clip, natalie’s character pleads for mercy from her husband, who appears to be infuriated at her for getting a secret note.

[in *agents of justice*, natalie’s character larisa gets interrogated about her dead husband, viktor.](https://www.reddit.com/link/lujyc7/video/k1yx2invv8k61/player)

[in 2018 show called *a story of a crime*,](https://www.reddit.com/link/lvt4z0/video/77nr6lxfejk61/player), her character elizavita visits the kyiv city cemetery. the purpose of her visit was a dead husband who she’d once threatened to kill. when accused of murdering her partner, natalie pulls out a gun from her purse and takes a few shots at a tree, which she misses, claiming she’s not the one who committed the crime


as for **yaraslava zaya**, she has appeared on several reality shows in ukraine, in 2014 (she was 19), she appeared on a reality show called *fashion to the people*. in the reality show, yara mentions how she’s a “big party girl” and loves nightclubs (just like jovi does). “i also love rich men, foreigners probably,” yara declared, as a voiceover noted how her mother is a baker from zakarpattya and her father is a successful businessman from hungary. her parent’s divorce when she was little left her traumatized. yara had come to kyiv looking for love with foreigners. she said that she would marry a foreigner, as she considered them better and smarter than ukrainian men.

a year later, yara showed up on a dating show with a brand-new brunette look. the show wasn't so different from *90 day fiancé*. in *love online*, yara, who seemed to have a different nose shape, was dating a russian guy named raphael, who was living in barcelona. cameras followed her as she flew to his city and spent three days with him. however, they broke up in the end. this show had mentioned how yara had worked as a waitress, seamstress, and administrator. she also talked about having had a nose job (which she now denies).",5,,hamimono,0

ad revenue is generated based on the supply and demand of target audiences for those ads. less supply (audience) simply means that the bid costs incrementally go up for the marketer (demand).

a reduction in dau could really be a sign of many things, but an immediate or impending decrease of revenue is only going to happen if marketers decide to stop putting money in fb, which they are doing quite the opposite as you can see by googles and fbs y/y numbers.

another point is meta is constantly cracking down on troll/fake/fraud accounts so that can also lead to a decrease in dau.

1644081674,"basically, i need to pretend that there are no leap days in any year. once i have removed all leap days between the effective date and the retroactive date i just need to bucket which year the days fall on. now that i have a formula that scrubs out leap days on the total days between the dates, i can use that number to bucket year1=day0 through day364; year2=day365 through 729; year3=day730 through day1094; and so on. day 365 can not fall on year 1 since since year 2 starts with 365.

now it does not matter what the date is for each bucket since i have the exact number of days i need to check each bucket with, less leap days of course. i will post my solution and an excel file for it once i get years 1 through 5 set up with the required bucket logic. a sample of the formula is below with context for cell references. i hope this solution excites you as much as it has me!

maybe they earned and saved that money, (maybe not; maybe they stole it or inherited it) but earning and saving is not the (purely) capitalist/ investor or entrepreneur function.  investing is (or can be).  people can be workers entrepreneurs managers savers and capitalists, potentially all at the same time.  

but i can make an argument that there is no such thing as a risk free liquid asset.  there are simply different sources of risk, with different stochasticity (e.g., different variance or different volatility smiles, smirks, frowns).  so microsoft stock might be safer than 1-month euro or u.s. government securities, sometimes, and a mix of the two is even lower risk that either one.  

business need capital: plant and equipment, inventory, intangibles, and working capital.  if you show up at a job you don’t necessarily bring any of that with you.  so if you want to work at an integrated steel plant, and have no steel plant provided by these capitalists, you and all the workers need to work long enough to collectively save up $5 billion  let’s say, worth of capital  to build it.

[2 years? weed stocks are garbage. miners as well.    here's what i would do: i do something like this in my iras so i don't have to pay attention to them.    100k will get you roughly 800-850 shares of amd.   sell 8 weekly covered calls at the money, or slightly above whatever it starts the week at.   ok here's the math.   current price 123.39  a share x 800 = 99k  you can sell a $125.00 covered call for about 3.00 so, that's 300.00 per contract in your account.   8 (800 shares) covered call contracts = $2,400.00 in your account no matter what.   if your shares get called, who gives a shit? you make 2400 plus 1.69 a share at cost for a total of 3900.00 for the week. buy more on a dip, rinse repeat.    or do it with 400 shares and hold the others. sell rips, buy dips.    or just hold. its massively undervalued.  selling covered calls is good money, and if you have 100k capital, do yourself a favor in look into it.](/r/stockmarket/comments/slf6hx/lost_60k/hvqs3w3/)

1644153464,"nah, just means the enthusiast in us has to buy the new one. cycles are going so fast and availability so low, price so high. it sucks because by the time you get the new card more cards are released. people rarely can get the “new card”. seems like propaganda to up stock price. so… i buy a lot of amd and nvidia stock. it’s unfortunate that it is a good strategy. for “almost”everyone having a faster card than the 6900xt is useless. running over 60hz 4k native comes with a pretty hefty monitor price tag. anything 1440 or 1080 the 6900xt eats for lunch anyway. then the games are mostly ps5 and xbox ports. so the games shouldn’t get that much more demanding in the next 3 years unless they are poorly optimized. but i’ll buy the darn thing when i can find it anyway.",1,,Kentucky-Boy,0
1644155777,you can't arbitrage dstocks because they are unique assets without a parallels on an external exchange. they aren't stocks! the collateral underneath them is dfi and dusdc not tesla stock or apple stock. the new bridge potential might in the future give us the ability to transfer them off defichain - which would be kind of cool. but will someone on another chain view them as equal to other similar type tokenized stock so that you could arbitrage the price? i don't think so because the collateral system is unique and ultimately they aren't actually stock.,7,,Nerdimus-Maximus,0

if we wanna lose poole to boston okc or nyk in fa 2023... signing dlee and iguodala aka ""kerr's great vet temptations"" and giving them a single minute outside of contingency is step one in the process.  roster needs breathing room. too many advocates for sentimental stability moves as poole is literally a starter on 90 percent of nba teams.",6,,Nghbrhd_slacker87,0

1644198213,"the article is mostly about tracing the authorship and publication history of the songs. one of the final paragraphs is the most helpful for furthering your research:

“of course, within the framework of a single article it is impossible to mention all the songs of those years. nonetheless, the provided materials convincingly testify to the fact that the songs of the patriotic war of 1812 are currently of interest to modern readers. however, in the best case scenario, they are familiar with them from reprints of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily from the collection “fighting and folk songs of 1812–1815” (1877) and the anthology compiled by v.n. garteveld to commemorate the centenary of the patriotic war of 1812. in both works, the authors of the texts are not indicated.”

the ""fighting and folk songs of 1812–1815” (1877) can be found [here](https://www.prlib.ru/item/320452). you could search each of those song titles separately to find more information about them. 

here are some of the song titles mentioned in the article, but i can’t be sure that they are the most well-known or important ones as they're mostly used to point out trends in authorship and publication:

«что москва в руках французов это, право, не беда» и.а. кованько

“that moscow is in the hands of the french is, really, not a problem” i.a. kovanko

«песнь солдата армии витгенштейна» («для российского солдата пули, бомбы – ничего»)

""song of the soldier of wittgenstein's army"" (""for a russian soldier, bullets, bombs are nothing"") 

«солдатская песня» («ночь темна была и немесячна, рать скучна была и не радостна»)

""soldier's song"" (""the night was dark and moonless, the battle was boring and not joyful"") 

«козацкая военная песнь»

""cossack war song"" 

«песня ратников санкт-петербургского ополчения» («не труба трубит звонка золота») м.с. щулепникова

“song of the soldiers of the st. petersburg militia” (“not a trumpet blows the call of gold”) m.s. shchulepnikova

inflation is really tough in people who have to stop working early. when you plan things out, you estimate how much per year you need to live off of, but then everything doubles in price. like i said, i have access to money, so i’m just on my own, and that’s fine but not the party time it should be. they expect you to use all your resources before they help you, and i guess that’s fair. but if it weren’t for that apple stock i’d be working even if it was bad for me health-wise.",3,,EuphoriantCrottle,0

[thanks for the writeup.   when i look at fb’s numbers, they are growing revenue like crazy, and around a quarter of that revenue each year is being dumped into r&amp;d.  even though that’s likely to dip as their apps drop in popularity, it’s not going to disappear tomorrow.  around 6 years ago they stood up a hardware division, so i don’t think it’s realistic to pin their future hopes on existing social media platforms or even “similar to” platforms.  i’m not an acolyte or zealot of fb. in fact i deleted the facebook app last year.  so i’m one of the daus they lost.  but i do believe it’s realistic to assume integrating technology into our lives through some sort of ar/vr is inevitable.  it will trickle in slowly with first adopters making some small headway.  but in a decade the technology will become cheaper and more attainable for everyone.    i think there are two ways this plays out for fb:  1. they keep dumping r&amp;d money into developing a new kind of integrated platform/technology that succeeds.   2. they use their massive stash of cash to gobble up smaller companies who make breakthroughs in this area.   in either case, i see fb following a msft model of continuing to innovate beyond their current paradigm, and they’ve got the cash to do it.  i remember when msft tried to compete with the ipod by introducing the zune.  and they tried to compete with sony’s playstation by coming out with the xbox.  one worked, and the other didn’t.  you don’t have to hit a home run on every swing.  you can tolerate some flops as long as the winners are big.](/r/stocks/comments/skzu7w/metas_tough_road_ahead/hvp0872/)

[the $meta bagholders are funny, trying to point towards increased ad revenues as a distraction for their loss of daus. it is very easy for users to transition their time from fb/insta over to tiktok. a bit harder for the advertisers, businesses and ad agencies. requires a lot of time, money, training, market strategy and planning.  i work at a largish ad agency and i can tell you that what is happening now is we have been seeing client margins squeezed every month due to ever increasing fb costs and that we are currently training staff on tiktok and upselling tiktok ad packages to clients.   the user bleed from fb will continue while the transfer of ad revenue hasn't even started yet. unless $meta can pull a rabbit out of their ass quickly with occulus and the metaverse, my honest advice would be to stay away from this stock.](/r/stocks/comments/ska5ju/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_feb/hvl2szn/)

nasdaq:goog / 39

[&gt; a mega-cap stock moving like a penny stock isn’t a sign of a healthy stock market.  and the past few years of extreme bullishness with little downsides was a sign of a healthy market? nothing about the explosion of values in the past few years has been healthy.  the market recovered the losses from the covid crash in nearly 6 months to the day. last green day closed on the spx before the crash was 2/19/20 @ 3386. 08/18/20 it closed at 3389. 6 months while record unemployment and businesses struggling to even operate was still happening.   before this most recent dump, on 01/04/2022 spx closed at 4793. so in 1 year and 10 months, we added 41.55% in value to the spx. even using yesterdays close, we are at 32.22% up still. that is still a very healthy increase for basically 2 years where we saw 2 corrections. you still would have made a very tidy profit just buying and holding spy.   nothing about how this market is currently valued is healthy. valuations are sky high and not a ton of reason for it.   currently ~20% of the total spx value is in 5 tickers. aapl, msft, amzn, googl, &amp; goog. bring that number out to top 10 companies? you add tsla, nvda, brk.b, fb, unh and are looking at closer to 28%. with that kind of concentration at the very top, moves in any of those companies have a significant impact on the overall market. hell fb is a perfect example of what happens when those companies shit the bed.](/r/daytrading/comments/sjux8q/facebook_inc_loses_200_billion_in_market_value_in/hvkwyvt/)

depends on how you look at it. 

the article stated he resold a console for as much as $1,100, which is at least a 100% return on his initial investment. as a result, we can estimate a couple things...

* what he typically sold was far less profitable, thus he isn't particularly amazing at gauging potential markets 
* he sold a lot of consoles and things, though his overhead is insane 
* he is good at gauging products, but bad at logistics (amazon lists the weight of his pool at 101.8 pounds, so even if he made a killing, he might've got destroyed in shipping costs, which i know is overhead but i wanted more than two bullet points)
* etc

i mean, it could absolutely be worse, but when you factor in all the time and effort that went into making that margin, it probably wasn't worth it. like i could've done literally nothing, spent no time taking products away from people and pulled 36.21 (26.44%) simply investing in apple stock (ytd difference as of this post).",4,,Current_Garlic,0

if you’re going to claim something will save money you need to prove it buddy.

using random fake examples isn’t showing people how to save money. 

again you can’t understand because you can’t grasp something as simple if you’re going to make factual claims you have to use actual facts.

if i say “hey i can make you money by recommending this apple stock” and then i make up fictional stock prices as an example then you’re not saving me money.

you’re peddling bullshit.

again this really isn’t hard. your example sucks because it’s just random numbers you made up to try prove a point. that’s the problem. 

don’t tell people you’re saving them money without using actual numbers. holy fuck this shouldn’t be that hard.

you think i don’t understand your concept but i do because you’re point isn’t anything new. “loft jacking is dumb” has been beaten to death.

the fact is i do understand your point. you don’t understand mine that it doesn’t matter if you can’t prove your bullshit. there’s a reason everyone in this thread is saying your point is either simplistic, dumb, or just full of shit.",3,,Baconator73,0
1644263803,"i have many friends who’ve made statements like that - it’s a version of the truth. keep in mind their position and roles within the company.

for example, software engineering in general at intel is treated 2nd tier - and the swes at intel bitch a lot about being stuck writing firmware.

i know someone at intel who just left for nvidia for a distinguished architect position (used to be an intel fellow working with mobileye). he has nothing but good things to say about how pat is starting to change the company and that intel matched his compensation that nvidia offered to keep him. at the end of the day, he left because nvidia stock appreciation is alot more then intel. the same person also says how much of a nightmare otelinni/krzanich were to intel. all of the baggage pat gelsinger needs to fix.

it looks like intel is changing for the best and we need them to. they are americas most valuable manufacturing company after all.",2,,Jealous_Classic_3082,0

i didn’t say you’re wrong. i said you’re not proving your bullshit. 

there’s a difference. your reading comprehension is so pitiful it’s actually terrifying.

this isn’t that hard.

if someone tells me hey buy apple stock it’s a good investment and i say “why? give me evidence?” isn’t saying you’re wrong it’s saying back your shit up or you’re talking out your ass. you claim you’re using a “basic example” which is assumption because you have to make up clubs that don’t exist to prove your point. in the real world we don’t operate on random assumptions. and then trying to say it will save money means nothing. you’re not proving how it can save money. 

again i understand the point you’re making because it’s been beaten to death. i never said i disagreed.

i simply hate people saying things are idiotic or people should listen to their claims if they’re not providing proof. not that fucking hard. especially when they’re beating to death concepts that aren’t new and they think they’re reinventing the wheel.

you: “if you buy a stock at $1 and sell it at $5 you make $4.”

everyone: “ok but how does that relate to apple stock? or can you show me an actual stock that is $1 that grew to $4 so we know this actually happens and not a hypothetical.”

you need to put the info into some structure then loop it.  there are various ways to do that, this is one i would use:

    $versions = @{
      vs2019e = ""c:\program files (x86)\microsoft visual studio\2019\enterprise""
      vs2019c = ""c:\program files (x86)\microsoft visual studio\2019\community""

      $v
      $versions[$v]

1644339843,"my guess is that op has a mixture of amd, nvidia stock portfolio. since he is also mentioning tsmc my guess is that one is in his portfolio too. 

once q2 er comes out - intel's (12th gen sale numbers) amd will drop.

once/if intel comes out with a decent gpu (doesn't have to be ˝the best˝ just decent, good performance for a fair price) nvidia and radeon(amd) will start bleeding market share.

so yeah i've noticed a lot of these ˝let's shit on intel˝ posts across reddit and yahoo finance. 

easiest fucking inverse in my life.

my guess is some people bought nvidia when it mooned to over $300 and others hate seeing amd slowly bleed back to $100. 

plenty of people bought tech companies while they were at their all time high in 2021. 

now intel will once again be a direct competitor to amd. basically since 2016 amd had de facto monopoly. stock price usually goes down once competitor shows up with better/similar product (12th gen definitely falls under better product category). 

same story for nvidia i don't see their stock price going over 300 anytime soon. and if intel's gpus end up being just decent nvidia can say: bye bye market share.

edit:

1644346703,"most, if not nearly all, software engineers cap out at those ""mid-tier"" roles, i.e., ""senior software engineer"" or l5/e5. very few folks make it beyond that level, even at the big tech companies. maybe a few percent, tops, progress beyond l5/e5. at that point it's no longer just about raw talent but also about playing the political game to get noticed and promoted.

and the only reason the compensation is so high currently is because of off-the-charts stock appreciation as well as a tight labor market for tech workers. nothing lasts forever, and you'll see those numbers revert to something more reasonable over the next 5 years, if not sooner. 

just look at the last tech bubble—people made crazy money for a few years in the late 90s, but that didn't last. just look at how cisco's stock price shot up and then cratered around the year 2000. microsoft stock also took 16 years to break even from the 2000 peak. and so on.

there are three possibilities in this example:

1. wages are equal to price of fish minus cost of boat ($w - $v = $z)

2. wages are less than price of fish minus cost of boat ($w - $v &gt; $z)

3. wages are greater than price of fish minus cost of boat ($w - $v &lt; $z)

in the first case, that is op's example, and there is no real distinction between the two forms of fishing. wage-labor has no special meaning in that case.

in the second, op would not accept the wages over simply renting the boat and selling the fish himself.

and in the third, op is clearly not being exploited since his employer is offering him greater wages than he would be able to make on his own.",2,,coke_and_coffee,0

1644360874,"i’ve dealt with this issue for years across several devices and software versions and i want to get to the bottom of it. basically, i don’t like that the default reminders app doesn’t allow you to well, remind you multiple times of something. i’m very forgetful and rely on reminders. as such, i found a very good app for this, called due, which reminds you as frequently as once a minute if you want. 

anyway, my problem is that the app will not remind me when the app is closed or the app hasn’t been manually refreshed in a while (still in background processes). i have notifications enabled, no night mode, background refresh on, have tried restarting, restoring, etc. 

this isn’t exclusive to this app. i notice that a lot of apps just stop sending notifications in many cases if the app isn’t running or hasn’t ran in a while. the only apps that seem immune to this are apple stock apps. 

is there any way to fix this? i just want my apps to work as intended for me.",1,,xMicro,0
1644361362,"tech companies are expected to grow at a very very aggressive rate. they don't give out dividends, so the only way to make money of investing in them is by capital gains.

so msft never really became a ""bad idea"" the way apple got in the 90s (and even then it took 10 years of constant disastrous ideas that all failed and lost the company a lot of money before they were considering bankruptcy, and even then they still had enough money to buy nextstep and bring jobs back onboard).

but if you look at the msft stock you'll see it's growing exponentially until 1999, when the dot-com bust kind of dropped it. at this point it settles to a very flat line until at least the 2010s. before this microsoft just failed to expand much, they only had one victory: xbox. they were leaders in the smart-phone area and completely lost the train to apple, and then brand-newcomer google. microsoft could have been the next android, but they were unable to get their shit together. similarly they had the internet by the balls, and then lost control of it and didn't make any money of it. while of the faang only one of the as was not an ""internet company"". now don't get me wrong: microsoft was a solid company, was not horribly mismanaged, had resources and was stable. but it just wasn't growing at the rate, not getting the tech of stuff, it wasn't moving on new markets. it certainly wasn;t going ""to the moon"".

but then msft started getting some stuff correctly. they got azure in, and were able to place themselves as a ""everything as a service"" provider. windows 7 came out fixing the core problems of windows vista and positioning the company in a place to grow. they tried once more to get into mobile with windows 8. while it was not as great as they wanted, it wasn't a loss. unlike previously microsoft made a good entry given that they were in a losing place now (entering a market dominated by apple and google), and ultimately the surface tablet/laptop was enough of an innovation and success to justify the investment. it still limited them and slowed them a bit. after all there's a reason they were still about 6 years away from being part of the list.

and then they started getting things much better. their cloud investment paid off, and the company did a successful culture shift to focus on their new priorities (so they began to open source more). the r&amp;d department is still exploring interesting areas (things like hololens and what not). and they got gaming down, becoming a behemoth in their own, especially with the buy of minecraft, which has paid for itself handsomely at this point. ms shifted away from tying to enter the mobile market, and instead made a huge dent on tablets by shifting the focus from ""a really big phone"" to a ""really versatile laptop"", and it was a huge success. they dropped most of their attempts to take over the internet, and instead focused on the area they already where strong at: enterprise software.

it still took a bit, but at least since 2019 i was seeing serious, and reasonable too, arguments that the m should be added. at this point msft had done some really strong decisions, and kept it going for enough time that it was obvious it wasn't a fluke, and the stock had started growing exponentially as you'd expect from it.",10,,lookmeat,0

1644368419,"&gt; please explain in detail what you mean by this?

i mean labor-power is not his only  costs.  he hires a fisherman at $50, sure, he also purchases boats/poles at $x.

&gt; are you saying that if we write the word ""employment"" on the paperwork then now the fish guy is going to expect more money than he would have otherwise?

what?

&gt;  of course i put numbers in to make the scenarios the same!

sure, then we agree, this is meaningless.  you could plug in any numbers you  want.  it could ""just so happen"" that the amount the rentier  is willing to pay is such that $w - $v is &lt; $z.  it could ""just so happen"" he's willing to pay $0 and the fisher is forced to sell his fish.

&gt; that is a cop-out answer. because the justification that is constantly thrown at me from your side is that exploitation is when you sell your labor and the capitalist makes a profit. so that argument is based on individual transactions.

yawn.  i couldn't care less about the conversations you've had with others.

&gt; am i being exploited in scenario a...

if  this refers to ""marxian exploitation""  then the notion that **you** are being exploited does not exist.  exploitation occurs at a class level.

&gt; ...then you're conceding that exploitation is a meaningless word.

1. they have $50 billion in cash **after** their $19 billion buyback, and yes the zucc cucked himself by cumming too early, but hol' up
2. they sport a p/e of 16, a 4:1 asset/liability ratio, 65% yoy increase in cash flow, and currently trade at 15x fcf. $aapl, $msft, $amzn, $goog, and $tsla have a p/e of 25-188 (lol), higher debt ratios, lower margins, and trade at 27-272x fcf (guess who's at 272)
3. weekly (and daily) rsi are the most oversold they've been since the post-ipo dump, and the weekly is curling to make a bottom
4. it bounced off the may 2018 and feb 2020 high today
5. the vwap is $220.78, and easily in reach
6. delta flows are primarily being driven by jan 2023 calls being sold, but iv is also in the 83rd percentile, so expect those to be closed out as iv decreases
7. the current level also shows a successful test of the -2.618 fib retrace from the september 2021 dump
8. the weekly 200 &amp; monthly 50 ma sit right at $230, so closing successfully above that will easily take it $266 and eventually $290 to attempt a gap fill
9. the aforementioned mas just happen to be right above the 2018/2020 trend, at $228.56

this is a great spot to dip a toe in, with a stop below $200. if we get a weekly then monthly close over $230, the party is back on.

tl;dr: the metadump can easily become a metapump. zucc can buy spot &amp; pton for $45 billion, and still have enough for a super-yacht bigger than jeff amazon's + 300 000 metric **fucktons** of cocaine to make these hoes dance",71,,Liquicity,0
1644370685,"&gt; i mean labor-power is not his only  costs.  he hires a fisherman at $50, sure, he also purchases boats/poles at $x.

in all three examples the fish guy previously owned the equipment. if you really think that his equipment cost somehow alters our interpretation then i’m happy to listen.

&gt; sure, then we agree, this is meaningless.  you could plug in any numbers you  want.  it could ""just so happen"" that the amount the rentier  is willing to pay is such that $w - $v is &lt; $z.  it could ""just so happen"" he's willing to pay $0 and the fisher is forced to sell his fish.

well if the fish guy said to me “ok you have two choices, either i can hire you to catch fish for $50 or you can rent my boat and sell me your fish for a net of $40”, then obviously i’m just going to pick the $50 option.

or if he offered to hire me for $50 and i said “actually what i want to do is rent your boat for $25 and sell you the fish for $75, as in literally i’m going to take $25 out of my pocket and hand it to you, and then when i come back with the fish i want you to take $75 out of your pocket and hand it to me”, then the fish guy is just going to say “makes no difference to me.”

1644371206,"&gt; so why would i use my investment as a currency if i think it will appreciate in value ? i dont want to be the guy who bought a pizza with a lot of bitcoins. are there actually benefits of using it ? am i missing something ? what are your thoughts guys ?

this is a false premise and is often labeled ""opportunity cost"".  for example, when my grandfather died in the 80's, he left me $10,000 to go spend on college, which i did.  instead of going to college i could have spent the money on apple stock.  that would have sucked until the last 10 years or so, but ultimately it would have ""banked"" more money than my rewarding life and career to-date.

or imagine this, what if dollar's weren't fungible, and you labeled each one as you got it.  this dollar came from may jan-2022 paycheck, and this one from my march-2021 paycheck, and this one from my june-2015 paycheck.  some of those dollars have rotted in your bank account for weeks, months, years or decades.

now... the ""cost"" converting that money to crypto the day it is born is ~2%.  so... how many of those dollars would have rotted less sitting as crypto all those years instead of fiat.

don't think about the life of the theoretical dollar after you spend it, but focus on it's life from it's birth (paycheck) to its need (food, rent).  in most cases, your better converting every penny you make to crypto the hour you earn it, but not always.  just most of the time.

it's a math problem... and not a very difficult one.",1,,brianddk,0

i hate the idea of some unknown paper pusher deciding my fate, and whether x claim is approved and y claim is not and z claim has a 1,000 deductible. all you're doing is paying some company month after month just to have them hire a person to tell you why your claim is denied because some line on page 4,653 says that floods are covered only when it's the fifth of may and the current president of zambia is a protestant. oops! claim denied!!

just be your own insurance company. put a thousand dollars aside, buy some apple stock with it, and then keep adding 50 bucks a month and drip. there, now you are your own insurance company. you will do right by you. 

want to insure your phone too? add another 10 dollars a month. best insurance company ever. no ""excessive claims"", no ""claim history"" no middlemen. your money grows every day you don't need it. 

this may not work for every type of insurance, and not everyone has a thousand dollars to spare. but for those who do, being your own insurance company is a fantastic option.

[wondering who is really to blame for the collapse of pton stock. is it the ceo, or the investors, or a combination? i think it's a combination. a blind man could have seen that the growth of pton was due to people not being able to go to a gym and that this was always going to be temporary. if the ceo and the rest of the executive at pton thought otherwise, they were fools. if investors, and i'm not talking about people buying 100 shares, i'm talking the fund managers, didn't see this for what it is, they should be out of a job as well. all this stock was ever good for was catching it at the right time in the early days of the pandemic and selling after doubling or tripling your money. i have owned a peloton bike for 5 or 6 years now and i was not foolish enough to buy into the idea that this growth was limited for a number of reasons, the smallest being the pandemic. i think the cost of the bike and the monthly fees are bigger inhibitors than people being stuck inside for the better part of a year.   the other nail in their coffin is remote work. i initially purchased my pton bike because of my schedule. i used to get up for work between 4:30 and 5:00 am, to catch a 5:30 train to nyc, and then get home around 6:00 pm. last thing i wanted to do was get changed and go to a gym at the same time everyone else was, then eat dinner at 8:00 pm. so i got the bike. but i've been working remotely for going on 2 years. once i feel comfortable enough to join a gym, i will. how many other people did the same thing as i did? got a bike because they didn't have time in their day to go to a gym, but now they do.](/r/stocks/comments/snhagh/peloton_ceo_john_foley_to_step_down_transition_to/hw2x1su/)

[dude seriously research that but not here. do you really want a horse hit answer from a 17 year old retard?  management gets authorisation from shareholders to issue new shares, this means for example if there's a total share count of 100, they may be authorized to issue another 400 shares to a total of 500 shares.  they would sell shares either in a direct placement with an investor or publicly.  for the existing holders of the 100 shares this means that they hold now 1/500th of the company per share instead of 1/100th of the company per share. the effect is called dilution. effectively it reduces the intrinsic value per share (however for example if a company grows fcf by 100% per year and issues 10% new shares per year, the net fcf per share still goes up significantly and the stock price will likely rise despite the dilution = the overall value grows quicker than share count, hence share value increases; obviously the opposite happens if dilution hits a contracting company, then the value per share is decreased exponentially)  for the price the company gets for these shares it really depends on the market. for example if the company issues shares into a falling stock price, they do increase downward price pressure while during a rally the market may a sob the new stock without negative impact on the stock.  many companies have an pre-authorized potential of shares they can issue. for example, pltr started at ca. 1bn has diluted to 2bn to date but has approval to issue another ca. 20bn shares.  on the other hand amc pre squeeze had ca. 125m shares outstanding but had approved 500m. during the squeeze they have issued all shares possible to raise cash and avoid bankruptcy. when they requested shareholder to to issue more shares after that (to repay debt) the shareholders(=apes) denied this request, thus the share count is still ca. 500m  the company (=management) needs shareholder approval for share issuance because it obviously directly affects shareholder value.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sntnj4/facebook_aka_meta_i_dont_like_this_stock/hw5xliz/)

[yeah it isn’t ideal to do all of the time but sometimes it makes sense for your portfolio. stocks often churn or even crash further days after the initial bad news. it’s better to sell down 20% than 50% imo. look at ark shareholders over the past year as an an example of that. i’ve had relative success selling some positions and putting it in to higher conviction stocks.   another example: i went through a phase of being in to spacs. i bought one that was a commercial ev spac. i bought at 15, it crashed before it even came close to the spac merge. i sold(still slightly above $10 nav at least on the commons) so that i could put the rest in to aapl. currently it’s stock trades below $5, the warrants are like $1. had i stuck it through i’d be out most of my money, plus the apple stock has gone up $75/share since i bought it. opportunity cost is underrated. i did similar moves with some smaller stuff like lyft. all of which has continued to get blown up this winter. i’d be out a lot more money if i worried about “selling low”](/r/stocks/comments/snj2lt/cathie_wood_dumps_142_million_of_twitter_stock/hw338kc/)

1644411184,"i would recommend you use [*am faclair beag*](https://faclair.com) and (if you can buy it) colin mark’s *the gaelic-english dictionary*, they’re much more reliable than wiktionary or the gaelicgrammar wiki.

both give verbal nouns. in afb they are marked with the abbreviation *gr. ag.*.

i don’t mean that wiktionary is bad – it has many excellent entries, it can be really good especially for etymology. but it depends on the specific entry, and sometimes you’ll find nonsense there too. so never trust it entirely and cross-check it with other sources, just in case.

as for the verbs in question, it seems wiktionary is right (or at least not completely wrong).

both afb and colin mark give *gluasad* as v.n. of *gluais*, agreeing with wiktionary, but afb also gives another verb form *gluas* with verbal noun *gluasadh*.

both afb and colin mark give *beucaich* (agreeing with gaelicgrammar), but colin mark notes also alternative form *beucail*. afb also has entry for *beucadh* (even though it doesn’t give this form in the entry for the verb *beuc*) – like in wiktionary.

so *beucadh* looks good too (it is regular enough, and there are also hits for it in [dasg corpas](https://dasg.ac.uk/corpus/) – gaelic literary corpus) so it seems it is used too, even though not registered by colin mark.

you should get used to a lot of variation in some words in gaelic – especially with plural forms and verbal nouns, different dialects can sometimes form them very differently (and not always you’ll find all the forms in dictionaries).",9,,silmeth,0

one is very similar to symfony validator, using annotations/attributes to validate properties, and auto casts from string/whatever to the php type. this is used to hydrate dtos (for the api and for the database...) and so on. and the errors might not be human readable (ex: cannot cast array to string).

&amp;#x200b;

then for fast form validation, we have a library that will match a list of rules (regex, callable, closures, etc) with error messages, to the post data (array of strings usually). this gives human readable errors mapped to the field that caused the error.

we ended up with this, because the forms kept changing, but the dtos that talk to the back-end were not. (ex: designer/ui guy wants this or that, then changes their mind 10001 times, but needs to see a ""working prototype"" to make those decisions)

1644431986,"if it ""*just so happens* that $w - $v = $z"", you've answered your own question. the two scenarios are probably quite different if any correspondence is purely coincidental. you've got to make some prediction about what the arithmetic actually would be in each scenario. 

yes, rent is exploitative. if anything that's *less* controversial than the claim that wage labour is exploitative; some capitalists would agree with the former. you haven't indicated why scenario 2 is so obviously non-exploitative that if the two scenarios are fundamentally indistinguishable, then scenario 1 is also obviously non-exploitative.

but if there is a difference it hinges on x and y. in the first scenario your wage income depends only on x. in the second your income depends on y. in scenario 1, the fisher makes: wage x x. in scenario 2, they make: price of fish x y. it's unlikely that the wage will always be set so that these two values are equal - even if the wage was set *daily*, the employer would have to honour that regardless of how much fish is caught, (that being pretty much the definition of ""wage""). how much the employer/rentier makes in each scenario is not known, though; all we know is they end up with some fish at the end of it, but we don't know what they're selling it for. which is kind of an important variable given their entire goal is to turn a profit.",1,,yhynye,0

1644440622,"&gt;can someone explain to me how $nvda is not overvalued out the ass as every article i read see screams to buy $nvda as it is a discount right now.

there's a strong argument that the whole market is overvalued, but assuming it's not then nvidia is undervalued relative to the rest of the market.

there's a lot of writing that fb is now severely undervalued (i'd say that it's arguable that even if we were to have a correction that it could be undervalued), and i would agree with that.

however, the thing you'll hear from tesla bulls (and that i think is generally true) is that pe doesn't really account for future growth. similarly, it doesn't really account for future decline. facebook is likely to see a declining userbase, libra/diem failed, whatsapp doesn't have a clear path to being especially profitable despite incredibly high usership, and insta is big but users are fickle and could move to the next big thing (just as happened with vine, snapchat (tiktok being the big competitor here)).


meta is banking on being what people think of when they consider the metaverse(tm), and that the metaverse will be a huge part of people's life. that's a huge bet. 

while tesla has the clear argument that evs will become more and more popular and that tesla could be a big part of that market, it's not clear that the metaverse is the future of work nor entertainment. neither is it clear that meta will be a big part of that. 

oculus will be a big part of the hardware and software market, but that's because out of the 3rd party devs on the storefront, not especially because of meta or anything they offer (cheap headsets are one thing, but that's a minor part of meta's strategy) - that means competition from steam, psvr, microsoft store/gamepass (if they shift toward more vr). apple (realityos), egs (if they go toward vr), gog, amazon (project vapor and luna), etc. oculus headsets are not a walled garden either, they can be used with steamvr, etc, so even if their hardware business does well, it's not a guarantee of success",1,,LegateLaurie,0

1644455156,"xerox did make a computer out of this - the xerox "" star"" iirc. wasn't very practical and way expensive. they couldn't get it down the last mile into a marketable product which is actually a very difficult job.  they let jobs have the tech and some of the key people for some apple stock. to apple's credit they did a lot of good work polishing up and refining it to come up with the lisa and the mac. but the myth that apple invented the gui is dead wrong.

the mac itself in its first iteration was under-powered, expensive, and lacked applications and actually kind of flopped as a product compared to what it should have been, though everybody was very blown away by the idea of it - eventually it got some momentum though but the opportunity passed them by too.  gates slipped in and stole that future away from it with windows which could simply be installed as an app on existing ibm and clones lol. early windows was a rather poor imitation of the mac os but it was good enough and much more inexpensive and practical and could run on dos machines as a nice app if you wanted it - that did get momentum big time, lol.

apple could have simply added the gui and pretty much all of the new tech to their existing line of computers (apple iis) but jobs wanted his own thing independent of that competing division. things might have been very different  . .",2,,an0therdude,0

the business of investing can be described, in an oversimplified way, as the business of raising and carefully allocating capital to generate returns that exceed the costs associated with raising that capital. similarly, a company like apple hopes to generate revenues that exceed the cost of those revenues. a real estate company can deliver a product such as a house or a building. similarly, a company like apple delivers a product such as a phone or laptop.",1,,NegativeProphets,0

[you mention in one of your replies that it’s all hedge funds. it's more nuanced, it's not all hedge funds. actually, hedge funds come and go all the time, i think they have some absurd   failure rate as many do poorly unless they have something that gives them a particular edge/alpha. what you are actually referring to when you say hedge funds is institutional market makers, which there are only a handful. as their name implies, they are there to make a market, to serve both sell side and buy side. this is where the fluctuations happen. sure, for the average person, msft moving up one day a certain amount and then going down a certain amount the next might seem pointless, but the fact is whenever the market is open, there are ideas of what an asset should be bought/sold for. imagine a bazaar, with throngs of people, not everyone may actually buy or sell for the same price.    a market is living and constantly changing. one person might be willing to buy at one price given one piece of info, another might be willing to sell given some other piece of info. and so   market makers facilitate this, and ""wall street"" moves up and down. these days, some institutions use algorithms which buy/sell at fast speeds, but the market is really a large amorphous entity which is why i put wall street in quotes, because you are also taking part in that market. so is calpers, california's largest pension fund, so is billy huangs family fund or buffets, or some basement quant fund started by some mit grads. the market has participants from all over. a large portion of the money is in fact institutional yes, but   these institutions can vary, and not all are market makers. edward jones managing money for a large pool of hnw clients is considered an institution, so is jp morgan, a major investment bank. you have blackrock, which packages up all sorts of etfs for people to buy (and also was tapped by the fed for the feds bond purchases early in 2020), who is also considered an institution. the market is very diverse is what i'm getting at, and everyone has a different idea of what is considered fair market value for an asset. with all these diverse opinions, every participant has the same goal, sell something for more than you bought it at. that's why stocks move everyday. because a market is being made, and supply/demand kicks in for pricing, some people aim for short term gains and scalps, to the microsecond if it's a quant fund, others on a different time horizon. and that's just equities, the same happens across the commodities floor (mostly digital now but used to be a pit at the cboe), or the bond market, or the currency market. i think the scale at which the financial markets span is really hard for many people to comprehend. and in every one of these markets, there is a market to be made.     ](/r/stocks/comments/soq5l0/why_do_stocks_go_up_one_day_and_then_down_the_next/hwb166b/)

[dude seriously research that but not here. do you really want a horse hit answer from a 17 year old retard?  management gets authorisation from shareholders to issue new shares, this means for example if there's a total share count of 100, they may be authorized to issue another 400 shares to a total of 500 shares.  they would sell shares either in a direct placement with an investor or publicly.  for the existing holders of the 100 shares this means that they hold now 1/500th of the company per share instead of 1/100th of the company per share. the effect is called dilution. effectively it reduces the intrinsic value per share (however for example if a company grows fcf by 100% per year and issues 10% new shares per year, the net fcf per share still goes up significantly and the stock price will likely rise despite the dilution = the overall value grows quicker than share count, hence share value increases; obviously the opposite happens if dilution hits a contracting company, then the value per share is decreased exponentially)  for the price the company gets for these shares it really depends on the market. for example if the company issues shares into a falling stock price, they do increase downward price pressure while during a rally the market may a sob the new stock without negative impact on the stock.  many companies have an pre-authorized potential of shares they can issue. for example, pltr started at ca. 1bn has diluted to 2bn to date but has approval to issue another ca. 20bn shares.  on the other hand amc pre squeeze had ca. 125m shares outstanding but had approved 500m. during the squeeze they have issued all shares possible to raise cash and avoid bankruptcy. when they requested shareholder to to issue more shares after that (to repay debt) the shareholders(=apes) denied this request, thus the share count is still ca. 500m  the company (=management) needs shareholder approval for share issuance because it obviously directly affects shareholder value.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sntnj4/facebook_aka_meta_i_dont_like_this_stock/hw5xliz/)

[people aren’t a collective hive mind. i imagine transactions going on like neurons in a brain. you want 10 shares of msft, someone else is selling their shares. the price is determined by who is more enthusiastic, buyers or sellers.   one person sees $310 and says “time to book a profit”, another person has a different entry point and likes the company and believes it’s going higher. one person is putting some in to their roth ira, another person has already retired and is slowly liquidating every month.   so much of the market is the big institutions too.  i put some money into voo or other etf’s and they buy tiny bits of everything. other people buy mutual funds, which are also constantly either passively or actively traded. then you have day traders of all sorts trying to find and ride swings in momentum.](/r/stocks/comments/soq5l0/why_do_stocks_go_up_one_day_and_then_down_the_next/hwah4wk/)

[you mention in one of your replies that it’s all hedge funds. it's more nuanced, it's not all hedge funds. actually, hedge funds come and go all the time, i think they have some absurd   failure rate as many do poorly unless they have something that gives them a particular edge/alpha. what you are actually referring to when you say hedge funds is institutional market makers, which there are only a handful. as their name implies, they are there to make a market, to serve both sell side and buy side. this is where the fluctuations happen. sure, for the average person, msft moving up one day a certain amount and then going down a certain amount the next might seem pointless, but the fact is whenever the market is open, there are ideas of what an asset should be bought/sold for. imagine a bazaar, with throngs of people, not everyone may actually buy or sell for the same price.    a market is living and constantly changing. one person might be willing to buy at one price given one piece of info, another might be willing to sell given some other piece of info. and so   market makers facilitate this, and ""wall street"" moves up and down. these days, some institutions use algorithms which buy/sell at fast speeds, but the market is really a large amorphous entity which is why i put wall street in quotes, because you are also taking part in that market. so is calpers, california's largest pension fund, so is billy huangs family fund or buffets, or some basement quant fund started by some mit grads. the market has participants from all over. a large portion of the money is in fact institutional yes, but   these institutions can vary, and not all are market makers. edward jones managing money for a large pool of hnw clients is considered an institution, so is jp morgan, a major investment bank. you have blackrock, which packages up all sorts of etfs for people to buy (and also was tapped by the fed for the feds bond purchases early in 2020), who is also considered an institution. the market is very diverse is what i'm getting at, and everyone has a different idea of what is considered fair market value for an asset. with all these diverse opinions, every participant has the same goal, sell something for more than you bought it at. that's why stocks move everyday. because a market is being made, and supply/demand kicks in for pricing, some people aim for short term gains and scalps, to the microsecond if it's a quant fund, others on a different time horizon. and that's just equities, the same happens across the commodities floor (mostly digital now but used to be a pit at the cboe), or the bond market, or the currency market. i think the scale at which the financial markets span is really hard for many people to comprehend. and in every one of these markets, there is a market to be made.     ](/r/stocks/comments/soq5l0/why_do_stocks_go_up_one_day_and_then_down_the_next/hwb166b/)

[i don't fret over msft googl or unh for example.  i just hold them and know that over 5 years i'll probably have more money.  probably a little better than the sp500 over the same time frame.  for example asml.  if i had put $10k in it 10 years ago i'd have about $270k vs.  $50k with the sp500.  most of my larger position stocks have all handily beat the sp500 for over 20 years also.  so i'm betting they'll hopefully continue that trend.  if not then i'll accept it.  i do try and buy my shares at good times though and that's why i keep a little cash on hand.   but then again weighting comes into play.  if i have 20 stocks with 1% in each it's sort of my own little index of stocks i think may do ok for whatever reason.  as you can see though the majority of my holding are over about 10 stocks.  the other 50% is etfs and small positions.  so effectively i'm indexed.  i look at my whole portfolio as a big index anyways.](/r/stocks/comments/so4tga/do_you_count_cash_when_figuring_stock_percentages/hw75exo/)

1644503756,"&gt; it's not a tax. if you hold bitcoin for a year and it declines in value by 5%, is that a tax?

it’s unbelievable that i have to explain this to you. 

do you realize there is a difference between say, apple stock going down 5%, and the board of directors creating more shares out of thin air, causing the value of each unit to decrease by 5%? 

one is a natural market condition that is out of anyone’s control, the other is direct dilution at a chosen rate. the fact that you think inflation is just some unrelated natural market force says everything about where your argument comes from. it isn’t changing based on speculation, it’s changing based on someone literally printing themselves dollars out of thin air and spending that. if you don’t understand how that’s a tax on every other existing dollar in the system, you don’t understand dilution at all. 

&gt; except it's not force.

yes it is. taking 10% of my buying power as a penalty of saving is a force. you are literally penalized for saving. how are you that blind to this? you are like the biggest fed reserve bootlicker i have ever encountered 

&gt; the money was always in the system. ""money in the bank"" (bank deposits) is actually a de-risked form of debt (it is backed -- overcollateralized in fact -- mainly by mortgages, corporate bonds, and treasuries). similarly, cash itself is backed by treasuries held by the fed.

what a dumb take. yes of course you got the money from the system. the point is you either have to risk it in the system again, or lose massive % of your buying power if you want to simply save it. all because they are printing new money and spending it by the trillions. 

&gt; for example, buying treasuries, corporate bonds, or mortgage backed securities with money just means taking one form of debt (issued by the fed and banks) and ""unwrapping"" it into its slightly riskier backing. it allows you to get a little more return for a little more risk and has virtually no effect on ""the system"".

then you go on to explain how you can make more by risking more. no fucking shit. but the point is people shouldn’t be forced to take risks *just to keep what they’ve already fucking earned*. you are paid in a decaying dollar that you have to find ways to risk it so that it doesn’t die. amazing system. 



&gt; or until real interest rates become positive again.

oh yeah because that just stops inflation in its tracks doesn’t it. it’s fine guys, your salary may have lost 3% of its buying power this year but at least it’s not the 7% from last year! be grateful! 


&gt; not really. it might cause the fed to have to redeem more dollars or raise rates sooner to keep medium term inflation on target. unless you printed so many dollars that usd became unsound, the fed likely wouldn't have trouble keeping the usd's value on target.

do i really have to explain to you how this works. when the economy is measured in units and you increase the number of units massively, but the economy doesn’t change, what happens to the value of the units?

printing off massive amounts of dollars devalues the rest of them. this is a fact. this is literally how inflation has been working since before you were born. i can’t believe i have to explain this to you. what is the buying power of a dollar in 1950 compared to now? you do realize that devaluation because of money printing, right? 


&gt; the dollars that the federal reserve issues are fully backed by high quality collateral. the usd is a stablecoin; the federal reserve issues and redeems dollars as needed to target 2% medium term cpi inflation.

oh are they? so the 13 trillion they printed last year, they have collateral for all of it. lmao. 

the entire reason the value of the dollar is bleeding every single year is because these dollars are being printed out of thin fucking air. if they were bringing in shipments of gold in synchrony with the amount of money they’d be printing, the usd value compared to any scarce asset wouldn’t have lost a vast majority of its value over time. but it has, because these dollars aren’t backed by jack shit. are you really going to claim inflation is a myth? like your entire line of argument is proven wrong by every single economic measurement in the world for all of history. 

&gt; when the issuers of the gld etf create a bunch of new shares of gld out of thin air and sell them to buy physical gold, are they ""diminishing the value of everyones gld""? of course not. the whole point of gld is to track the price of physical gold. the whole point of the usd is to track 2% medium term cpi inflation. it's a unit of account, not an asset! savings accounts, cds, bonds, etc. are the assets, and their real rate of return is determined by the market for saving/borrowing.

oh really has an ounce of gold lost it’s buying power massively over the last 50 years? the fact that you actually think these 2 things are the same thing is incredible, and explains why you have such a terrible understanding of this. yes, the fed printing off 20 trillion dollars is the same as a fund using money to buy gold. lmfao holy fucking shit that’s hilarious. 

&gt; then what i said doesn't apply. remember, i said ""if you have a savings account which is large enough that losses due to negative real interest rates are significant"".

yeah, exactly, you think the losses are inconsequential because you’re comparing that amount of money to your own income, which again, is not how the world works at all. 

&gt; then minimum wage should be tied to inflation and/or an additional social safety net should be put into place. historically, real wages increase most during inflationary environments, not deflationary ones.

oh, how’s that been going? you’re now going with the argument that minimum wage has scaled with inflation? again, categorically wrong by every single metic you would possibly find. 

&gt; i was clearly referring to the market for savings/investment. that doesn't apply here. the effect of inflation on $11 of savings is negligible.

again, negligible because 10% of her paycheck is negligible to you. but it isn’t negligible to her. god damn you have a sheltered and privileged view of the world. 


&gt; a 7% decline in real wages matters. we have actually seen real wages increase at their fastest pace in decades for lowest wage workers in this more inflationary environment.

a 7% inflation rate without a 7% pay raise *is a decline is real wages*. and for a ton of people out there, that’s a reality. you realize there are people working for minimum wage out there, right ? that is a thing that exists. and minimum wage hasn’t scaled for inflation, at all, for years and years now.",1,,soggypoopsock,0

1644518036,"that's true, but you have to compare how fast the stock will grow vs. how fast the car debt will grow. apple stock has risen on average about 28% every year for the past 10 years. but a typical car loan is only a few percentage points with good credit (my most recent was 3%). that debt is growing a lot slower than the money in the stocks. so even though op could pay off the loan right now, they'll *likely* have more money in the end if they keep the money invested rather than paying off the loan immediately.

that said, if op has trouble keeping a budget, it might be better *psychologically* to pay off the car loan immediately because ""nothing"" is easier to budget for than ""$300/month"".",3,,restrictednumber,0

1644524981,"i don't think it's amazing or unexpected. if cnn tells us all that apple is about to post their best quarterly earnings report ever, apple stock is going to immediately go up. it's not going to wait for the ""official"" announcement. 

cnn has told us all that the fed is going to raise rates 3x this year. mortgage backed securities are publicly traded. same thing. the act of verbally stating they're going to raise rates is, in fact, a policy choice being enacted. it amounts to the same thing. assets trade on rumors, jpow saying clearly ""i am going to do this"" is a lot more than a rumor. and, when he holds those press conferences, he knows exactly what he is doing.

i doubt we're going to be at 5% in the near or mid-term (jpow would likely just hold another press conference and say things causing rates to go down), but i of course have no crystal ball. if people stop applying for mortgages, that's a factor too, a supply/demand factor. if abc home loans is paying out a bunch of six figure salaries for underwriters to sit around twiddling their fingers (because there's nothing to underwrite), it stands to reason that abc home loans may drop rates to garner more business, just to give that underwriter something to underwrite.",32,,aardy,0

1644525874,"by, ""their interests"", they mean their direct financial interests. for example, a senator buys a bunch of apple stock, and then votes for subsidies to apple or something of that nature, only because he wants his stock to increase in value, not because he thinks that the subsidies are actually good. similarly, someone might buy stock in bing, and then vote for antitrust action against google because it will increase the value of stock in bing.

in fact, even allowing the possibility of this will invariably taint the decisions of policymakers, as there will always be financial pressure towards certain decisions based on stock ownership. there's even just a bias in favor of publicly traded companies, at some unmeasured cost to privately owned businesses. they're not randomly investing, or investing in the economy as a whole; they're invested in specific companies, and have a financial interest in raising the value of their stocks even at the expense of other domestic companies, or even the united states as a whole.

allowing senators to trade stocks in any capacity inevitably puts them in a position where they will be choosing between something that benefits them personally and something that benefits the country. for that reason alone, it should be banned.",1,,pfundie,0

1644535034,"a good rule is: always pay off the debt with the highest interest first. this is almost certainly the credit card.

if you’re buying apple stock over time, you would most likely be better off getting rid of the cc debt first before investing in more stock. you would have to get extremely good stock returns to make that pay off better than wiping out a cc debt at maybe 19% on average.

you’re saying you pay $800 on the card every month, and add $800 each month in new purchases. so you’re breaking even? if you’re only charging as much as you can pay off and zero the balance due each month and avoid paying interest, you’re doing okay. this is how i use my cc, like a charge card not for credit. you may need to get more disciplined about your budget if you’re always spending every penny that comes in and not having anything left for savings, though.

if you can set up direct deposit so that every pay you direct 1% or 10% or whatever you think you can handle off the top into a separate savings fund outside your primary spending account, that may help you save. it helps me that i “pay myself first” and that’s taken out even before i see the deposit in my checking account.

you didn’t ask but sounds like you may be putting all your stock investment eggs in one basket with apple. apple’s been a good stock but counting on only one stock is risky. maybe consider a low-cost s&amp;p500 index fund for diversification.

good luck!

edit: forgot to add about the car loan… depends on whether you prefer to be debt-free with only $1000 in your savings, or carry a car payment but have $8000 available if you need it. if you wipe the $7000 car debt how disciplined will you be about paying the amount of your car payment back into your savings until you get that back up to $8k? personally i’d rather have the rainy-day reserves available and keep paying the car payment, maybe wait to pay the car off when it gets down to $5k or $3k so you maintain a decent reserve.",1,,ldh_know,0

[i generally only buy tech stocks because it's the only real area of the economy i understand well given i work in tech, and generally the high-quality, high-beta names typically found in tech stocks can be expected to out perform in the long-run at the cost of short-term volatility.  also people also don't understand valuations. comparing high margin, high growth companies to mature, low margin companies has cost people far more in opportunity costs than investing high value tech ever has. i've literally heard the same argument for the last decade about tech valuations. there is no bubble outside of very specific sectors within tech and specific names.  i do agree that most people probably invest in tech for the wrong reasons. owning stocks like tsla and aapl clearly have a cool factor that a stock like bp doesn't and this attracts retail investors. you also tend to find inexperienced retail investors are highly influenced by attractive growth narratives. this is partly why you get excessive valuations in sectors like ev and weed stocks -- everyone thinks they're being smart at the same time.  it's also worth saying there isn't a correct way to construct a portfolio. it's fine to be over allocated to a certain sector so long as you're doing so understanding the risks. i don't really agree with diversification unless you're worried about volatility of your portfolio. for example, if you want to own a lot of risky stocks it probably makes sense to have some of your portfolio in very stable names to reduce potential volatility to more manageable levels, but if you're young and own a few large-cap tech stocks the benefit of diversifying into other sectors to reduce volatility is going to be limited.](/r/stocks/comments/soydnx/serious_question_for_retail_tech_investors/hwcrnem/)

1644773138,"i think you make some interesting points, especially in the short term, but there's a reason apple is an s&amp;p 500 stock. you note the shoddy computer they made in the 80s (rather debatable if you ask me considering the state of things back then)...but here we are in 2022 and they appear to have done something right the past 40 years. 

i'm no expert though, but i do hope you are wrong...mainly cuz i have apple stock. 

very anecdotal, but i know so many people that buy the new iphone each offering and are still excited about it. it makes no sense to me as the price tag just doesn't seem to justify the alleged ""upgrades""...but they never listen :)",8,,JesseB999,0

1644961508,"yes that's nice and all, but you should look into the collapse of the soviet union and how the russian oligarchy was formed. it's not comprised of just the few who were in power already under the ussr.

when the state collapsed, everything was privatized. factory workers were handed documents which were shares in the ownership of the factory. many of them did not really understand what that even meant and of those that did, most didn't understand the true value.

the few that recognized the situation went about buying or trading to collect as many of these shares as possible. people would trade their share for a bottle of vodka or a few rubles.

just imagine if everyone who owns apple stock was just handed it and didn't really get what it was, and you went around buying people big macs or giving them $5 for their holdings. you pretty quickly would become very wealthy and powerful and have a controlling share of apple.

this is what happened, but on a nationwide scale, and the oligarchy was formed.",1,,SOwED,0

10 booster boxes @ $144 ($4 a pack) = $1440
sell it all for $10,000 and that’s a profit of $8,560

if i spent $1440 in apple stock 10 years ago, it would’ve cost call it $20 a share, that’s 72 shares i could’ve bought. cost right now is $172, sell it all for $12,384

edit:
idk why i put stock prices in here from 10 years ago lol but looking at stock prices from 3 years ago yeah the boxes would net you more profit. the key point i’m trying to make tho is below 
—

that’s a profit of $10,944, more than the evolutions booster boxes. and that’s accounting for booster boxes being $144 cost and it selling for $1000, if you look at ebay sold listings it’s more around $750. i just picked apple but if you are smart you’d prob just put it into a s&amp;p500 index fund.

now there’s huge differences in pokemon vs apple and the stock market in general. there was a huge popularity push for pokemon in the last two years or so, which has caused demand to shoot up and since it wasn’t as popular as it is now there’s less sealed product (low supply). there’s tons of people just like you thinking they’ll get rich if they keep sealed product, which means supply goes up and since demand is up right now, the pokemon company will print even more, increasing supply. 

so in 10 years you’re looking at an environment where there’s tons of sealed product, and who knows if the demand for pokemon product continues as much as it is now. or more likely, it’ll decrease back to how it was before. high supply, low demand. 

compared to the stock market. where there will always be demand and there’s always gonna be stocks to invest in.",5,,[deleted],0

the 45dte contracts are priced around $26.00 so that's pretty attractive.  it's the next larger trade i'm putting on for my account.  the plan is to manage the straddle until i let it get assigned on the put side and then just continue writing the calls until they're gone.

apple inc. (aapl): aapl is currently the largest 13f portfolio stake by far at ~48%. it was built between q1 2016 and q1 2018 at a cost-basis of ~$35 per share. since then, the activity has been minor. the stock currently trades at ~$173.

note: apple stock split 4-for-1 in august. the prices quoted above are adjusted. berkshire has a ~5.4% ownership stake in the business.

bank of america (bac): berkshire established this large (top three) ~14% of the portfolio position through the exercise of bank of america warrants. the warrants had a strike price of $7.14 compared to the current price of $47.79. the cost to exercise was $5b and it was funded using the $5b in 6% preferred stock they held. there was a ~30% stake increase in q3 2018 at prices between $27.75 and $31.80. since then, the activity has been minor.

note: berkshire’s overall cost-basis is ~$14 and ownership stake is ~12%.

american express (axp) and coca-cola (ko): these two very large stakes were kept steady during the last ~9 years. buffett has said these positions will be held “permanently”. berkshire’s cost-basis on axp and ko are at around $8.49 and $3.25, respectively, and the ownership stakes are at ~18% and ~9.5%, respectively.

kraft heinz co. (khc): khc is currently a fairly large position at 3.53% of the portfolio. kraft heinz started trading in july 2015 with berkshire owning just over 325m shares (~27% of the business). the stake came about because of two transactions with 3g capital as partner: a ~$4b net investment in 2013 for half of heinz and a ~$5b investment for the acquisition of kraft foods group in early 2015. berkshire’s cost-basis on khc is ~$30 per share compared to the current price of ~$35.

moody’s inc. (mco): mco is a 2.91% of the 13f portfolio stake. it is a very long-term position and buffett’s cost basis is $10.05. the stock currently trades at ~$330. berkshire controls ~13% of the business.

note 1: verizon is currently trading below berkshire’s overall cost-basis of ~$59 per share.

note 2: berkshire likely avoided disclosing this stake in the q3 2020 13f filing by making use of the “section 13(f) confidential treatment requests”. an amendment filed in february disclosed the activity.

u.s. bancorp (usb): the 2.15% usb stake has been in the portfolio since 2006. the original position was tripled during the 2007-2009 timeframe. it was then kept relatively steady till q2 2013 when ~17m shares were purchased at prices between $32 and $36. h1 2018 had seen a ~16% increase at prices between $49 and $58 and that was followed with a ~25% increase in q3 2018 at prices between $50 and $55. the stock is now at $58.61, and berkshire’s cost-basis is ~$38. they control ~10% of the business.

davita inc. (dva): dva is a 1.24% of the portfolio position that was aggressively built over several quarters in the 2012-13 timeframe at prices between $30 and $49. the stock currently trades at ~$117 compared to berkshire’s overall cost-basis of ~$45 per share. q3 2020 saw a ~5% (2m shares) selling at $88 per share.

note: berkshire’s ownership stake in davita is ~38%.

general motors (gm): gm is a 1.06% of the 13f portfolio position that was first purchased in q1 2012 at prices between $21 and $30. by q3 2017, the position size had increased by around six-times (10m shares to 60m shares). q4 2017 saw a reduction: ~17% selling at prices between $40.50 and $46.50. there was a ~38% stake increase in q4 2018 at prices between $30.50 and $38.50. h1 2021 saw a ~17% selling at prices between $40.50 and $64. the stock currently trades at $49.67. berkshire’s cost-basis on gm is ~$31.

1645028017,"after my last 11% raise, i trickle 2% of my paycheck into btc and eth, and i also convert 5% of the profits of my ebay business into the same.

basically about $200/month i pick up in crypto.

it's the same as i put into microsoft stock, and both combined are about what i put into my 401k for the maximum employer match.

since creating my portfolio two years ago, my crypto is roughly break even. my microsoft stock is up 17% (21% in the last year). my 401k is up 23% (but is roughly 1:1 matched by employer match, so it's double my investment, and then some considering tax deferment on the 401k and doubly considering the fact that the other investments will eventually have capital gains).

btw, amd and nvidia go up and down with crypto, so if you want to get into the crypto wave but don't want to touch cryptocurrency, amd stock is roughly pegged to the price of bitcoin by proportion.

i will not be selling it, likely ever. i'm willing to lose it all to see where it goes. if btc hits 7 digits by 2025, then awesome.",1,,ZetaZeta,0

i can get literally any graphics card i want... i bought one that's actually a good deal in this current market. congrats on paying double msrp for the most overrated feature in gaming. i put the difference into amd/nvda stock... i'll sell my 6700xt when next gen cards are actually selling for msrp. 

for right now it's just a stupid amount of money for a capability that doesn't (ok... maybe ""barely) works. 

dlss on the other hand, that's a legit feature that's worth some money. just not worth the $300 difference in cost versus the 6700xt, and 8gb of vram vs 12gb tipped the scales pretty easily in 6700xts favor.",1,,Infinityaero,0

1645045537,"well what is a debt trap? extending loans because of the influence it will give rather than simply wanting a return on your investment. it's impossible to untangle these reasons since it will vary from case to case and we can't know the motivations of the ccp. 

the port in sri lanka is a good example because it's part of a strategic move against india called the string of pearls, rather than a belief in sri lanka gaining so much trade and being able to repay those loans. (didn't take them long to default) their lending in africa and many remote island countries has raised similar suspicions among tons of people. that's why it keeps getting brought up.

the owner of the atlantic has about $10.5b of apple stock, a company that works closely with china. i don't know those other sources you linked but i am automatically skeptical because of china's influence in western universities. straight away i see d. brautigam as one of the authors who is also one of the sources in the study the atlantic put together, i think a. singh was in it too but i've already closed those tabs.

i trust my own logic and reason which is built up from reading tons of sources and trying to make sense of it all. as i've said, i don't think china has behaved particularly badly and i'm not criticising them. i mainly just wanted to point out a logical fallacy in what you said originally and highlight that the ""debt-trap"" is still there even though, china hasn't decided to spring it yet.",-6,,[deleted],0

1645098014,"""much like nfts...?""

yeah im sure all the nft people buy the ugly pictures generated by an algorithm that they could just download for free so they can look at them ..like genuinely tell me if you ever saw anyone say they bought an nft because they like to look at them, because i certainly havent.

""like classic cars, there are definitely people who collect art, and wait  
 for it to appreciate. especially right around an artist's death.""

that only works for physical objects, and it certainly wont be the case for nfts, who is going to buy these soulless pictures especially when you can just download them for free? keep in mind this isnt mona lisa where its literally unique a trillion of identical nfts can exist at the same time.

""sounds like boomer logic. we have been paying for digital assets for   
decades now, something doesn't need to be physical to have value.""

you are right something doesnt have to be physical to have value but that wasnt the argument.

""until we find out how to encourage radioactive decay into gold instead   
of lead, and then the price plummets. or asteroid mining, or discovery   
of a massive gold ore vein, or a dozen other unlikely hypotheticals.""

yeah being able to mass produce gold would really hurt its price lets hope no one invents a way to mass produce nfts or worse let other people copy it.

""i fail to see what makes them so obviously different to nfts""

because you are basically buying part of a company who will produce something or provide some service and generate revenue which will mean you will receive dividents from it and if the company is successful the value of your stock goes up and you can sell it, and i know what you will say next ""but you can also sell your nft for more"" but your nft doesnt produce anything, you dont get anything from owning it so selling it to someone is the only way to make money with it, but sooner or later the price of the nft will grow to the point where no one will buy it since they know they cant make a profit from it and you will end up being stuck with it, plus with stock you will always get something out of it even if the company goes bankrupt something you cant say for an nft.

""nah, because some stocks have value in the worth of the company behind   
them. a widespread customer base, ownership of land or resources, etc.speculative stocks are pieces of a company that has no actual value, but their   
price is still high because of the company's possible future.""

the whole point of speculative investment is that you buy the stock cheap, eg. new company is created with super cheap stock so you drop 100 dollars on buying stocks and if the company makes it, congrats you get a huge return on your investment, if not, well you knew the risk recover what you can and better luck next time.

if the stock of a company is high its not speculative investment even if you know there is no actual value since you can just sell your stock now for profit provided you got in early, you might as well buy microsoft or apple stock where you get safe but slower returns.",1,,Numerous_Row_7533,0

1645131887,"keep in mind, there isn't a single professional trader, broker or hedge fund that allows the contract to get anywhere close to the expiry of the contract.    
if the stock price stays level for a week, you will buy back your contract and take the $50-$75 profit and repeat for a later expiry.  
if the stock price goes up, you will buy back your contracts, and immediately resell at a higher strike, and most likely a later date.  
if the stock goes down you will buy back your contract and make $100-$150 profit and repeat.

the idea behind the strategy is to be long term holder of the stock, and ideally have held that specific stock long enough you are already deep in the money.   any downtrend won't affect you.  like anyone who purchased $aapl over 6 months ago, or $tsla 6 months ago

and i'll say again, your goal should never be holding the same contract at expiry.  buy back and roll over if stock increases.... buy back and get ready to sell another contract if share price drops.  myself, when selling weeklies, i don't like to go past wednesday without buying back.. monthlies, i will check in every wednesday to see what the stock is doing.

the bulls are hoping that this could perhaps be the start of an abc rally as the stock carves out the b leg of the current rise. 
that means they are hoping for an eventual c leg that takes nvidia stock up through $270 and leads the charge back toward $300-plus.
to do that means nvidia stock will need to clear several weeks worth of highs, as well as the 21-week and 50-day moving averages, and the daily vwap measure.",3,,Traditional_Good4693,0

with regards to hybrid assets, i've always liked the idea of combining different assets in one basket. it feels like a hedge to me at some point haha. of course one can buy all the assets within hybrid, but this means more transactions, more fees, meybe different exchanges and so on. so it's always a useful option.

i have a friend who retired permanently in his early 30’s. microsoft stock options helped but he wasn’t an engineer, manager, or software programmer. what really enabled him to retire so young was a trust/investment fund his parents started when he was a baby and contributed to every month for 30 years. he didn’t do anything but get hired at microsoft, not get fired but not get promoted either, and just used the standard stock options.

then he became a libertarian who felt no business should be regulated because regulations prevent the businesses from cutting corners, from shirking costs onto taxpayers. from gouging customers, or from stealing employee wages.",2,,DublinCheezie,0

1645208845,"i have played ark.  and every other major survival game.  i often use ark as an example of the direction mmos should have gone post wow, and where they would have gone much earlier if projects were being directed by enthusiasts instead of bizdev people.

i've made products on roblox, worked in mobile in the early days on ar products as a unity dev, played eve off/on for nearly two decades, and tried out nearly every major game ip. i was there for virtual boy, wii fit, wow peak popularity, rockband, google glass, pokemon go, have a vr headset, have a personal vr project, and currently i'm using one of my game related reddit accounts to post this.

if you notice there are trends with all those products - they don't take over the world permanently.  ark is doing well currently due to the 2020/covid bump, but if you look at the userbase charts it was [on its way out](https://playtracker.net/insight/game/1375) in 2019.

i like gaming products and social engagement related products.  i do think there is and will be an industry for them.  but it's not going the way of ready player one like many think, and if meta is banking on it then it's already on its way of going the direction of yahoo, myspace, aol, etc because those projects aren't going to permanently support a stock valuation the level meta is at.  keep in mind that a lot of the population is resistant to fb related products - people join fb out of necessity, insta is new enough that youth still join it willingly, but fb had to acquire it.  similarly fb had to acquire oculus.  if fb had home grown oculus it would have received significantly less support.(consider how much backlash non adoptees had to google glass beta testers - many going in to public spaces with google glass were treated with outright hostility due to people not wanting recording devices pointed at them...that was a product from google a decade ago when people were still more neutral towards the company rather than meta now which has had a negative sentiment for a while).

we will gradually have more ar and vr tech, but vr games are going to continue being niche.  10m users is nothing to a big tech company like meta that cares about having billions of users and having continual major growth on the horizon(and oculus only has 4.6m cumulative sales last i checked - that's not much better than msft's zune).  msft stock dipped hard back around 2001 after it reached max penetration with windows and struggled to find users in other markets.  keep in mind that it was first to market with some products and had second place with others...but it was never dominant enough for it to matter to the stock price, those projects were barely keeping the company relevant and it was going the way of ibm or hp as a whole.  xbox, zune, bing, surface, windows phones, content stores, buying linkedin, and surface tablets/laptops didn't do much  -  it took azure to save the company from increasing irrelevance.  stock price followed this, it took over a decade for it to return to relevance.  i had coworkers roll their eyes when mentioning the stock awards they got during that period because it was just going to be turned to cash asap and turned in to a different stock instead of being considered a valuable capital asset like today.  so unless meta has a major world shaking product reveal...my sentiment isn't too keen on it.",1,,lolredditor,0

&gt;bill gates is the richest person in the world. he achieved that station by co-founding and then leading microsoft to incredible success. most of his wealth came not from his salary, but from the microsoft stock that he owns, equal to about 10% of the company’s outstanding shares. wealth gained from stock price appreciation is not taxable until you sell the shares. by holding most of his shares since the company’s founding, mr. gates delayed paying tax on those capital gains. by donating the shares to the bill and melinda gates foundation, that wealth will never be taxed.

&gt;thus, the fact that capital gains are not taxed as long as the asset is held (and, in real estate, not even when sold if the proceeds are reinvested in a “like” asset) and the existence of the charitable donation tax deduction have provided bill gates with what might be called the biggest tax break in history. the federal government likely lost out on $15-20 billion. even for the federal government that is real money, enough to, for example, run the state department for about a year.",1,,evo_pak,0

what i mean by that is i can only really see a problem if you own a very significant amount of stock in a company that stands to very clearly benefit significantly from a particular policy. maybe this is just a personal thing and i'm off base, but, for example: say i owned like 1000 shares of apple, which is currently trading at $167 per share, just to pretend that i'm someone with a far above average amount of money invested in a single company. now let's say i have the ability to push a policy that would result in a 10% bump in apple stock. that seems like a pretty extreme change, and i'm not even really sure if any one policy could do that, but even then that's only a $16k increase in the value of my stock. 

that's not chump change, but also, if i've got enough cash that i've invested that much in apple, how much of a difference is $16k even going to make? how much effort does it take to push this policy? how likely is the outcome? 

what i'm feeling here is that it would be a really unusual situation where a lawmaker has enough invested in a single company, with the opportunity to implement laws that would make enough positive impact on that company, for it to really register as a strong temptation.

**false** and a total over simplification to support your weak ass argument. there is far far more to a ponzi scheme than that. 


&gt;the scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g., product sales or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. a ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the **non-existent assets they are purported to own.**

**non-existent assets they are purported to own.**

**non-existent assets they are purported to own.**

this alone makes bitcoin fail the ponzi test.  stop making shit up please. 


&gt;well, let's say you buy a farm. you don't need to sell it at a higher price to make a profit. you just grow food on it and sell the food. or build a house on it and sell that. or rent the house. an asset is valuable because it's productive. when you buy an apple stock you don't need to sell it, as you get something, part ownership of a company that is productive. holding a $doge does nothing for you.

where does bitcoin or doge claim to ""be productive"" ?

there's no claim or false promises of being productive, producing anything or even appreciation. it's up to the people to decide what it's worth in dollars.

sure there's all sorts of youtube and twitter moonshot idiots but they don't officially speak for any of this shit. if you listen to those people you're an idiot.

farms and real estate require property tax, maintenance, security and upkeep.  bitcoin doesn't need any of that. it's evolved into an alternative store of value that is maintenance free.  again if you don't want it do not buy it but those who do want it and buy it will continue to do so and bitcoin isn't losing people and acceptance it is gaining actually.  keep your blinders on if you want to 🤷🏻‍♂️. i really don't care.",1,,spicolispizza,0

1645245234,"i'd typed a lot and the page crashed. damn reddit.

what does ""real-time"" mean? from my understanding, the availability of the hotel in a city may vary from time to time, but they are all fixed at the beginning. that is, you know all the future conditions. i'm not sure if this is accurate but i'll try a solution based on it.

define $f(u,t)$ as the maximum of the $nights_in_hotel$ when you are in city $u$ and $t = total_nights$.

in city $u$, you can travel and update the status:

$f(v,t+1) = max(f(v,t+1),f(u,t) + marked[v][t+1])$

$v$ stands for a neibour city and $marked[v][t+1]$ stands for the availability of the hotel in city $v$ at time $t+1$.

kind of dynamic programming. all the status in $t+1$ only relies on status in $t$, so:

```c++
for(int t = 1;t &lt;= t;++t)
    for(int u = 1;u &lt;= n;++u)
        for(edge e = head[u]; e; e=e[e.next])
            f[e.v][t+1] = max(f[e.v][t+1],f[u][t] + marked[e.v][t+1]);
```

the time complexity of this solution is $o(mt)$ where $m$ is the total number of edges and $t$ is the maximum nights spent.

now you know that when you spend $t$ nights and in city $u$, you can have stayed in hotels for $f(u,t)$ nights. calculate the maximum of $f(u,t) / t$.

however, if there are modifications after which you want to recalculate the result quickly, the algorithm is not that satisfying. an optimization is to push all the change status into a queue and update via bfs. this may work well in real life though under the worst conditions the time complexity is still $o(mt)$.

as evidence for that, i observe the near cult following surrounding him and particularly that one most directly observes this if one is an omaha resident.

&gt; do people that live in california (where tim cook lives) have a better idea of the future for apple?

do 40,000+ people show up to the apple shareholder meeting - _every year_ - expecting to personally meet cook, have pictures taken with him, and have him answer their questions - _on basically any subject_ - for 2 days? do people know what restaurants cook prefers to eat at and go to those restaurants just because cook does? do people show up specifically to shop at businesses cook/apple owns or frequents? omaha is literally overrun by buffet groupies for like 2 weeks and there are places i won't eat at or shop at (think the mart or borsheims) while they are in town. do businesses corporate offices in in cook's town basically shut down when the shareholder meeting takes place because pretty much every middle manager and above takes the day off to go hear cook talk at the apple shareholder meeting? this kind of thing has been going on in omaha since i was a kid in the 70's - a decade  before apple even ipo'd.

would you know things like this if you didn't, for example, live in omaha?

do people buy just one share of apple stock so they can go to apple shareholder meetings to meet cook? does cook request that local residents open their homes via airbnb to out of town guests so there are enough accommodations for the groupies coming to meet cook at his shareholder meeting? does the local paper run almost daily stories about cook and his philanthrophic or business pursuits? do people pay $4.5m to have a charity dinner with cook (a yearly thing)? or, pay $210,000 for his 20 year old billfold?

has apple refused to ever split stocks such that the original stocks now sell for almost $500,000 and are held buy a largely elderly group of people (which i can directly observe in omaha because these people show up to the shareholder meeting en masse)? when warren is gone and these people die, do you think their children are going to stay jointly stay concentrated in just 1 or 2 shares of brka and trust that warren's successor can replicate the practically unheard of feat of outperforming the s&amp;p over decades? or, are they going to sell those brka shares and cash out? 

why would this next generation by brk just because it holds apple --- when they can just buy apple itself. this is something buffet has consistently said over the years. to paraphrase: ""berkshire trades at a premium and you can buy the stuff we buy and perform about the same.""

**finally. 1) if cook had these kind of groupies, what would you expect to happen to apple stock on cook's demise? 2) did you know any of this about warren/berkshire before i told you (anyone from omaha knows this stuff)?**

&gt; do you get to meet him weekly where he discusses his stock tips and views on his companies performance?

don't need to. although, wife was an investment accountant for one of his insurance companies. every so often i would get the ""i know something you don't know"" ... but she'd never tell me until i read about it in the paper. berkshire purchases through the insurance companies so i remember once - just to give a specific example - where the relatively small insurance my wife was at got orders to buy 10's of millions of coke at a moment's notices. not an easy thing to do given the regulatory requirements of insurance companies and also not an easy thing to keep quiet. i think only 2 people at my wife's insurance company knew the details for example (her and the top investment investment c level). but multiply this by dozens of insurance companies and there's a lot of potential for leaks. wife literally would not tell me for 90 days or something. i did, however, get consider stories about the extreme amounts of cash he kept on hand that they had to invest and account for.",1,,FatFiredProgrammer,0

[i get where your coming from, and framing it this way of incentivizing *investment* makes more sense. however, after the cultural phenomenon of yolo'ing came into existence, it's clear that having a small account size isn't necessarily going to prevent traders from gambling away their accounts on the riskiest of products.  now i don't know whether there's a way to 100% confirm this, but doesn't it make more sense that investment oriented traders likely would have gotten much more burned once the dot com bubble burst? aapl stock lost about 80% of it's value between march 2000 and the end of the year.   now sure it obviously all worked out for aapl shareholders in the end, but i have no doubt many who'd been in the stock for some time sold for a loss.  correct me if i'm wrong, but at the time there was no cultural phenomenon around making the riskiest of trades (yolo'ing), so i really have some questions about whether day traders suffered so much more than everyone else who would have lived through an 80% annual drop in aapl stock.](/r/stocks/comments/sv4juq/why_is_pdt_still_a_rule_the_secs_reason_of/hxe1ycd/)

1645279381,"so there are 2 main types of retirement accounts:

 1) 401k — this is controlled by your employer. if you decide to contribute, the money will be taken directly out of your paycheck and put in this account. some employers offer matching, where if you put $10 into this account, they’ll put an additional $10 in the account for you, but sounds like your employer doesn’t offer that so not relevant for you. 

2) ira (individual retirement account) — this is controlled by you. you go open it just like a bank account, lots of banks offer them. popular banks to use for this are fidelity, vanguard, schwab 


there are also 2 different ways to handle taxes in these accounts:

1) traditional: you do not have to pay taxes the money that goes into the accounts in the year you put it in. you do have to pay taxes on the money the year you take it out. 

2) roth: you do have to pay taxes on this money the year you put it into the account, but do not have to pay taxes on it the year you take it out. 

these account types and tax structures can be mixed and matched, but the most common 2 are traditional 401k (controlled by your employer, put money in without it being taxed) and roth ira (controlled by you, put money in that has been taxed) 


than once the money is in the account, you have to decide what to do with it. you want to invest it, to make sure it’s growing as fast as possible. so for example you could buy some apple stock, and then if apple does well, your money would grow. however, if apple does poorly, your money would decrease. 

a better plan is to invest in a bunch of companies—over time they will increase in value, without the risk of one company going out of business destroying your money. an index fund is the easiest way to do this. instead of buying stock in 1000 separate companies, you buy shares of the index fund, and they invest in those 1000 companies for you. a target date fund is even easier—you choose the one with the date near when you’re going to retire, and it automatically adjusts over time to make sure you’re getting the best risk/reward.",73,,15-37,0

1645302894,"nope.  but it's not luck...is it?

what the market does is..well...luck.  if you put all your money into dogecoin or apple stock or bonds issued by washington dc to build schools, you're subject to how that particular investment does.  (well dogecoin isn't an investment really, but lets set that aside).

by investing in broad investments, you lose the risk of apple going bankrupt.  but you're still subject to the variability of different investments.  i think we all agree that generally the stock market is the place to invest and that mutual funds are the best way to diversify inside the stock market.  you can also use mutual funds to diversify beyond just the stock market.  target date funds do that, and my previous post mentioned vasgx and vsmgx -- they both invest some in bonds (20% in vasgx; 40% in vsmgx).

2007 was the first big drop in the market starting the great recession.  in 9 months from the peak of my 401k in may 2007, my 401k dropped 40%.  it took 3 years to come back to the may 2007 peak...because i didn't panic; i didn't sell stock and put it into money market or bonds...  i let it ride--all because i trusted the strategy, and i had time to let the market recover.",1,,micha8st,0

1645310498,"ok, i take you at your word that you had no ill intentions.

i generally recommend caution when reading news articles from cnbc and the like.  they often don't give the full picture.

if a headline seems outrageous or really attention-getting, it almost always pays to investigate beyond the article.  sometimes, the errors or omissions of information are simply the result of the journalist themselves not knowing something.  other times, especially with opinion-oriented articles, there can be ulterior motives.

short-and-distort campaigns are real.  big investors will often use publications or connections with the media to spread misinformation in order to manipulate stock prices:

for example: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-224](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-224)

&gt;jurors in boston federal court today returned a verdict in the securities exchange commission’s favor against a hedge fund adviser and his investment advisory firm.  
&gt;  
&gt;gregory lemelson and massachusetts-based lemelson capital management llc were charged with fraud in september 2018 for reaping more than $1.3 million in illegal profits by making false statements to drive down the price of san diego-based ligand pharmaceuticals inc.  the sec’s evidence at trial showed that after establishing a short position in ligand through his hedge fund, lemelson made a series of false statements to shake investor confidence in ligand and lower its stock price, increasing the value of his fund’s position.

jim cramer also discussed market manipulation tactics on video: [https://youtu.be/gyapf6qxla8](https://youtu.be/gyapf6qxla8)

1645331536,"if you start a restaurant company with your life's savings of $100,000, use that money as a down payment on a building, kitchen equipment, tables, menus, and so on...then after a couple years your restaurant's successful and you decide to put your manager in charge of the place and retire to florida, *you still own the company*.  any profits the company generates above expenses and salaries are yours (although if you're keeping the restaurant properly separate from your personal assets -- *as you really should*, ask any lawyer -- the company will need to pay you in the form of a dividend, and some tax forms will need to be done -- ask any accountant).  if you come back from florida and don't like how the restaurant's being run, you can fire your manager.

a ceo is ""the boss,"" but he's actually just a manager, like in the restaurant story.  ""ceo"" is a title for a professional manager who runs a company for the benefit of its owners.

if the company is fully owned by one person, the owner of the company can fire the ceo.

if the company has multiple owners, the owners can vote to fire the ceo.  usually this vote is taken based on their percentage of ownership.  so if alice owns 40% of a company and bob, charlie, dan and eric each own 15% of the company, alice + any one of the minority shareholders would have votes representing over 50% of the company and be able to fire the ceo.  to override alice's decision about whether the ceo should be fired, the four minority shareholders would all have to vote together to have over 50% of the votes.

if the company has a large number of owners, the owners can vote directly on major issues, but it's a pain to coordinate -- for example, microsoft stock is likely owned by tens of thousands, or maybe hundreds of thousands of people.  each and every one of those people owns a tiny percentage of microsoft, and is entitled to participate in shareholder votes.

so companies with more owners than you can count on one hand will usually have a sort of ""representative form of government"" for the company, where the shareholders vote for a board of directors (on a one-share-one-vote basis).

the board of directors takes care of most routine matters, but a few shareholder votes are still needed.  the directors need to be elected; truly major decisions may need to be voted by all shareholders; and there's also often ""initiative and referendum"" style rules where shareholders can bring issues directly to their peers (the rest of the shareholders) and bypass the board of directors entirely.

if you own individual stocks, your online stockbroker probably routinely bombards you with messages about board elections and issues that you can vote on as a tiny part owner of whatever companies you own.

i say ""usually"" or ""often"" because the details can depend a lot on where the company is formed, where it does business, and the rules set up in the company's bylaws.  (the bylaws are the ""constitution"" set up when the company's formed.)",1,,white_nerdy,0

some people like to buy early.  that's great if you are investing for yourself. you can accept high risk and a possible loss of part or all of your capital.  but if you are investing for others, you are held to a higher standard.  and those investors are who actually moves stocks.  so understanding when they will start to buy is of benefit to early investors.  as you don't want to be selling high when that is when the big players just start to make their investments.  case in point:

years ago, in the early 2000's a money manager bought up apple stock because it was selling close to it's net cash of around $12, stock was at $14.  some people didn't thing apple as a survivor, they were losing money.  at that point the manager was the second largest holder of apple with about 5% of the outstanding shares.  after the introduction of the ipod, the stock hit $45.  they had tripled their money and as a value manager, they took their profit.  at the time they were managing around $30 billion of assets.  if they hadn't sold a share of apple today their 5% stake would be worth around $135 billion.  it's unlikely any manager would have held that much apple.  but today. they only manage around $700 million.

my point is the stock market is a big place.  their are $trillions invested, and billions moved daily.  there are managers who use various strategies to manage their risk and return.  some buy undervalued stocks, some buy growth.  i want to understand how they think so i have a better idea on how to manage my investment so i'm not selling too early or too late.",1,,Ask_Lou,0

1645405490,"let's do it with real market numbers thanks to robinhood's watchlist for options.

at 3pm on friday, nvda stock price is $240.17.  
at that same time, a 232.5 call would have sold for 13.10  
this leaves us with an initial profit of $543 per contract, which is only 2.26%, so less than the initial, but not bad for a weekly play, if the stock didn't tumble.

a put at that same strike would have cost 4.88, meaning the profit on call away is only $55, or a measly 0.2%, making this strategy no where near as lucrative and definitely in theta gang territory, actually worse. 

perhaps we buy the put at the true cost basis instead of the same strike. a 227.5 put would cost 3.50 at the same time, which increases the profit to $193, which would be a 0.8% return when the underlying ends the week a $227.5 or higher. this then becomes a baby bull play with the only risk being breaking even. if you account for margin, you could potentially do 2-4 of these trades with that same ""cash"" on hand, which in theory brings your weekly gain on cash to 1.6%-3.2%, which is probably still worth the stress free life if you have a year or two to do that with decent starting capital.

but, you are definitely right. this strategy is way less lucrative with in market numbers. thank you for being smarter than me.",1,,ShadyPenguinn,0

1645432963,"&gt;so here is the quick rundown for google. it’s currently 3 classes of shares. class a ($goog), class b (preferred) and class c (googl). both class a and class c should have the same value on the markets however the only difference is the class c ($googl) has 1x value of voting rights. this however is irrelevant as class b owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by page and brin. in short, not important.

not to be an ass, but you kinda lose credibility when you are seriously incorrect from the basic structuring of google.

googl is their class a shares. goog is their class c

class a and class c should not have the same value on the market, because of the fact their class a shares (googl) comes with 1x voting rights. (not their class c shares)

&gt;this however is irrelevant as class b owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by page and brin. in short, not important.

this is correct however. but it doesnt change the fact that googl should come with a small premium. (and it usually does). but for your average investor, your 1x voting rights with 0.0000000000001% ownership in google wont matter. so get the cheaper of the two.


also, their b class shares are not preferred stock. it's just another class of common shares that's structured to have 10x voting power

[i hold both.  personally, i think googl has the biggest moat in the faang - between its search, youtube, mobile os duopoly with apple, and one of the big three in the cloud space. plus, obviously, massive advertising revenue. it’s heavily in favour on reddit at present as it crushed earnings, and i like how many different verticals they’re trying to get into… though they’ve often fallen flat on innovations. either way, it’s a monster and will continue growing like one. the stock split will also likely drive up the share price.  sentiment is incredibly negative on fb at present, and it’s always been considered like a vice stock. the metaverse isn’t something i’m totally sold on, though a lot of large companies are throwing r&amp;d budgets at it. if it comes off, fb will be well-positioned. with it as beaten down as it is, i think there’s a lot of upside. the headwinds of apple and google’s advertising changes remain, but fb continues to turn massive profits.   declining active users on the fb platform itself is heralded as the end of days for the company, but… i don’t see it. while people do move on to newer platforms, fb itself has been incredibly sticky as a social media platform. likewise, instagram remains insanely popular. whatsapp may be harder to monetise, but it’s got a massive, active, user base. fb is also doing well with the oculus in the vr space. my biggest criticisms are really that they could be doing more to bolster their core business. reels to compete with tiktok is good, but i’d like to see them capitalise more on the marketplace feature / collaboration with shopify and similar; rather than having everything quite so focused on the metaverse.  in short, fb is the riskier play with greater headwinds, but has been oversold to the point it’s got a decent amount of upside potential. if it lands its metaverse gamble and/or finds a way to recover some of the advertising future earnings to be lost to privacy changes, it could be a really good long hold. googl will likely continue to grow consistently and churn profits. if it builds a moat in any of the various areas they’re focusing r&amp;d money, it will be a very nice upside.](/r/stocks/comments/swmx1b/5_year_bet_goog_or_fb/hxn14dx/)

1645451457,"i have done quite a bit of shorting. it is hard to find information (books, podcasts, etc) about shorting because its a small universe.. on top of that, bears tend to be solitary animals, while bulls run in herds. the same is true in the markets. i would recommend technical analysis of stock trends by magee and edwards. that's probably the most influential book i ever read

the first thing you need to understand is that shorting is a short term process, or in some cases, medium term. there really is no such thing as ""short and hold forever"".   its far better to short, cover, reshort, cover, etc on the way down.. .

this is because as the stock falls, its the opposite effect of going higher, with respect to compounding gains. as the stock falls, you have diminishing gains. for example, if i short 100 shares of stock x at $100.. as it falls, it requires a larger and larger percent decline to generate the same dollar return for me. this is the opposite of say, buying 100 shares at $10 and watching it climb to $100/share.

anyway, because its almost all short term and medium term, i have found technical analysis to be my primary tool.. find the downtrend, wait for a rally to the top end of the downtrend range, and short it. if the stock breaks out over the top end of the range, you stop out with a stop buy.  do not ride losers up, as your loses literally can go exponential .

i do use fundamental analysis however to pool my universe of money losing, over-priced stocks... i prefer to find shorts from that universe

i very rarely short any large cap stock in qqq or $spx due to passive investment flow from index fund investors. those stocks have a steady supply of buyers being pumped in all the times.

the exception is during periods like now, where i believe the indices are trending lower.. during times like these, the flow of money out of the index funds acts as a catalyst for the move lower... that's why i recently put on shorts in $nvda and $pfe

normally i would never short large cap profitable stocks

1645478456,"margins look great, revenue looks great and growing. just as you mentioned the good history, you can't ignore the bad history of stocks. historically speaking, no stocks with fundamentals like nvidia have ever sustained their high valuations. once they reach these high valuations, it's only downhill to correction territory. what is correction territory? only jesus knows.

&amp;#x200b;

**let's look at $nvda fundamentals:**

p/e ratio: 72.86 , p/s ratio: 24.63 , p/fcf: 83.53 , p/b ratio , 24.86

margins: gross 64%, operating 35%, net 32%

**for comparison, now qualcomm $qcom, a large cap semiconductor:**

p/e ratio: 19.84 , p/s ratio: 5.75 , p/fcf: 13.66 , p/b ratio , 18.95

margins: gross 57%, operating 29%, net 27%

**now, a small cap semiconductor company, skyworks $swks:**

p/e ratio: 14.67 , p/s ratio: 4.45 , p/fcf: 20.11 , p/b ratio , 4.20

margins: gross 49%, operating 31%, net 29%

**for giggles, lets do one more. intel $intc**

p/e ratio: 8.23 , p/s ratio: 2.37 , p/fcf: 10.79 , p/b ratio , 1.92

margins: gross 56%, operating 26%, net 27%

&amp;#x200b;

according to these numbers, and feel free to double check them, margins are all somewhat similar for these 3 semiconductor companies. seems like $nvda is 5x more expensive for similar industry values.

according to you:

&gt;demand massively outpaces supply, and demand will only increase with more and more innovation and iot

all these companies i mentioned, plus more, will benefit from iot, automotive, defense, industrial, etc. sectors. unless it's something i'm missing from $nvda, something that truly separates them from competition, to me, it will always be another hype stock.

now, i am not saying $nvda will go bankrupt as the business seems to be in good health. what i am saying is, historically speaking, $nvda will most likely see a huge drop back to industry fundamentals (80% drops) as opposed to another run up.

don't get me wrong. i'm not saying this is the most it will crash or if it will prop up again in the coming months. but if you're a ""long term investor"", i'd suggest waiting. overvalued stock right now, no doubt, despite whatever moat it may have if any.",14,,solovino__,0

1645490736,"this is a real moral question that i spent a lot of time thinking about yesterday.

let's say for a second that i *could* get a full refund if i cancel. i'm still not sure if i am compelled to. i might be. it's a tough one.

but lots of businesses to do feel morally compelled to cancel. and clearly, this is not an ethical standard in the (financial) economy.

insurance companies don't work like this. you don't get a refund if you don't get hurt.

similarly, business often times price their items to account for thefts and other 'losses' that come with running the business that don't take into account interactions with individual clients.

do i not have moral justification in doing the same thing?

let's say i operate my traveling 'like a business'. let's say my business' goal is to have somewhere to live for the next 2 months and my budget to make that happen is $2000.

if airbnb (or, in my argument, *whoever*) just screwed me out of $500, doesn't that mean that 'in order to keep my business afloat' i need to make up costs somewhere else? if i find on the market an opportunity that allows me to do that, why should i throw it back just because the person offering that opportunity didnt adequately prepare? did people who bought apple stock for a ten cents a share in 1982 (or whatever) give it back when it was $1000/share in 1998 because they got 'too good of a deal'? do people who buy rare coins/art for cheap prices without informing the seller of what it is worth have a moral burden to refund the seller? moreover, what if the seller has every opportunity to know what the babe ruth baseball card is worth and is just careless in looking it up in the price guide?? does the purchaser *still* have a moral responsibility to return the card?

a final question is: why does the responsibility to do what some may consider 'the right thing' become apparent when an individual is the agent, but remains hidden or even worse - obviously justified - when a group/business/corporation is the agent?

why, for example, is it more justifiable for aetna insurance to stay afloat by taking advantages where they are to be had in the market (never mind all kinds of other companies) than it is for a grad student trying to find a place to live after being out of work for 2 years?

[my take on tsla… first and foremost, i honestly believe it’s not going anywhere and in 10 years it will remain a top 5 us company. all of this being said, i don’t know that it will stay top 5 on the way there. yeah i know… it’s not just a car company, it’s ai, solar, energy, robotaxis, robots, insurance, you name it. the fact remains that today it’s 95% a car company that sells only 2 real cars, plus a handful of s and x vehicles. all other aspects of their business are either pipe dreams, years away from solo profitability, or regulatory nightmares. the long game is probably quite strong for tesla but the short game is tough. the way i look at it, it’s about a $900b company today, let’s ask what needs to happen to get it to $2t? i think a lot needs to go right over the next 5 years to get there. i think it does get to $2t or even $3t over time, but what is that time and risk worth for 2-3x upside that isn’t guaranteed. let me give you a real world example. i’ve been heavy in apple for a very long time. when they were a $1t company i sold a solid chunk of shares and diversified out into a lot of safer bets. today apple is a $3t company and those investments are up about 75% being diversified out. would i have made more staying put? sure but the risk wasn’t worth it. not sure how much of your portfolio is in tesla at $1100, but if it’s more than 20%, maybe consider why.](/r/stocks/comments/sxfvcy/i_bought_tsla_in_2021_should_i_sell_and_take_the_l/hxsjics/)

[unless you're a short term trader (read: gambler), you'd be a fool to sell tesla. for the first time in the company's history, it's starting to become cheaply valued if you account for growth, and the risks with the company are smaller than ever. tesla has never, not even back when it was $100 just before it shot up to $900, looked this appealing. the risk/reward at the current valuation is insane. imo the risk it goes down throughout this decade is close to 0, the chance it goes at least 3x is extremely large, there's still a very fair chance it goes 10x and if all the crazy ai stuff (fsd/tesla bot/autobidder/dojo) works out the upside is unimaginable.  all of that said, this is the risk of using margin. your decision is not whether you should sell tesla, but whether you should continue to be on margin. that has nothing to do with the company and everything to do with the meta and your mental wellbeing, and is exactly the reason why you should never use margin for (long term) investing.](/r/stocks/comments/sxfvcy/i_bought_tsla_in_2021_should_i_sell_and_take_the_l/hxthxgr/)

[nvda demand drivers are gaming, data centers, and crypto (altcoins).  gaming and datacenters both benefited from a pull-forward of demand during the pandemic.  crypto prices peaked in november 2021 and may fall a very long way depending on how that market reacts to non-negative real interest rates in usd, which we're probably going to need in order to get inflation under control.  overall point being, demand growth for nvda is set to slow.  next up is valuation.  their trailing-twelve-month peg ratio is about 3, which implies that growth is expected to accelerate, which is unlikely in a post-pandemic, high-inflation world.  any theoretical model of valuation like dcf would also include the effect of interest rates: when short-term rates go up, all investment assets except cash decrease in value because the risk-free alternative to them got better.  to put this in its crudest possible form, a p/e of 42 implies that nvda has an equity premium (over the 0% risk-free rate) of 2.4%.  if short term rates go to 2%, the same premium implies a p/e of 23, and a corresponding drop in price of over 40% *from the current price*.  the point is, this effect is **big** for growth stocks.  tl;dr: the fed and inflation will make or break nvda's fair value in the short/medium term no matter what anyone thinks about the long term.](/r/stocks/comments/sxfyqa/the_bubble_has_already_burst/hxvchug/)

[&gt;so here is the quick rundown for google. it’s currently 3 classes of shares. class a ($goog), class b (preferred) and class c (googl). both class a and class c should have the same value on the markets however the only difference is the class c ($googl) has 1x value of voting rights. this however is irrelevant as class b owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by page and brin. in short, not important.  not to be an ass, but you kinda lose credibility when you are seriously incorrect from the basic structuring of google.  googl is their class a shares. goog is their class c  class a and class c should not have the same value on the market, because of the fact their class a shares (googl) comes with 1x voting rights. (not their class c shares)  &gt;this however is irrelevant as class b owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by page and brin. in short, not important.  this is correct however. but it doesnt change the fact that googl should come with a small premium. (and it usually does). but for your average investor, your 1x voting rights with 0.0000000000001% ownership in google wont matter. so get the cheaper of the two.   also, their b class shares are not preferred stock. it's just another class of common shares that's structured to have 10x voting power  sources  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/052215/goog-or-googl-which-google-should-you-buy.asp  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classbshares.asp](/r/stocks/comments/sxlw9w/the_google_split/hxt8hn5/)

normally clients that come to us dont just have $50mm cash laying around. it could be tied up in real estate, some legacy low basis stock (maybe bought apple in the 90s) etc. a common strategy we pursue for them is to round out their portfolio so that it can gradually go from a concentrated portfolio of real estate/apple stock into a more diversified one.   


how is that done? it really depends on what we are working with. typically with iras they are great tax free vehicles to make adjustments in (instead of owning broad market exposure there, we would look for market ex-mega cap tech for example).  


so thats a very big picture example. more in the weeds is looking at their portfolio's active risk vs benchmark. we can look at the over/underweights in each sector, factor, country etc, and if there are red flags, we will do what is within our powers to remove the red flags (like being long lots of credit risk heading into this year...so thats incorporating our insights into actionable recommendations for clients). we want to be mindful of where there is absolute risk and relative risk (vs benchmark).

this new virtual internet might come at some point in the future made by someone else but whatever meta is making sounds like doa bullshit. if it will even exists as an actual working product. all we've seen is a couple of marketing videos like this one with obama, and shaq reading a script over the phone:

i'm sure everyone and their mother is going to sign up for this laughably pathetic crap. lol.

they're reaching. they certainly announced the metaverse but have no idea what to do with it and can't come up with reasons why people would use it.

at the time, apple was on the ropes. they were licensing macos to other manufacturers in order to remain relevant, and steve jobs was 6 months away from returning to the company after they bought next. apple shares were trading at about $.20. the consensus was that they were doomed.

regarding stocks vs crypto, i will start with saying i don't personally believe in crypto so i'm biased. when you buy a stock, you are buying something with a balance sheet and metrics that you can use to value it and judge if the stock is worth buying or not. looking at aapl, you're able to see how many phones/computers/ipad's they sold this year. you can see growth metric and how their healthy their balance sheet is. when you buy bitcoin, there are no metrics that can tell you if it's undervalued or overvalued and there's also a lot less transparency &amp; regulations in the industry. you can argue that you can price bitcoin based on the cost of electricity, which i think is a valid argument. to me though it's just pure speculation. they also are more volatile typically when comparing to solid companies in the s&amp;p/dow.

1645568890,"pltr is going through an s curve. slow adoption and growth at first (government contracts only) and are now breaking into commercial sector (nato alliance only).

the share based comp dilutes the share price but it’s pretty interesting seeing the misunderstanding people have. the float has gone up because the company is using its stock as a currency to pay out for talent. 

the company has actually had minimal share issuance since their direct listing, as a matter of fact, even the sbc is slowing down year over year. 

the company is 424m positive free cash flow, no debt, and has a stable foundational client with government contracts. so if you think the shares will go to $0, then perhaps you dont understand what holding equity truly means. there’s almost zero chance of bankruptcy risk where debt holders wipe equity holders and the company is taken over by debt holders. because there’s no debt… 

so depending on one’s stomach for volatility, you can buy and own a unique company that has the track record for execution, at the highest and national security levels of demanding.

this is a long hold and see how they grow their commercial side of the business. the nearest competitor people assume is snowflake, but snowflake might not be the one. instead, i believe it’s $crm. they are slowly taking over every silo of enterprise software/data. crm, project management, slack, workday (via partnership), etc. the vision is to have a unified system where every application sends through a stream of data for analysis on one platform. $crm is trying to do this by being that unified vendor.

i believe the opposite to be the real future, that pltr foundry is the unified platform wrapping all enterprise apps and collecting the streams of data for analysis.

so it’s either a 90% haircut (not 100% because there’s no bankruptcy risk) or a 20x return based on dcf modeling from these levels, as the company grows through its high growth segment of s curve.

people really allow price action to dictate their narrative, but stock prices doesn’t always follow product development and adoption here. as wallstreet analysts aren’t systems engineers. eps has nothing to do with how the pltr platform is being deployed and used by new customers who signed multi million dollar deals. i would change my hypothesis if i have facts that show customers are dumping the core product after several years of deployment and usage, but i have not seen that. quite the opposite with how sticky they are.

it’s a good risk/return bet for me, but if you can’t stomach the volatility, go buy $goog or $aapl. (which i also own a lot of as well)",65,,gqreader,0

1645576231,"well, because for the most part, it's easier to give feedback on a ticker.

most companies you wouldn't need to google in the first place are easily identifiable by ticker/abbreviation (goog, aapl, msft, tsla, fb, etc etc etc).

if i start talking about bwa or borgwarner, most people probably don't know the company anyways and are gonna need to search it. since this is an investment sub, people are more likely to mainly care about the financial aspect. searching by ticker makes this process easier. especially because as you note, you're trying to rate a portfolio. i haven't the foggiest what apple's p/e is. if i write ""apple"" into chrome, i first need to delete all the suggestions about apple id and whatnot, and i'll just get irrelevant results. or i need to write ""apple stock"". or i could just type aapl and the most relevant financial info appears straight in my browser (including the company name!), i don't even need to click a link.

finally, a company might have different tickers, which not necessarily are perfectly linked. bristol-myers squibb, for example, has bmy (the actual stock) and bmy.rt (a contingent value stock). bmy.rt is vastly more volatile and risky, working a bit more like an option than normal stock.",1,,Psychological_Top827,0
1645576659,"okay, but when i am buying a stock i am not paid a dividend because i owning a stock allows the company to operate. 

everyone can sell apple stock or can sell coke and the stock could go to 0 but there is intrinsic value because the goods and services they produce and sell to consumers. they then use that money to reward shareholders. 

the ""dividend"" you're talking about relies on people using the crypto for the sake of using crypto whether it's that they are speculating or actually using it as currency. but we have seen nobody uses crypto for currency besides stablecoins. 

so when the speculating dries up and nobody is using any crypto, besides possibly usd-c, can you tell me where the yeild is going to come from for staking?

because apple is not relying on people buying and trading their stock to pay a dividend. they sell hardware and software. they are producing real goods and services people want and that people need. i can't think of anything crypto can do that would generate nearly as much value besides trying to circumvent laws like money laundering.",4,,mussedeq,0

1645589509,"what are the interest rates on the loans? what is the total amount of the loans? is your money in the brokerage account currently invested or have you already sold?

there are a few things you can take into consideration here. if the money is invested first off, selling the investment to pay the loans will make you responsible for any potential taxes on any gains. depending on the dollar amount &amp; the amount of gain, you might still owe taxes. holding it for a year means its long term gains instead of short term. long term gaints is a lower rate, but still taxable. so again, depending on the dollar amount this is possibly something you will owe taxes on. if you are not too sure if you fall into a category where you owe taxes, sit down with a tax person and get some more details about your specific situation.

secondly, on paper at least, you might come out ahead if you keep your money invested and pay off the loans slower if the interest rate is low. for example, the average return in the market is roughly 10% per year (over a long period of time). if your loans are at 3% interest, on paper at least you are earning more by keeping money in the market than you lose by keeping the loan open. then again, this is considering the average return on the market as a whole over a long period of time. if your money is all invested in msft stock, one single company will not likely get the same average as the whole market does so it is harder to predict or estimate a future return. 

third, your personal feelings about debt matter. if you hate debt and want to be out of debt asap, paying it off is still a good move. even if it is not the best potential move out there, it is still a smart move in general.

so tl;dr if the debt is a low interest rate, you theoretically come out ahead by leaving the money invested in the market, but that is not a 100% guarantee, and paying off debt is always a good move, even if it is not the best move possible.",3,,Not-a-Banker,0

[i used to run a fantasy baseball league with a pot that regularly ran up to $3000. i actually learned a lot about picking value as a result. what i've learned is that going against the grain is the best strategy for potentially big gains. so when everyone is a run on closers, i'm looking at the best hitters available. when there is a run on catchers, i'm looking for the best pitchers. you still need  studs to anchor your team aapl, goog, etc. but you also need to pick some little guys who will eventually become studs on your team. when a player is hot and it doesn't seem like he can keep it up, i'd sell him for a struggle player. that's how you win and i view the stock market very similarly.](/r/stocks/comments/syf4u1/statistically_speaking_you_cant_beat_the_market/hy05hqi/)

[again, getting burned back then (despite having recovered by leaps and bounds since) left a mark. maybe because it was because it happened during my formative years. either way, i distinctly remember a lot of the same rhetoric; that's why i put significant fractions of my portfolio into established blue chip techs such as csco and intc. i also remember the same talk about share values reflecting really optimistic future growth numbers, as if the only alternative was total and complete bankruptcy (which is just such a poor model of the outcomes that i don't even know where to start).   i've been an aapl shareholder since like 95/96; i've made a metric ton of gains on that investment. it doesn't mean i really trust that the share price will stay over like $160 (i expect it to fall back to $130-145 because i *know* that sooner or later their growth rates will fall, especially in the face of the semi shortage, and previously over-exuberant investors are going to punish them for it). you might ask; why don't you sell and rebuy? the answer is simple; it's a very significant position that i will incur an equally significant tax bill on. the tax bill might honestly eclipse the price difference, leaving me in the red just for the sake of doing some (what i see as) bullshit trading.  disclosure: as mentioned, i hold shares of csco, intc, aapl](/r/stocks/comments/sxfyqa/the_bubble_has_already_burst/hxyepxw/)

everyone seems to believe one of two things:

* companies that pay dividends underpeform the market

the first point is completely untrue. companies, at least successful ones, are flush with cash and often have no real use for it. microsoft, a dividend paying stock since 2004, is able to both pay that out as well as do share buybacks...and acquisitions...oh, and **grow** 

obviously i already listed an example of one but here's another...$avgo. looking at 1,601% return on that dividend grower. i own both companies mentioned, as a disclaimer.

frankly, the only thing that makes sense to me about why so many investors hate dividends is that they aren't patient. they'd rather see their tickers shoot up 25%, sell for short term capital gains, and then crow about it. unfortunately though, too many investors make the wrong picks for these ""growth stocks"" and throw money at junk like baba or draft kings and bleed their portfolios instead.",9,,RushingJaw,0

1645643685,"i mean you kind of skipped the entire argument i've made. in order to get your meal at mcdonalds, you need to physically be in the drive through or store, or involve the employees in the store location to make your food (thinking of door dash, even if you do mobile ordering an employee in the physical location needs to process your food). there is no distribution warehouse that mcdonalds runs that can get you your food in a reasonable time frame, and consumers would not tolerate the change.

at apple, if you buy your phone from the carrier, through costco/target/walmart, you order it online, you literally go anywhere else but the apple store to buy your phone, you never, n.e.v.e.r interact with an apple store employee. they are non-essential to the sales process if the consumer chooses not to go to an apple store.

mcdonalds needs front line employees to make the food. apple does not need apple store employees to sell products. they have tons of other retail channels to move product, and provide service on that product.

next part, tim &amp; friends aren't going to say ""oh, you're unionized? time to close everything down"" - come on, get a grip dude. most of apple's sales come from marketing - a lifestyle, a product, whatever. you really think apples pr team is going to let tim fire the entire apple store team all at once? get a grip. that, sorry, is a dumb argument.

they're going to either start phasing out stores, or when theres a bad quarter the c-suite will say in an investor news release that they are starting to close apple stores to help reign in costs.

nothing happens overnight, and yeah, the 1 correct thing you said - it would be a pr disaster if they did fire everyone. but you are forgetting the company you're dealing with. 70% of american teenagers use iphones. apple has successfully sold a generation of young adults on the life style from marketing and exclusivity. they will figure out how to remove people from the company in a manner that appeases shareholders (which, by definition of a public company, their sole purpose is to serve the shareholders (which i disagree with but thats for another day)), and masks the shutdowns from the public eye. they control enough of the media, or have enough ties in the media, to squash the stories before they appear. they have the financial backing to have stories conveniently not appear. every 401k, every pension plan, almost every bundled investment you buy has apple stock in it. there's an incentive for major players to keep status quo.

i'll end on this because i've spent way too much time on this, but i emplore you to look up ""defunctland: the craziest party walt disney ever threw"". defunctland goes through the history of primarily disney, and its road to success. i won't spoil it, its a good watch, but walt disney at the start of disney animation studios really enjoyed working with his animators and, he thought, paid them very well. gave them perks and tried, what he thought was his best, to give them opportunity and growth.

when the animators decided to strike, it broke walt. walt grew resentful of the animation studio and eventually abandoned them entirely to go work on the theme parks. he didn't care about the animators anymore and thus treated them with no respect. the difference here is that walt knew that he needed the animation studio to continue to keep driving profit so he could work on his parks; that and with the ips the team was making he could use them to theme his park.

tim cook and the c-suite, i believe, will follow the same route. except this time, tim and friends don't need the apple store employees to stay in business and create ip. they are free to remove them as it makes business and pr sense.",1,,Onekill,0

[so they have a similar vision. but different approaches and segments.  $crm is buying out or building out each silo of enterprise application they can to build their “unified platform”. but it’s sort of cobbled together if i’m being honest. like via m&amp;a or building partnerships.   where as pltr is native ground up build to connect all enterprise apps and sources of data streams into one operating system platform, foundry.  both know that if you break down the silos, you can find ghost patterns, correlation, and other actionable opportunities. but the issue is… it’s hard as hell to do it when there’s 5-6 applications and sources of data to filter through, how does one go and make sense of it. plus if you start hunting for it, people only hunt for what they sort of understand and have a logical inclination for. ie, logical relationship between two factors. vs how does the weather dropping in one part of the country, ordering going up, affects the follow quarters vol demand on the other side of the country. it’s random as fuck (as it appears) and an analyst will never have that level of hunch.  those insights and patterns are random and illogical and sort of stupid, but if it works when the company increases capacity and optimizes sales in that instance, is it really stupid?   both companies see the value in being the “single source of truth”, both approach it differently, $crm is hands down a cult in the medium/large business segment. the application is widely used.  pltr can’t scale down to small or medium biz yet. too much labor needed to deploy. so it’s all deployment game right now. whereas crm has farming account managers farming for more revenue from client base](/r/stocks/comments/syvlns/palantir_isnt_a_palatable_stock_even_after_its/hy24v2f/)

1645707391,"[i'm not bearish in the sense that i think we're about to enter a massive recession, but i am nervous about the strength of the economy going forward. i think a minor recession is absolutely on the cards and i see no reason to be bullish right now.  it appears we're seeing a broad rerating of valuations which is something that hasn't happened since 2018. in 2018 we had a large selloff followed by a rapid recovery thanks to the fed's u-turn. this time the u-turn isn't happening so my guess is that the market pe multiple will drop to around 18-20 and it will remain at those levels going forward. there will be no recovery this time and we'll just have to wait for earnings to push the market higher. i also think it's quite likely we don't see new highs this year. pe's have been elevated since 2019 in my opinion because investors felt confidence that there would be a fed put to save them whenever markets sold off. without that i think we have to revert back to pre-2018 valuations.  i suspect we have another 10-20% to go on the s&amp;p500 and i don't think we've seen the worst of the selling yet, but i could be wrong. i'd look for a bottom when aapl falls 4-5% in a day and everyone is convinced there will be a recession. i'm not seeing people flee from safety yet and most people still seem to be broadly constructive on markets which wouldn't typically suggest a bottom.  but who knows. anything can happen. i could be underestimating the likelihood of a fed put and that would change everything.](/r/stocks/comments/sz34c2/why_im_bullish/hy4du8g/)

[you're not really helping the company much by buying their stock except for helping raise the price, but you're not buying $aapl to help it grow or give it the 160. when stocks ipo, they have a set amount of shares they can sell and that's when the company will get their big bag of $$ usually. from then on they can look to sell more shares in a secondary offering, but you're not going to really help the company itself.   regarding stocks vs crypto, i will start with saying i don't personally believe in crypto so i'm biased. when you buy a stock, you are buying something with a balance sheet and metrics that you can use to value it and judge if the stock is worth buying or not. looking at aapl, you're able to see how many phones/computers/ipad's they sold this year. you can see growth metric and how their healthy their balance sheet is. when you buy bitcoin, there are no metrics that can tell you if it's undervalued or overvalued and there's also a lot less transparency &amp; regulations in the industry. you can argue that you can price bitcoin based on the cost of electricity, which i think is a valid argument. to me though it's just pure speculation. they also are more volatile typically when comparing to solid companies in the s&amp;p/dow.    to finalize my rant, i would recommend that if you want to be involved in the market and don't fully understand it, or follow it, to just buy some index tracking etf's. you can dollar cost average them (you put in ""x"" every month consistently. some months you'll buy more others less, but you'll average out a good cost over time). if you do want to try buying single names that's fine but please do your research and buy things you believe in. i tell anyone who asks me for stock advice to buy companies they use frequently and think will be around in 20 years. don't follow the crowds to try and get a quick buck, you might win but you'll more than likely lose. also, re-invest dividends. the compounding after a couple years will surprise you and it's easy to do on your brokerage usually. good luck in the market!](/r/stocks/comments/syx9nk/what_value_do_i_bring_by_buying_stocks/hy0r0in/)

and, considering that margin is probably like 5%, you would only need $2.5b to sell $50b worth of silver - that's a percent of a percent of the position that warren buffet has in just apple stock. given the percentage drop today, i bet the shorts made a few billion dollars off this drop with not much risked. it seems like a big short, but the kind of money needed to short silver and gold today is back page news for any major bank or hedge fund.

it's all just paper. this game won't end in the futures markets - it will end when your lcs has no silver to sell. the streets is where the price will skyrocket. forget the paper price.

edit: also, the hunt bro's were assholes. they tried to corner the silver market by going long with $1b, an then standing for delivery thinking that the silver would not show up. $6b worth of silver bars got delivered to their door step, and they didn't have the money to pay for it, so they had to borrow that much from the exchange's bank. the systemic risk created by this loan lead the exchange leaders to basically stop trading. they aren't heroes. some other assholes in the 20th century tried this with onions and potatoes forcing a lot of fresh produce in the bin.",5,,Due-Resolve-7391,0

1645773882,"&gt;what? isn't investment risky. i get it that they pay experts to invest their money but it's still risk.

common misconception by those who don't have lot of money in investment markets. investing in sufficiently diverse portfolio is essentially risk free (unless us government is overturned by ww3 but what is changes of that happening and if that happens losing bit of money is least of your problems).

when you think of investing you think of buying example apple stock. if apple sells more phones your investment rises but if they lose market share you lose money. but when rich buy stock they buy both apple and samsung. if apple loses market share then samsung wins market share. investor wins no matter what happens. this is eli5 of diversified portfolio but topic is much more complex. point still is investments are not risky.

&gt; they might sacrifice less -- they don't technically sacrifice less

do you notice what kind of mental gymnastics you have to do to justify this to yourself? you're constantly trying to find way to fix this leaking ship of an argument. there is contradictions all over your writing. you admit that risk is lower for rich but it must be somehow justified that they get more money.

rich have access to free money making machine where they don't have to risk or sacrifice anything. poor people can't afford to engage with this system and even if they invest all their money they won't see a fraction of the returns rich people do. no matter how smart or talented of investors poor are they just cannot get the same results.

my family’s situation wasn’t too bad growing up, but money was tight, and as an adult i’ve had times where i was struggling to buy food and couldn’t buy my meds. i need a few hundred in physical cash + 1-2k buffer in checking, and a solid stockpile of dry and frozen food, hygiene things, and meds to feel secure.",3,,vvwwwvvwvwvwvw,0

those investible assets are the ""underlying"" assets used in the leveraged product.

because you mentioned etoro - i imagine you are likely outside the us and in the eu. in the eu, there are also leverage products in the form of cfds available. those types of cfd products are not legal in the us. but cfds are a common leveraged product used, albeit extremely risky because of how they work. - one criticism of cfds is that the counterparty is a broker which would normally be considered a conflict of interest.",1,,greytoc,0

in short:  
they buy oil contracts that are due at a certain point in time.   
if oil prices go up, their price can go up but not necessarily.   
lets assume they hold contracts on a rolling 12m basis.   
first of all, that means that it is more relevant for the etf what the price is in the next 12 month than in the current month.   
second, that also means there is a high risk as the etf will have to replace the march 22 contract before march 22 ends with a new contract as it cannot physically take the delivery of the oil.  
this is a big difference to other etf! if the apple stock falls, the etf can just sit on it and wait for better times. a commodity etf has to sell under cost as it cannot physically take delivery of the oil!   


incasing prices can also lead to a situation called contango. i suggest you read and understand how that works and influences commodity etf that don't hold the actual commodity but futures.

this forced bill to grow the gates foundation until it did the opposite of depopulation in africa as an alibi for not trying to kill everyone.  using processing power from windows automatic updates, bill gates perfected his sars virus and created covid 19, certain everyone would get covid or his “vaccine”,

[as an american who lives in taiwan and having worked in the semiconductor industry for over 25 years some comments on this topic. first most of the media and the talking heads don’t seem to articulate that fab is only one small portion of how a chip gets made. you have lots of other pieces of the supply chain that even intel is dependent on based in taiwan. so you lose taiwan you pretty much lose the entire chip supply chain period. no semiconductor company will be able to operate at anywhere close to capacity. second most of the tech industry is reliant on chips from tsmc and other suppliers including testing packaging etc in taiwan. so apple, msft, google, etc will all come to a grinding halt in their production lines. so will most of the auto industry, tv industry, cable industry, satellite industry etc. finally some little known other industries like e-bikes and even regular bikes. taiwan has the largest bike component manufacturing in the world. so if you are betting in the market that china attacks taiwan you have to be prepared for a 50+% drop in stocks. the russian market drop will seem like a nothingburger in comparison. intel will probably drop the same as any other tech company. because every single one is exposed to taiwan in one way or the other for critical portions of their supply chain.](/r/stocks/comments/t0rrsn/if_china_ends_up_trying_to_invade_taiwan_wouldnt/hydtvrh/)

another option is just to see if one or two people wants to roll game roulettes only for a bit to get those characters. they could probably get a bunch of genshin characters - and maybe some other popular game characters they're interested in, like mario, 2b, etc - and they can trade them for stuff they would have gotten if they were still rolling animanga roulettes.

tldr: no way to easily do what you say. you have to use $m or $w or $h, but using mode 2 with $limroul can make the negative effects of this way less drastic than it would be in mode 1.",2,,perfectauthentic,0

[as an american who lives in taiwan and having worked in the semiconductor industry for over 25 years some comments on this topic. first most of the media and the talking heads don’t seem to articulate that fab is only one small portion of how a chip gets made. you have lots of other pieces of the supply chain that even intel is dependent on based in taiwan. so you lose taiwan you pretty much lose the entire chip supply chain period. no semiconductor company will be able to operate at anywhere close to capacity. second most of the tech industry is reliant on chips from tsmc and other suppliers including testing packaging etc in taiwan. so apple, msft, google, etc will all come to a grinding halt in their production lines. so will most of the auto industry, tv industry, cable industry, satellite industry etc. finally some little known other industries like e-bikes and even regular bikes. taiwan has the largest bike component manufacturing in the world. so if you are betting in the market that china attacks taiwan you have to be prepared for a 50+% drop in stocks. the russian market drop will seem like a nothingburger in comparison. intel will probably drop the same as any other tech company. because every single one is exposed to taiwan in one way or the other for critical portions of their supply chain.](/r/stocks/comments/t0rrsn/if_china_ends_up_trying_to_invade_taiwan_wouldnt/hydtvrh/)

1645990832,"don’t cave. average home values rose $45k last year and are expected to rise as much this year. if you sell to him now at his initial offer price he’ll make you look and feel foolish by the end of this year. 

i tell my clients that buying a home is an investment. it’s not as simple as exchanging a home someone else owns for one that you own. your wealth in the form of money and time is tied up in that house and you should do whatever you can to protect it. it is your right. yes, you can make an allowance for family but not to the degree the bil expects. 

keep this in mind: should you sell the house at the price the bil wants he’ll quickly realize he can flip it for a huge profit and use your wealth for his own gain — bigger house or newer house and new toys like boats and high-end electronics. 

here is the advice i’d give if you were my client:

1. get an appraisal. the cost of an appraisal is 0.1% the estimated amount you’d lose selling the home for $65k. then you can make an informed decision on your investment. (i’m not shouting. just highlighting how you need to appropriately change the language you use with your wife and bil.) if the bil gets a loan, he’ll have to get an appraisal so he will know exactly what the home is worth. i don’t know your state but assume he won’t have to reveal the appraisal so you can see the value. getting your own appraisal protects you. would you liquidate your 401k without at least checking your latest statement? no. know what the property’s market value is and negotiate from a position of parity. 

2. maybe don’t tell anyone about the appraisal. then, ask the bil for an insane amount of money so you can make an investment. tell him you want to get some bitcoin or apple stock. note his response. be serious with your request. he won’t waste time saying no. ask for $40k. don’t mention the house. just ask for financial help to build you investment portfolio and observe. when he says no, ask why he won’t help you. use the same counter arguments he has used re: the house.

ask him how much he’d sell his car for then lowball him on an offer price. note his reaction. 

3. ask the bil if he’d agree to not sell the home for a period of time after purchase. the reason is you don’t want to look and feel like a fool if the bil flips the home for massive gain. remember, home values are expected to rise so if he buys now then waits until later in the year he could make profit on top of the equity he’ll have. he doesn’t even have to sell the home to benefit financially. he could do a cash out refinance loan to pay off existing debt, and maybe do work on the home before selling it. he’ll benefit and you won’t. 

4. money is powerful and could lead to huge impacts in your family’s relationships if you get this wrong. there’s middle ground. you just need to find it. don’t allow emotion to completely control this. you could even get a listing agent to do a cma for you for free - comparative market analysis. get a cma and an appraisal. get your ducks in a row first then you can have a serious discussion with bil. 

5. dm me if you want to chat about this. seriously, re-frame the discussions in terms of “wealth” and “investment” and you’ll help everyone to hopefully understand there’s a lot more at play in this potential deal. put off discussions until 1. you have an appraisal and 2. talk to a real estate agent and get a cma.

edit: mortgage loan estimates are only good for 10 days. after that, lenders aren’t beholden to the terms initially disclosed to borrowers. your bil is asking for you to hold firm to a price offered 3 years ago. nope. also, appraisal value aren’t useable for mortgages anywhere from 120 to 180 days after the date of inspection. ask bil if he’d be okay using an appraised value based on february 2019 market data to sell his any of property in 2022.",1,,J-Skibby,0

1646001011,"hi everyone - i've recently started to evaluate my app situation in an effort to achieve digital minimalism and realized that my personal app habits are all over the place. i currently am up to my ears in the apple ecosystem, but i work in a place that uses windows based machines, with some slight google aspirations. i'm personally someone that like to separate my work from my personal accounts, so i seem to have a noah's ark style app setup where i have two email apps, two messaging apps, two cloud storage apps, etc. and it's just getting overwhelming trying to keep up with everything separate the way it is.

i'm aiming to combine these accounts into one smooth setup where everything ""works,"" but now i'm somewhat overwhelmed with indecision regarding using the stock apple suite of apps (mail, iwork, calendar, etc.) and other third party alternatives that often lock features behind some subscription paywall (fantastical vs. ical, carrot vs. weather, drafts vs. apple notes, overcast vs. podcasts etc.). i know that these apps may be overkill, but there are some people that really evangelize certain app alternatives as “the way” that it makes me pause for a bit. i don’t necessarily mind paying a subscription for an app or service that i’ll use that makes my life easier, but the baked-in apple apps are generally functional to say the least. i just worry about putting all of my eggs in one digital basket. 

i've also heard rumblings (or grumblings) that icloud is not as secure as it leads on - i've heard of people's files just disappearing, for example. so do a majority of you use onedrive? google one? dropbox? just looking for some suggestions.

obviously, i think migrating to the apple stock apps is probably the way to go, but if you're someone that evangelizes one app over a stock one i'd be curious to hear your thoughts. i also intend on staying with apple forever unless they obviously do something horrible as a corporation, and the windows/google alternatives just don't seem as appealing to me since they're clunky and in some cases fairly obtuse. 

current setup:

facebook is actually a perfect example of what's wrong with ethereum. they follow the ""move fast and break things"" ideology too; in fact, they first popularized it. the reason that doesn't work is that you only find security vulnerabilities after the fact. don't believe me, though, just look at the $10.5b/year worth of hacks that happen on the ethereum-dominated crypto ecosystem that you always see people posting about. for that matter, do you know how often facebook gets hacked because of the approach that zuckerberg popularized?

&gt; who are the editors and reviewers of those journals ? what are their contributions to the crypto space ?

if you're going to ask me what it is that makes acm credible -- [acm](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization) being the largest community-driven organization of cs researchers in the whole fucking world -- then i don't see the point of continuing the conversation on this front. please, for the love of god, open and try to unbiasedly ingest the information in the links i'm trying to send you.

&gt; often times, private sectors are much ahead of academics sectors. just being more academic doesn't mean it's better. it means you're just academic pretentious.

the irony is that tcp/ip, as in the basis of the internet that we're using to have this fucking conversation, was built by the academic sector that you're shitting on. look up vinton cerf and bob kahn (researchers at ucla and princeton respectively, who discovered the protocol) to see what i'm talking about.

sure, internet companies like facebook made more money off these protocols (as denominated in usd), but if that's what you care about, then go to r/wallstreetbets and buy calls on apple stock, because apple has more market cap than this entire industry put together. i'm here because i believe in the propensity of tech to solve many of the problems in geopolitics and the global financial system that we face today, not so that i can get impressed with the first guy who makes me a buck.",-1,,tldrthestoryofmylife,0

and i don't touch cryptocurrency it doesn't have a long enough track record for me to feel comfortable with investing in it. due to the decentralized nature of crypto i don't have confidence in it as viable in the long term. it reminds me a lot of the dot-com boom and bust of the 90s and early 00s in terms of historical hype. you had things like the cue cat, and desktop buddies, and browser game producers  that were taking in massive investments over the short term but bankrupting themselves. the cue cat fizzled, no one asked if it was truly viable in the long term, it was new and shiny and for the internet. that's all it took for people to throw money at it. just replace cue cat with nft and internet with blockchain and you get what i mean. all i'm seeing is a hype train that has little long term viability in crypto. the block chain is useful for many things but as it's being used i feel it's not wise to place an investment in it yet. cryptocurrency itself is another can of worms that is less than likely to remain viable in the long term as there is no oversight to actually ensure it conforms to it's stated goals. it's a digital product with nothing physical backing it's value. as an investor that's a red flag to me. i want something tangible backing the perceived value of an investment. crypto is built on something utterly intangible, mathematics, that has no physical translation for perceived value because it is impossible to make something tangible from it's components.",1,,Imnotreal77,0

[that's funny you would say that about aapl because after it gained 4x (edit 7x i meant) over 4 years, it lost 50% from the year 2012 to 2013; it took 2 years to recover.  (https://i.imgur.com/lbmd51s.png)  if you had aapl stock in 2011 and 2012, with a rebalancing system, then you would have been able to use those gains rather than losing them for 2 whole years.  if you have a system, then treat all your stocks the same, if not, then the system isn't a good system.  update:  i added the source pic](/r/stocks/comments/t10vig/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_feb/hyf6pno/)

if there is a sign of slower growth or even regression, why shouldn’t the investor look into other companies to invest their money in. i doubt many want to invest to see their investment lose value

and also another perspective, it can be also people invested in apple because they see potential future big returns on investment. that means the stock is up a lot since a lot of people invested. having a few slower growth quarters can mean people sell for other investments, which means apple stock can return to a lower, more reasonable valuation. a nice correction in stock price.",49,,JukeLuke,0
