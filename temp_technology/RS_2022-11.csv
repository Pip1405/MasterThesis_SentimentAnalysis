The cloud and productivity segments are still growing quite fast, while the personal computing division seems to be shrinking a bit.  

Overall, the company should deliver low double digit revenue growth for the full fiscal year.  There are many bright spots for the company, such as LinkedIn growing to over 875 million users and the company buying back a lot of its stock over time.  

While this stock may beat the market, it is unlikely to be a multibagger at this point because of its current valuation, sitting at around 27 times free cash flow, and 24 times earnings.

1667751796,meta stock analysis and valuation - is michael burry right?,"This week's casual valuation is Meta (formerly known as Facebook), a company that's down almost 50% over the last 5 years and over 75% since its all-time high back in September 2021.

As always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into a few segments:

1. What is Meta?
2. How to value Meta?
3. Historical financial performance and assumptions about the future
4. Valuation
5. Is Reality Labs that bad?
6. The different scenarios

**What is Meta?**

Meta doesn't really need any introduction, everyone knows their main products (Facebook/Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp), but what caused the decline in recent years is the change of their vision from these apps (that are known as ""Family of Apps"") to the metaverse idea (known as ""Reality Labs"").

**How to value Meta?**

Since one of the goals of this post is to value Meta, the question is, how to value these two operating segments?

The ""Family of Apps"" is the cash-generating machine, and there's a decade of financial data available to understand how it has performed when it comes to revenue and operating margin.

However, the second part is what brings the uncertainty in here. Regardless of the model used to value the ""Reality Labs"", the inputs/variables are too uncertain to create anything that's reasonable.

For that reason, I decided to take a different approach. I'll value the mature segment, the ""Family of Apps"" and compare that with the current market cap to understand what the market thinks of the metaverse and how much it prices it at.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's get started!

**Historical financial performance &amp; assumptions about the future**

Over the last 5 years, the ""Family of Apps"" grew revenue over 100% to over $115b for the last twelve months (ending September 2022). The operating margin of over 40% has been nothing but impressive.

Looking at the analysts' forecasts, they're expecting the revenue to grow around 5% during 2023 and over 10% during 2024. I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period.

However, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high.

When it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&amp;D being poured in.

Using a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of ""Family of Apps"" is around **$417b**.

**Valuation**

Now, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine ""Family of Apps"".

But there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied.

If the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**.

The current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea.

Is something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran:

""If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook &amp; complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian &amp; whining about your privacy being invaded.""

**So, what can be done?**

Well, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option.

**Is Reality labs that bad?**

This is a question that will be answered a decade from now.

Mark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the ""Family of Apps"".

So, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly.

Since 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment.

**The Michael Burry tweet**

The great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many.

One of his tweets was, ""Seems Meta has a New Coke problem."". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted.

I wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means.

Back in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was ""smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour"". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi.

What followed was 5,000 angry phone calls  per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year.

This means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.

Could he be wrong? Absolutely!

There's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the ""Reality Labs"" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not.

**The different scenarios**

What if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the ""Reality Labs"" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point.

What if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today.

As for me, I have 1 share in Meta, just to be entertained by what's coming next.",77,88,k_ristovski,ValueInvesting

1668436212,should investors buy apple stock right now?,"Apple stock has seen a slump just like the rest of the market, but it has not fallen nearly as much as many other stocks.  

The business faces some challenges as iPhones, which make up 40% of the company's sales, are experiencing slower growth, and there is fear that in a recession, consumers will wait longer to upgrade their devices.  

One aspect of the business countering this slowdown is the rapid growth of the company's subscription and service revenue.  

Although Apple share's don't look undervalued from a short term perspective at 22 times forward earnings, in the long run, the company's stock is likely to perform well.

1668609014,mastercard stock - dcf valuation and analysis,"Mastercard stock has performed well over a long period of time, but has been relatively sideways and on somewhat of a downtrend in recent months.  When performing a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis on a stock, we can use historical numbers in the business's financial statements in order to predict future performance of the business, and thus see if the stock is undervalued or overvalued.

With assumptions that revenue will grow in the mid double digits, gross margins will stay elevated at 78%, and the company has a weighted cost of capital at 9%, the intrinsic value of the shares in the present is around $279.  

This falls far below the current share price, indicating the business is likely overvalued at this time.

1669129213,i'm buying meta stock üöÄ,"Meta Platforms stock has suffered significantly this past year, with slowing revenue growth signaling Wall Street to downgrade the stock.  The business is certainly going through a period of slower growth than the past, but it is not a dead business.  

Growth should return by 2024 as the company matures the monetization of some of its products and services.  For example, Instagram Reels will begin monetization next year, and Reality Labs revenue continues to grow.  Don't count Meta out just yet, especially at the stock's current valuation.

1669732209,apple stock: bet against it? china riots!,"The current political climate in China has some investors nervous.  Foxconn, one of the world's largest manufacturers, which is located in China, has been have trouble with protests from its workers.  The business is responsible for producing massive amounts of iPhones, but many workers, who are living in terrible living conditions, have started rioting because of conflicts with the government's policy regarding Covid-19.  Even a foreign journalist was beaten by police in the street.  

What does this mean for Apple investors?  The company is still exceptional, but management will sooner or later have to address this situation, especially considering the fact that 98% of iPhones are produced by Chinese contractors.  Talks of diversity, equity, and inclusion can only go so far without commensurate action.  

The current valuation of the stock at around 24 times forward earnings is not incredibly expensive, but given the risks of the business right now there does not seem like a good risk to reward ratio in order to buy shares (though shorting the stock may not be a good decision either).

The business is now trading at just eight times forward earnings, with tens of billions of dollars in cash on its balance sheet and no net debt.  Although there are concerns about the significant drop in the company's operating margins, this business is still highly profitable and should return to growth in a few years.  

It has the financial capacity to weather out the storm, and even buy back shares at these prices if management so desires.  With just modest growth going forward, we should expect high returns from this stock, primarily because the valuation multiple has been punished so heavily.
