there's a likely anti-trust suit brewing for apple. top politicians are calling out apple for colluding with iran and red china keep free speech down in all platforms. when elon musk opened twitter to free speech, apple attempted to play dirty and remove it from the app store. microsoft was far smaller than apple is now, microsoft did no real monopolistic things when they lost their antitrust suit in the 90s. apple stock is quite likely about to really tank... apple's not just bigger and more guilty of anti-trust, they're literally colluding with our foreign enemies to destroy the usa from the inside and people might stop buying their products all together. https://twitter.com/i/status/1597619967062863874 you're living history guys, ever see a nation get subverted from the inside? every corporate slogan is there to cover a weakness. banks/lawyers call themselves trusts. for every slogan you hear, reverse it and that's the truth. think different? nah, it's conform or be cast out - rush, but they're conforming with ccp and iran who's own people don't even like to live under. apple's stock is about to nosedive, but when? lets discuss.",-10,,goodnewsjimdotcom,0

1669904109,"&gt; wages are still stagnant on average. 

courtesy of /u/kanyewestsconscience....

&gt; uk: [average weekly earnings](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/november2022), total pay was ¬£538 in june 2019 and ¬£612 in june 2022. so, 13.8% nominal wage growth over the past 3 years. realised inflation over the same period was 13.5% - index went from 107.93 to 121.79. so, all together we have roughly 0.3% positive real wage growth.
&gt; 
&gt; now lets look at the eurozone as a whole. [compensation per employee](https://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?series_key=320.mna.q.y.i8.w2.s1.s1._z.com_ps._z._t._z.ix.v.n) (their analogue of awe) has gone from 107.3 in q2 2019 to 115.11 in q2 2022 (this is a normalised index rather than euro values, but it measures the same thing). so wage growth in the euro bloc was 7.2% over the past 3 years. now, euro area inflation, as measured by hicp, went from 104.8 in june 2019 to 116.3 in june 2022, or 11.0% cumulative. combining these, we find that real wage growth in the euro area has been -3.8% over the past 3 years.",3,,aintbroke_dontfixit,0

1669906117,"this kind of bullshit gets asked all the damn time. it is such a lame and uninteresting argument. if tom from tastytrade made all of this money from developing thinkorswim, why did he make his own trading platform called tastyworks?  why does he do paid speaking appearances?  why do famous lawyers teach at prestigious universities when they have successful practices and multi-millionaire clients?

it's simple. 1) to make more money. 2) because they want to.  it's not fucking rocket science.  nobody pulls money out of the market at will.  they have a random distribution of wins and losses, that if you have a statistically relevant edge, leans to the positive side of the curve.  the problem with almost every trader that sucks, and let's be honest here, the vast majority of us suck, is that we are not consistent.  we try a strategy for a week and then suddenly we have a day where we see say a 5% account drawdown and we freak out.  we tweak it trying to find what works better, and abandon all of the other trades that did work under the system.

until you can show me a distribution of 100 real trades, not backtested, cherry picked trades, with real fills, you cannot comment on anyone else strategy saying it sucks.  you just don't have the sample size to justify anything meaningful besides your own opinion.  i should say i do not trade oliver's style, but per the op, it is a very simplistic strategy that is easy to learn and in trending markets, makes more money than it loses.  therefore, it should be a profitable one over the long term, especially if you can pick stocks that are moving each day and avoiding the range bound mess most stocks are in day-in and day-out.

rounding it all out, if i was a successful trader that had a proven ""edge"", i would also give it out.  i would probably even sell it to make more money.  why not?  the market is not suddenly going to become sentient and make all trades from that point on go against me.  i can guarantee you the guys at blackrock and goldman sachs don't care that chris from canada makes $10,000/day trading options on $nvda when they are making $1m a day per ticker on nvda, spy, tsla, and another 25 others.",3,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0

at the end of the day, gambling is about ideas. you're making a prediction and tying a real world stake to it to make it interesting for all parties. if i have an idea that the jets should win a particular game, or that microsoft stock should go up, why shouldn't i be able to capitalize on it?

the reason $aapl is going up is the fed. tech assets have duration risk with inflation (future cash flows get discounted if rates move up). if we are starting to see rates drop in the future (powell signaled this) then tech will likely get some tailwind behind it. you are also running up against seasonality here.

trading thesis : tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials  helps to narrow down moving tickers  
fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.   
i look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less that 500 million.   
the shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used ( or shares traded). that information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.   
things to consider when finding the plays-   
\* if the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, i will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.   
\* if the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, i would consider it for a long play. if trading less than the movement of the ticker, i would consider a short or put play.  ( if all the other factors previously mentioned checks out. )   
\* the trades are researched afternoon daily  to find possible tickers making a big move.",4,,Badboyardie,0

1670009832,"""stocks"" yes, for sure.  a focus on ""dividend stocks"", no, not at your age.

i'm guessing you don't understand dividends.  imagine you put 100 dollar bills in a drawer, other people have money in the drawer too.  that's you buying stock in a company.  a dividend is the company giving you $1 back _of your own money_ as taxable income.  

as a younger investor, you don't want that money back.  you want to keep in stocks to keep growing with the company so your ""drawer assets"" grow and grow.  (a retired person likes dividends if they don't have other income and the dividends stay below the minimum tax level.)

some stocks have dividends, some don't. you make money in the stock market from ""total return"": the amount a stock goes up in value plus any dividends the company may or may not pay out.  the increase in the value of a stock is far more important than dividends.  apple stock has gone up about 250% the past five years; its dividend is only responsible for about 3% of that return.

basically, ignore dividends.  buy stocks in good companies that will go up in value... or in etfs (exchange traded funds) that are groups of stocks.

a good place to start is getting shares in the voo etf.  it mirrors the s&amp;p500, the 500 biggest us companies.  after you get more familiar with stocks, you can then branch out to individual stocks or other etfs like qqq (the nasdaq100) or xle (energy companies) or tan (solar companies), etc.

1670034476,"the first thing you need to know about trading is how hard it is. it‚Äôs extremely competitive. you‚Äôre swimming in the same waters as citadel, sig, goldman, jp morgan, and many other big institutions who hire people smarter than you and i could ever be.

nobody‚Äôs out there handing out free money.

citadel doesn‚Äôt make money by regulating its emotions. jp morgan doesn‚Äôt hire psychologists to run their trading desk. market makers allow you to buy or sell stock whenever you want by posting bids and asks (in exchange for the spread). some prop desks are dedicated to arbitrage trades, making sure etfs such as spy, qqq, etc are trading at fair value compared to the component stocks.

these firms make money because they do useful things, and so should you.

while you‚Äôre not going to be able to make markets or run high frequency strategies, you can do other useful things. here‚Äôs a few examples from boring to interesting

boring: equity risk premium

‚Ä¢	‚Å†companies raise capital by selling stock. they motivate buyers by selling stock for less than the future earnings of the company. you provide companies capital by buying stock, and earn a return when those earnings materialize.

less boring: stat arb

‚Ä¢	‚Å†you know that certain companies are very similar, so they should move together. maybe visa and mastercard are so similar you expect them to have a linear relationship. sometimes, there‚Äôs too much demand for visa stock, so visa outpaces mastercard temporarily. you can sell visa and buy mastercard. this supplies visa stock to people willing to overpay for it, and you‚Äôll be compensated when that demand subsides and the relative value between the two stocks come back together.

somewhat interesting: crypto basis arb

‚Ä¢	‚Å†crypto perpetual futures are pretty cool to trade. they have funding rates which push futures prices towards the spot price of the crypto coins. for example, if bitcoin futures are more expensive than bitcoin itself, people who hold bitcoin futures have to pay interest to short sellers of those futures. this incentivizes people to supply these highly demanded futures. you can sell perp futures, buy bitcoin to hedge, and collect interest in exchange for providing futures speculators with highly demanded contracts.

trading is hard. but trading is also fun. it‚Äôs a lifetime of learning. but most importantly, it‚Äôs a market. you have to offer something to get paid.

good luck!",1,,ArchegosRiskManager,0
1670035208,"the bogleheads method in this context would be to just sell all your apple stock and buy low cost etfs like 33% voo 33% vxus and 34% vti

it would literally take you 20-30 minutes total to accomplish setting up and account and buying this portfolio. and 20 years from now you would habe about 6 times as much money as your current apple stocks are worth. never have to study anything or learn about the market. 

bonus points - turn on drip. (its a check box on a fidelity account that automatically reinvests all dividends into the stocks you own.)

1670045905,"&gt; i thought the whole purpose of nfts is that you be certain of their provenance by ""chain of custody""?

yes, but the chain has to begin somewhere, which is at minting. blockchain has no knowledge of provenance before that. the problem with art nfts is that i can mint an nft to an artwork that i don't legally own. and [opensea was rife with that](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/technology/nft-opensea-theft-fraud.html)

i realise your point was broader than art, but i brought it back to art because firstly art (using that word extremely generously) is the most well known and widespread uses of nft and secondly because it illustrates the problems very well. 


&gt; concert tickets was a good example brought up in other comments. 

i think concert tickets are a terrible example for an nft use case. here's why: the concept of a ticket implies a central authority (the event producer/organiser) who has commercial rights to the proceeds from the event. so for any solution to work, they need to allow it, so we need to see if it makes any sense for them. as a secondary goal, it should also make sense for the visitors to the event. 

nfts are primarily used as collectibles or as tradeables. now event organisers usually hate people reselling their tickets because that allows unscrupulous third parties to buy tickets in bulk and then sell them at higher rates, pocketing the difference. so a solution designed to promote such activity is bad. even as a visitor i'd be against it because it would jack up the price i need to pay - i'd rather pay that higher sum to the people that at least did the organising than some rent-seeker who adds no value. tradeability is a major negative in this context to both organiser and visitor. 

that brings us to collectibles. at best the organiser may be indifferent to this. if you were organising a coldplay concert, would you rather make an nft ticker that people could collect (and also sell), or would you rather sell keychains and mugs etc with chris martin's face, which are also collectibles but give you more opportunities to earn money? 

so in sum, we have a major disadvantage (tradeability) and a meh advantage (collectible) which has better alternatives that make more money. 


&gt; if i go to the registry agent for microsoft stock shares specifically to buy a direct registered stock, when they provide me with a stock certificate for 1 share as an nft, i'm going to trust that they had the authority to conduct that transaction

just go to wikipedia and learn the history of this case:

you'll see the original article tries to implicate biden in profiting off one of his son's already sketchy business deals. thd sketchy business deals that probably should be illegal is a real thing. whether joe biden actually profited off of them is much harder to prove due to chain of custody in the laptop. 

so who knows but don't believe the people who think this started as leaked pictures of hunter. it started as what probably should be a serious discussion of political corruption but was quickly turned into palace gossip. it's almost like the media doesn't want to point fingers but every politician is doing what hunter did. at least a lot of them are. trump did. clarence thomas. mitch mcconnell. pelosi and insider trading on visa stock.

1670160510,"unfortunately for you, op likely lived through one of the greatest economic expansions in us history. given the reference to the poster, he was likely born in the late 70‚Äôs early 80‚Äôs. early 90‚Äôs, if invested correctly, most people made a freaking mint. into the 2000‚Äôs, investing in tech also resulted in extreme growth until the tech bubble burst. even then, most came out in good shape. this was the beginning of the end, 2008 happened, but again most people did ok because of time in market. if you were invested since the 90‚Äôs you would still be way up on any investments. after that, markets have gone nuts until the recent recession that will likely end our economy or send us into a deep recession for a decade. but again, time in market beats all, investments from the 90s are likely up 100% - 1000%. my father has microsoft stock from the 90s that is up 800% still.

if you couple this with the growth companies experienced and being apart of one of those companies, you could move up quickly, still have a work life balance, and receive benefits like health insurance fully paid for no deductible or out of pocket. this level of economic prosperity is now much harder to achieve unless you explicitly live off of 1/3 of your income and save/invest the rest. i know this because my company stock has grown 400% since i joined and i don‚Äôt have near the same level of wealth my father had at the same point, doing most of the same things. fact is, the 1% are making it much harder for anyone else to join their club and they want to keep it that way.",3,,CryptoMortgage,0

1670270737,"&gt; of course it does, would never argue that.

so why is it treated as an expense rather than an investment?  if i buy $500 shares of microsoft stock, i'm assumed to have accrued something of value.  but if i spend $500 to learn the intricacies of visual studio, we pretend its just money that's vanished down a hole.

&gt; someone has to pay for it

the entire theory of deficit spending is that growth in production will pay for debts accrued historically.  i'll happily spot you that the feds and states have engaged in some enormous malinvestments.  but real education spending (minus shit like sports stadiums and oversized administrative overhead) ain't a part of it.  the american income earners of today generate vastly more than it cost to educate them a generation ago.

&gt; aren't we talking about budged deficit here?

we're talking about entitlement shortfalls, specifically.  and you can't cover generational gaps in retirement costs by selling off all your seed corn.  the reason social security / medicare are things we can afford to provide today are - again - because of the savvy investments in education and the attendant economic growth they produced in the prior generation.",1,,Brilliant-Mud4877,0

if the econ is still in the shitter, meaning low liquidity across the markets, next btc halving will have a very small impact relative to what i think people expect. then again, these prices are manipulated by whales especially in low volume so maybe we go into an irrational pump anyway.

i think next wave of investors is going to be institutions. that gets said every cycle but regulations seem so inevitable now. it'd be pretty nice to buy aapl stock and self custody it, or use it inside defi, nice to dump my bags on 'them' instead of the other way around for once too.

1670352925,"leverage is used to maximize return and these concepts are learned by people who study finance.  ‚Äòtricks‚Äô is not really the right word here it‚Äôs much more like a marathon of unending gate keeping.

basically professions like finance, accounting and lawyers more or less functionally exist to obfuscate the exact methods wealthy people make and stay wealthy.  very few people could ever personally acquire all of these credentials and the real world nuts and bolts methods for applying them.  those few that do would not have the relationships needed to execute with them.  therefore you have to ‚Äòknow a guy‚Äô in each area to take the actions needed to copy the wealthy.

the easiest way, unfortunately, to become wealthy is to learn to network early and often with rich people and be useful to them by doing one of these professions for them. 

 you will never ‚Äòcatch up‚Äô to rich people investing in the stock market because your share of apple stock will never make more than warren buffet‚Äôs share of apple stock and they will always have more insider information than you. the stock market is an environment created by the rich and heavily subsidized by the government in order to soak up all available income/capital owned by the non-rich.

the only way to ‚Äòcatch up‚Äô to the rich is to acquire a non-commoditized asset that you can manage and grow wisely using your specialized knowledge and time.  knowledge/skills and time are the huge advantage we have because warren buffet would never have time to water a tomato plant but you do.  but this only works if you put time into an asset you have a competitive advantage on (ie real estate or a business *not* stock) instead of selling all of your time for a fixed wage with 0 chance of upside.

so all that said the best way to grow wealth is something like real estate because normal people have access to very low interest rates (allowing leverage) and you can learn the skills to wisely manage and repair the property and you have a competitive advantage of knowing your local market well and what areas are up and coming.

starting a business is another one but *be careful* many businesses are actually liabilities.  you always hear about how 90% of restaurants fail but not why they fail. it‚Äôs because of a crushing *rent* payment or a large loan not because of low ebitda.  so don‚Äôt just go from being a wage peon to being a commercial storefront rent peon. again the big winner here is often the commercial real estate owner and you are the tenant making them rich.

so learn to network, acquire skills that can be used to wisely manage / improve the asset you want to acquire.  minimize personal expenses to build capital and then invest in your first asset when possible.",4,,MrMathamagician,0

with a tv or any other asset that depreciates in value in almost all instances, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. i bought it from you knowing it was going to be worth less tomorrow than today.

within the art market and anything else that involves an asset that can depreciate or appreciate and back again‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs betting. it‚Äôs investing. some investments pay off. you paid $5 for apple stock or ¬¢5 for gamestop stock before they went boom. great. you won. or it flops and you‚Äôre out money. and the original owner of anything with fluctuating value ‚Äî you may be selling it because that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs worth. or selling it because you need someone else to finance it. you‚Äôre receiving a benefit. and that‚Äôs the other side of this same coin and where i think your argument doesn‚Äôt hold so much water‚Ä¶ for every taylor swift, how many no name flops are there? no hit wonders? bad investments? and to that same point, how many taylor swifts are there that wouldn‚Äôt be big without that initial investment. 

she received both financial and utility value from that investment. all the raw talent in the world doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is a system you don‚Äôt just break into because of raw talent. at the very very least, it‚Äôs the microscopic exception to the near universal rule. lots of hyper-talented but unemployed artists in nashville, austin, ny and la.

so the situation here is that she made a deal ‚Äî i‚Äôll sell you the rights to this for access and money. he said i‚Äôll give you access and money for the rights to these songs. fair trade. could have amounted to nothing. could have made him but not her rich. ended up making them both rich. and great. but the idea that she‚Äôs entitled to an asset that appreciated greatly in value and continues to appreciate ‚Äî is laughable. if bill gates sold microsoft when it was middling and it became huge, he shouldn‚Äôt get to buy it back just because he wants to.

it seems to me that if he‚Äôs a dick, that she‚Äôs greedy and hired a better pr team to make this out to be an emotional matter rather than completely a money matter. and she had an even cleverer solution to a brick wall. cudos to her. but the idea that this was about anything other than money is silly.",2,,Rational-Discourse,0

1670420775,"well there are things we do agree on.

if we scrap oas, ei, income support, fire all the people working in those departments, and set up an easy to apply for basic income there would be a massive net savings. to get this you should have to disclose corporate holdings, and if you are a majority shareholder (not just holding 50k in apple stock), you should have to reveal your corporate profits if you are applying for more money. however the large savings as you pointed out comes from the reduced budget from firing thousands of government employees.   
there will always be cheaters to the system, but the current government has not tried to fix those problems, instead they have tripled down on more taxes for the middle class, and giving away billions of dollars.

the carbon tax makes 0 sense. if it actually worked people would just leave canada for a lower tax jurisdiction where they can pollute more. you and i have to pay more at the pump, but any large corporation is just going to raise the costs to keep the same profit level and the cost is again dumped on you and me. this drives inflation, and takes money only out of the middle class once again.

to bring this back to my top comment. this government has wasted a shit ton of money on nothing, has driven up the cost of living for all the middle / lower class. dumped so much money at the bottom that the money supply / inflatation has hurt the people they ""wanted to help"" more than not giving them money would have. instead of realized some of what they fucked up, they double down, hand out more money, and increase taxes on all the bottom / middle through further inflationary taxing.

please call me a selfish con, as apparently that is what it means to not want canada to be a poor country where no one can afford to live.",2,,Slightly_Damaged_Car,0

1670433788,"~~i don't exactly know which psu calculator you used,~~ but here's what i do know.

*missed the be quiet part. be quiet calculator recommends overspecced psus for marketing purposes, so no surprises.*

let's use the fe card as a reference:

max power draw for the 4090: 450w (although in ltt testing it was more like 400w, but let's still count 450).

let's say you have a 13900k: 253w max (stock power limit).

253w+450w= 703w, so we have 150w left (on an 850w psu) for the drives/fans and so on, which is plenty as none of these are particularly power hungry.

this perfectly aligns with 850w recommendation for the fe cards as well as for many aib cards like gigabyte windforce, asus tuf oc edition, msi ventus 3x, etc.

let's say we have an rog strix card with significant oc, which consumes about 500w max - getting 1000w psu gives a significant overhead still, which also perfectly aligns with the 1000w recommendation by asus.

edit: here's a paragraph from techpowerup 4090 review:

&gt; it's important to note that 450 w is a very arbitrary number for the rtx 4090's power limit, the gpu rarely draws that much power in typical gaming workloads. our own testing at stock settings sees its gaming power draw around the 340 w-mark. quasar zone tested the rtx 4090 with a power limit as low as 60% (270 w). with its most aggressive power management they could muster (i.e. 270 w pl), the card was found to lose just around 8% of performance at 4k uhd, averaged across five aaa games at maxed out settings. the story is similar with undervolting the gpu down to 850 mv, down from its 1 v stock. in both cases, the performance loss appear well contained, while providing a reduction in power-draw (in turn heat and noise).

ltt and others also did a lot of power-related testing, including underspecced psus and undervolting and power limits. they made it run stabely on a 650w midrange psu with marginal performance loss and while that's not a good scenario for a real world build, ot still gives you a good perspective on the power draw.",3,,LEO7039,0

1670442893,"here is my take on it. 

you should contribute to a roth ira even if it may not be the most advantageous because the best thing in retirement is diversity. just like you don't put all your investments into apple stock you shouldn't put everything into a pretax 401k. likewise you shouldn't put everything into a roth or into a taxable account. 




putting some money into a roth as well as a pre tax has a few advantages beyond the current tax rate.


1) you do not know the future for much of the past 100years federal income tax was higher than it is now. it could easily go up.

2) having ""roth"" money gives you some ""free"" money to play with. say in retirement you want to buy a boat or a car withdrawal of an additional taxable 100k could throw you into a whole new tax bracket and it could affect your medicare premiums and things like that.

3) roth ira's are accessable much earlier than your 401k. i believe 5 years after you put money into it you can take the contribution back out without a penalty. 




it's foolishness to do 100% roth but you can use the combo of pretax and roth withdrawals in retirement to avoid paying hardley any taxes.",164,,CnCz357,0

maybe a few dozen if you have a popular local scene and friends. to expand beyond that'd you probably have to go out and spend additional money to travel to magic events.

on arena those cards can let you access and play against literally thousands of people. yes, you can't resell them but the actual play value of them is much higher. i can be anywhere in the world and if i have my phone and an internet connection, i can play magic. you can't do that with paper.

and if profitability is what you're after, then there are much better options. if you bought $90 worth of apple stock in 1995, it'd be worth approximately $45,000 today. 

you can simply choose to not play alchemy and not buy alchemy packs if you don't want to interface with that part of arena.

paper has its place, it's a fundamental part of magic, but i don't understand why people constantly harp on saying arena cards are worthless because you can't resell them. they provide entertainment value in other ways that paper can't.",3,,DeadlyFatalis,0

a example is apple. they will make the iphone 15 hoping the masses will buy. big failure apple stock tanks. they use there own money to develop and design. 

dod puts out a rfp request for proposal. where they pay you to make the prototype. be a pool of money that the companies selected can access. even in the proposed design you lose no money. then if awarded they will buy all the tools, pay the electrical bill for the involvement in creation of that product.

1670497757,"&gt; crypto people are more stupid then i could possibly imagine

they absolutely are. they're blinded by greed and it makes them very stupid.

crypto people will constantly say ""not your keys, not your crypto"" and still fall for schemes like this all the time. 

[binance was just audited](https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/binance_por_report_7_december_2022.pdf) and the auditors found them to be slightly over leveraged. it's just 101%, but when you dig deeper in the report this turns out to be extremely generous, because they count the digital assets based on their market price.

binance was a big ftt holder and them [offloading their tokens](https://www.investopedia.com/binance-to-sell-ftt-6826211) caused the value to crash. so binance themselves only have enough assets to remain solvent so long as they never actually need to cash out a meaningful amount of any of their digital assets. the very act of doing that would cause the value to crash, meaning they'd instantly become way more than 101% over leveraged. 

at the end of the day crypto tokens and coins aren't like apple or microsoft stock which actually translate into a share of something valuable. they're smoke that will dissipate at the slightest bit of pressure.

so giving more money to sbf in a couple years probably isn't any riskier than using binance, tether, or any other service whose reserves are backed by crypto.",2,,TheInternetCanBeNice,0

a successful company might pay a $5 million salary with an additional $20 million in stock, whereas a failing company will have to pay a $30 million salary with $5 million in stock. they're effectively getting paid a similar amount (the ceo at the bad company might get paid a premium for harming their reputation by attaching it to a failing company), but some headlines will just say that the ceo at the bad company is being paid 6x more.

for your example, steve jobs was only being paid $1 a year but he owned a significant amount of apple stock so he had a vested interest in improving the company. if he doubled apple's share price he would basically be doubling his net worth, it's not like he was taking $1/year out of the kindness of his heart. that's how it works for most company founders that still hold a big stake in their company; musk, zuck, and bezos all have a salary of basically zero.",2,,FreeNoahface,0

if an apple stock was worth $500 and was giving a $100 dividend with an ex date of tomorrow; after tomorrow the stock would only be worth $400 because you no longer will receive that $100 for buying it.",1,,prodoosh,0

sure, they do pay a dividend and buyback some stock.

they're a hardware company at the end of the day and it's consumer discretionary. i didn't say they aren't a good company but they have lots of problems and the stock price is completely dislocated from the underlying business...and not in a good way. 

anyone that thinks apple is a 2t company is mistaken. they have an insane growth premium priced into the stock but that will get ripped out of it in due time.

this contrasts with something like apple stock shares, since apple has the monopoly in minting new shares and someone with a short position would indeed have to eventually become a buyer.

when the miner shorts a coin with the intention of delivering later, he has a cost of mining in mind. if btc falls below that cost, it may become cheaper for him to buy a btc instead of mining it to close out the short. so while shorts are not a guaranteed buy, it likely means one.",3,,meteoraln,0

let's say musk just goes full kanye and burns twitter down.  maybe the brand &amp; audience value is down to 4-5b and revenue is at 0.  _and_ musk tells morgan stanley that twitter can no longer service the debt, forcing them to act.

at that point they will see if anyone else wants to buy twitter.  remember, at this point the banks own twitter, they can do what they want with it.  maybe microsoft wants to buy twitter for 8b.  i've heard benioff might take a swing at it.  rakuten is perhaps the strongest suitor, at 9b it could be fully funded by the japanese market alone.
  
musk would be betting that he could buy twitter for more than anyone else, but less than 12b$ (the amount owed to banks).    
  
and _even if he won that crazy gamble_, and managed to make a ""profit"" of 4-5b$ (an amount he makes or loses daily on tesla stock fluctuations), he'd then have to start his twitter journey by fixing the damage he did in the process.  it's like trashing the house you're leasing so badly that your landlord has to sell, then buying the same house at auction - sounds clever, but you're living in a trashed house.",12,,AdLegitimate3147,0

let's make a hypothetical example. microsoft will buy activision in such a way that for every 3 activision shares you have you get 1 microsoft share and 30$. if you have a non 3 divisible amount the extra is just cash at 70$ a share. so if you have 302 shares of activision you end with 100 shares of microsoft and 3140$. 300 shares becomes 100 + 3000$ and your last 2 get converted into 140$.

the year end rally is the result of people buying spy and driving the price up

as a result, this should at least provide some tailwind for aapl, as spy contains aapl stock which will increase in price due to spy's increased price. 

hence why looking at spy's trend is helpful in determining whether to long a stock  ie aapl.

1670707716,"tranche trading(as i call it) is sacrilegious in the trading world. the general consensus is not to average down but to cut losses and look for the lower setup. tranche traders mainly counter trade and all the popular trading euphemisms vilify their strategies. one‚Äôs like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt catch a falling knife‚Äù or ‚Äútrend is your friend‚Äù and ‚Äúthe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent‚Äù come to mind. accordingly, you‚Äôll likely not find any programs or courses promoting this style of trading. m

all that being said, tranche trading can be powerful with the right discipline, tranche setups, understanding of probability, capital requirements, and time frame. the latter has the most importance as tranche trading on any tf(time frame) under 1h is ill advised due to the amount of noise and manipulation that exist on lower tfs. with tranche trading, you need a top down approach so you have to analyze the historical chart of your instrument of trade and hone it on its most volatile swings. make an average of the percentages of those movements and then design your tranche to fit that margin. then you can start trading within that margin by shrinking or expanding the tranche setup based off of the ebb and flow of volatility due to news/events or lack thereof. this means you can only tranche trade on markets that are too big to fail like high liquidity forex pairs or like amazon or apple stock. tranching crypto, for instance, is the quickest way to get wrekt. unlike traditional trading strats, you simply can‚Äôt employ this on low cap/volume markets. you need stability and relative predictability. 

as far as indicators go, less is more imo so i only use the standard deviation touches of a certain time frames rsi to guide my entries. you should take any oscillator indicators signals with a grain of salt as the probabilities that align with those standard deviations are only true when the dataset has a normal distribution which only applies to the highest time frame that exist(the entire dataset). 

i‚Äôve already said a lot and thats because shit is complicated but tranching is a viable strategy that i‚Äôve tested. the thing is it can be very time intesive and if you have to define how deep in the red you‚Äôre willing to tolerate beforehand. if you do it right, you literally don‚Äôt have a loosing trade 98% of the time and can compound your capital so you can either expand your tranches and make similar profits with less risk or maintain the same amount of risk while increasing your profits; up to you. 

when you do loose, it should be relatively small as long as you realize early on that you made a mistake in your trade plan. if you don‚Äôt realize it and let it run on hoping it will turn around despite a terrible setup, losses can be catastrophic. 

so yea, tranching is the dark side of trading that no one talks about because its the endgame strategy. if you have enough capital and big enough tranche tiers, you can just take trades willy nilly because you already know you have enough capital to average down until the pa(price action) inevitably reverses.

my personal tranche setup atm is 1x, 2x, 6x, 18x and then a tight stop loss if the pa goes beyond the consolidation of the last tranche. 
you‚Äôll notice that each tranche after the first is twice the sum of the previous so my position location always moves 3/4 of the way from my previous point to the current pa. i also do 1x, 3x, 12x sometimes. the tranche amount, and sizes is entirely dependent on the direction i‚Äôm trading relative to the trend. as you can see, there is alot of creative freedom here but its all a balance of risk, reward, and time cost.

anyway, thats my ted talk about the forbidden trading style.",1,,redditsuxdonkeyass,0

1670721976,"sorry d_trader. i misread your reply.  the risk is not capped on covered calls. your risk goes all the way to zero. for example, let‚Äôs say bought 100 shares meta stock for 185 back in august. that would have cost you $18,500 to own stock. let‚Äôs say you sold one dec 3 185 calls for $15 ($1,500).  the calls would have expired worthless last friday and you would have pocketed $1,500.  however, your stock is now down to 115 so you‚Äôre down $7,000 from the underlying. but you took in $1,500 credit so total loss is $5,500. 
the other scenario is, let‚Äôs say you sold 1 dec 3 185 put for $1,500 instead.  now that put is worth $7,000 to the buyer because it is now deep itm.  you, the seller, is on the other side of the trade so you‚Äôre down $7,000.  that means he has the right to sell it for $185 and you are obligated to buy it for $185.  185-115 is 70 or $7000. but you took in $1,500 when you sold the put.  that means your total loss is $5,500 which is the same exact loss as the covered call. if meta were to go down to zero, the loss for cc and naked put would be identical, $18,500. i know brokers make it seem like cc are safe and they don‚Äôt allow naked puts but the risk is the same",1,,Prestigious-Ad-7927,0

1670833082,"&gt; thinking bitcoin is like any other inflationary currency

yes, bitcoin can be a better store of value than an inflationary currency assuming bitcoin survives and assuming you bought it higher than you sell it. except in the most extreme cases, it is still better to invest your money than keep it as bitcoin for 8+ years at a time. at best a currency's value is equal to the amount of stuff on the market that people are actively selling for that currency. the fact is that very very little of what people buy can be purchased directly with bitcoin and that is completely the fault of the people who hold bitcoin like it were apple stock in the 1980s.

currency isn't an investment, currency is a tool for buying and selling and as a short-term (~1 month?) liquid store of value. if you have to store your value for longer then try precious metals or land. if you want to earn an increase then invest it in stocks, mutual funds, education, infrastructure or machinery.",-1,,IronSmithFE,0

also, apple is the largest stock in the s&amp;p500 and makes up roughly 6% of the index currently. so for every $100 in an s&amp;p500 index fund you buy, you are buying roughly $6 of apple stock. therefore, if you also buy apple individually, you are increasing your exposure to apple, which is already your largest position.",10,,PizzaTrader,0

1670858974,"i completely missed ten years of tech stock ""who cares about valuation?"" party, but also didn't own any of them when they finally got crushed. i briefly held fb but sold it at a small loss, deciding i didn't understand it. 

 i now own an oil and gas etf called fill, canadian dividend paying pipelines like enb and trp, an oil tanker firm eurn, and crox, a value play after the market hated their heydude acquisition. so i am up materially from november.

fill has a lot of refiners/integrateds in it, so it's not a great tracker of the commodities, but it gives me energy exposure without canadian political risk.

i am holding bags on other names:

luv, with the giant rebound in air travel demand not yet reflected in the stock due to summer logistical nightmares  at airports and now recession fears. this will work, eventually.

dltr, which should be ok in a recession and was recommended by meryl witmer, who always makes me money, but dltr has been slow to turn around its family dollar division, which was her thesis. this one, like luv, will take more time. 

i own a couple of canadian banks, which have been great historically and not great lately. 

i've missed lots of upside by having no exposure to canadian oil and gas stocks because moronic pm justin trudeau wants to destroy the industry, which provides canada's number one export by value. he'll probably impose a windfall tax, cheered on by fellow dipstick juggy singh.

i mean, in case gelsinger can pull off those 20a/18a nodes in 2024/2025, things will get very different and amd will have to compete on price. he does sound arrogant but he is a strong ceo.

nvidia will continue its lead. maybe amd can grab some small slice in both gaming and gpu datacenter but nvidia stays dominant. but well $nvda is valued too high. and in downturns, i prefer amd's x86 moat over nvidia's cuda moat. their attack on datacenter cpu via grace is also weaker than amd's mi300 on datacenter gpu.

1670873027,"my **raku** solution.  not quite happy with it, too much almost identical code in `calc_distance` and `calc_rdistance`.

part 1 was pretty straightforward: build a map of points reachable with distance 0, 1, etc.

    # calculate distance from the start point to any (reachable) point on the grid
    method calc-distance()
    {
        # the start point has distance 0, obviously
        my ($start-x, $start-y) = self.pos-of('s');
        @!distance[$start-y;$start-x] = 0;
        my @at-distance;
        @at-distance[0].push: ($start-x,$start-y);

        # look for points with distance 1, 2, ...
        for 1..‚àû -&gt; $d {
            # consider all points with distance d-1
            for @at-distance[$d-1][] -&gt; ($x,$y) {
                # check all reachable neighbours, and if they don't have a distance
                # yet, assign distance d
                for self.reachable-neighbours($x,$y) -&gt; ($u, $v) {
                    without @!distance[$v;$u] {
                        @!distance[$v;$u] = $d;
                        @at-distance[$d].push: ($u,$v);
                    }
                }
            }

            # no points with distance d?  we're done.
            last unless @at-distance[$d];
        }
    }

for part 2, i first tried rebuilding the distance map for each potential starting point, which worked, but was quite slow; so i changed it to build a ‚Äúreverse distance‚Äù map with the distance of each point to the end.

value investing is about getting good value, e.g buying undervalued players. a 120m player can be undervalued, just like how virgil and alisson was world-record fees for their respective position, but significantly better than similar priced players that were bought after them (maguire and kepa). in hindsight, the price for both have looked like a steal, and we could probably have sold ali and virgil for 50-100% more than their fee just a year later.

buying a player we value to ¬£15m for ¬£22m is expensive as fuck in terms of a value investor's perspective. buying a ¬£140m *(number made up to prove a point, we don't know what the club values him at)* player for ‚Ç¨120m (¬£103m) is a great price. it would be equivalent to buying apple stock for $105 right now.",2,,ExceedingChunk,0

insane that comments like these without an iota of proof get upvoted so much. 

do you have any proof that they are riddled with bots?

do you have any proof that they are unable to face competitors like tiktok? by what metric? they literally posted ath dau and mau last quarter.

1670957593,"first he talks about how, in 2013-14. there were 3.2mil shares short (10% of the float(pretty average)). then 2 weeks later there are only 1.2mil shares short. nasdaq says 2mil shares were moved off-shore. nasdaq doesn't want to say who it was.
then talks about naked shorting and shorting and distorting. 
fast forward to covid. oli went negative, so to provide value to investers they were looking for a merger ($meta). later on the stock moves up, so they started converting their 18mil of debt. with an approved atm they raised 140$ million (for $meta). but their oil and gas assets ($mmtlp) weren't meant to be traded. short, of course, had to cover their short positions in $trch.

october 2021, $mmtlp started trading. he calls otc:mkts. he asks them to take it down immediately, which they couldn't because finra approved it. since brda himself couldn't call finra, because he wasn't a ceo technically, meta called finra. finra said it was in two marketmakers their right to trade $mmtlp.
they researched a bit and found out the marketmakers didn't actually cover.

he receives a note from the occ (options regulator) from july first 2021. of you owe shares, they would delay settlement of $mmtlp, until they figured out if it was tradeable. 

october 2022, stock started moving up, when the s-1 got approved. so past friday, it was meant that the stock was only able to sell, so shorts could cover. because the short needed to cover and shorts have infinite risk. you could set the price to whatever you wanted. 

he thinks that the reported, 6.5mil shares short, weren't true, because if so why would they halt if there is such a small amount of shares short. 

for the rest of the vid they kinda talk about the bullshit in general.",20,,HutsMaster,0

gates studied the work of andrew carnegie and john d. rockefeller, and donated some of his microsoft stock in 1994 to create the ""william h. gates foundation"". in 2000, gates and his wife combined three family foundations and gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable bill &amp; melinda gates foundation, which was identified by the funds for ngos company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[141][142] the foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the wellcome trust.[143][144] gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to carnegie mellon university for a new building to be named gates center for computer science which opened in 2009.[145][146]

gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of david rockefeller as a major influence. gates and his father met with rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[147] as of 2007, bill and melinda gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in america, having given over $28 billion to charity;[148] the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to charity.[149]

the foundation is organized into five program areas: global development division, global health division, united states division, and global policy &amp; advocacy division. among others, it supports a wide range of public health projects, granting aid to fight transmissible diseases such aids, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate polio. it grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and supports scholarships at universities. the foundation established a water, sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services in poor countries.[150] its agriculture division supports the international rice research institute in developing golden rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin a deficiency.[151] the goal of the foundation is to provide 120 million women and girls, in the poorest countries, with high-quality contraceptive information and services, with the longer-term goal of universal access to voluntary family planning.[152] in 2007, the los angeles times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries.[153] although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility,[154] it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[155]",1,,JohnLaw1717,0

tricks (that i hadn't used on other days):

* represent coordinates as complex numbers. real = left &amp; right, imaginary = up &amp; down
* use a hashtable to represent coordinates with stones (value = -1) or sand (value = number of sand grains that are stuck)
* ""draw"" the rock paths by linearly interpolating between adjacent points.
* use a stack to represent coordinates of sand that we want to keep following
    * the top of the stack represents the farthest fall so far
    * when a grain of sand has no more possible lower paths, it's stuck, so mark that spot in the hashtable and pop it off the stack

* it's kind of slow?
* ... but it was satisfying and straightforward to write, once the stack+complex idea popped into my head.",3,,bis,0

b&amp;b rules are to stop people buying and selling the same stock within 30 days.

this is because every financial year you owned apple stock, you could have sold it on the 5th april and bought again on the 6th. if the stock is up, you could have locked in the capital gains exemption of ¬£12,300 every financial year, if you did this again and again.

a trader must now wait 30 days before buying shares back, which is fine for capital gains tax planning purposes. but it means more potential for the market to move. 

in your scenario, you would still pay cgt on the stock when sold with a 2000% return and you would have a single exemption of ¬£12.3k that financial year. you could have theoretically sold and bought the stock every year to try and maximise the capital exemption, but after 30 days since the rule was introduced in 1998.",1,,audioalt8,0

on june 17 he exercised options he had purchased a year earlier to purchase 20,000 shares of stock in this semiconductor manufacturing company nvidia at a price of $100 per share, according to a disclosure filed by the speaker. nvidia shares traded at between $160 and $169 the following day when markets opened. just two days later, the senate voted to proceed to consider a bill that would provide about $52 billion in subsidies to the u.s. semiconductor industry. nvidia stock jumped to around $181 a share after that vote.

you shouldnt be charged any fees as far as i‚Äôve been told and a search says ws doesnt charge to transfer out.

2. nbdb doesn‚Äôt seem to offer fractional shares so if you want to buy say $msft, you need to be ready to buy a full share.
3. i reached out regarding a question regarding buying us equities but the representative never got back to me. 3 people told me they dont charge any fees.
long story short, you can open a us and cad tfsa. when purchasing a us equity in my cad tfsa, they were going to charge 1.86% fee. but when i purchase the us equity in my us tfsa, they only charged the difference in currencies (the spread). not to sure what that is all about but.

the main reason for me wanting to switch is because i wanted to avoid the 1.5% currency exchange fees on ws, but if nbdb is gunna charge 1.86%, idk. still yet to hear back from the person i was in contact with.

customer support from nbdb‚Ä¶ needs improvement. i‚Äôve talked to 3 reps and all 3 reps told me different stuff or reassured me of the fact ‚Äúwe dont charge fees when purchaseing us equities, only the spread‚Ä¶ so as long as you like the spread at the time of purchase then buy‚Äù


edit: this motivated me to call and actually found out some important stuff.
you cant transfer fractional shares, you will need to sell them before swapping.
only buy us equities in a us tfsa
nbdb actually does charge on their spread as they use their spread. the numbers i was getting previously is because the spread updates every 5 minutes. i tried to ask if they have a set charge on the spread (similar to how ws 1.5%) and he said since it changes every 5 min, he cant give an exact answer. so you may fill paying 0% in difference or you may fill paying 2% more on the spread, they dont provide this information but i would have to assume it‚Äôs similar to ws. at the time of writing this they are charging 1.94% to convert funds

here is the primary part of it, but you can read the rest, obviously its complicated but they make it clear its a taxable event. 

***tax classification of the*** ***spin-off*** ***in general***

for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will not be eligible for treatment as a tax-deferred distribution by meta with respect to its stock. accordingly, the spin-off will generally be treated as a fully taxable transaction. the discussion below describes the u.s. federal income tax consequences to a u.s. holder and a non-u.s. holder upon the receipt of our common stock in the spin-off.

although meta will ascribe a value to the common stock distributed in the spin-off, this valuation is not binding on the irs or any other taxing authority. these taxing authorities could ascribe a higher valuation to the distributed common stock, particularly if, following the spin-off, those shares of common stock trade at prices significantly above the value ascribed to those shares by meta. such a higher valuation may affect the spin-off distribution amount and thus the u.s. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off to meta‚Äôs series a preferred stockholders. fractional shares of common stock will not be distributed.

meta will be required to recognize any gain, but will not be permitted to recognize any loss, with respect to the common stock that it distributes in the spin-off equal to the fair market value of the common stock in excess of meta‚Äôs adjusted tax basis in the common stock.

***tax basis and holding period of company shares received by holders of meta stock***

a series a preferred stockholder‚Äôs tax basis in shares of our common stock received in the spin-off generally will equal the fair market value of such shares on the date of the spin-off, and the holding period for such shares will begin the day after the date of the spin-off.",1,,KlutzyFlamingo8126,0

* space-pad single-digit numbers, so that sorting will sort numerically across all dimensions, then sort the lines. any cubes adjacent in the z-dimension (so equal in the x- and y-dimensions) will be on consecutive lines.

* prepend a zero to all lines, then add 6 more to each line in turn, so the first line is numbered 6, the next one 12, and so on. the bottom line will contain 6 times the number of cubes ‚Äî that is, the total number of faces on all the cubes. yank it, undo the numbering, insert 2 blank lines at the top, and paste the number of faces into the top line. that's what the answer would be if none of the cubes were adjacent.

* duplicate the list of co√∂rdinates, and in that copy move the z-co√∂rdinate to the start, and resort. the y-dimension is now at the end, and any adjacent in that dimension (with equal z- and x-co√∂rdinates) will be on consecutive lines. record that process with `qa` then run it again on the duplicate to create a 3rd list of co-ordinates, this time with the y-co√∂rdinates moved to the front, and the x- at the end.

* now all adjacent cubes are on adjacent lines and differ by 1 in their final co√∂rdinate. each such pair of adjoining faces reduces the count of outer faces by 2 from the maximum that's on the top line. to find them, subtract each line from the following one in turn, and any which results in `0,0,1` will indicate an adjoining pair.

* to do this, after each co√∂rdinate line insert the vim keystrokes for subtracting it from the following lines. start by putting a copy of the entire line after it, prepended by a `j`. on those `j` copies, remove any `0` co√∂rdinates, insert a `‚ü®ctrl+x‚ü©` character after all the other numbers, and an `f` before each comma. remove all the padding spaces that were added earlier; they've served their purpose and would now get in the way. the start of the sample input now looks like this:

        78

        1,2,2
        j1^xf,2^xf,2^x
        1,2,5
        j1^xf,2^xf,5^x
        2,1,2
        j2^xf,1^xf,2^x
        2,1,5
        j2^xf,1^xf,5^x
        2,2,1
        j2^xf,2^xf,1^x
        2,2,2
        j2^xf,2^xf,2^x
        2,2,3

* in each of the 3 batches of co√∂rdinate arrangements, delete the first one, since there's nothing to subtract from it. the use `d` to delete the contents of the first `j` line into the small-delete register, `-`. type `@-` to run the keystrokes in that register: the `j` moves down to the following line, then the first number and `‚ü®ctrl+x‚ü©` subtracts the co√∂rdinates in the first dimension, `f,` moves to the comma for the second dimension, another subtraction, another `f,`, and the third subtraction, and `‚ü®enter‚ü©` to get down on to the next `j` line. record all that with `qb`, having emptied it out first, and loop at the end with `@b`.

* run `@b` to set it off on the first batch of co√∂rdinates; it will subtract each pair of lines in turn, failing ‚Äî and so exiting the loop ‚Äî when the final `j` line in that batch moves on to the blank line following it and tries to subtract something from a non-existent number. repeat for the other 2 batches: delete the first co√∂rdinate and run `@b` down the rest.

* we're only interested in subtractions that resulted in exactly `0,0,1`, so delete all the lines (except for the face-count in line¬†1) that don't match that. use the numbering trick from the beginning again, except this time each line handily already starts with a zero, so just re-use those, and add 2 on each time rather than 6.

* yank the number from the start of the bottom lines; this gets saved in register `0`. it's 2 times the number of subtractions that yielded `0,0,1` ‚Äî that is 2 times the number of adjoining pairs of cubes, or the number of internal faces. delete from the bottom up to line¬†2, leaving just the total number of faces. subtract from that the number of internal faces that is in register `0`, and that's the part¬†1 answer.

hope it was worth the wait. do let me know if you try it out: this one is reasonably easy to type ‚Äî it's fairly resilient against typos and having to press `‚ü®bkspc‚ü©` or `u`, with several ex-style commands that are easy to edit and relatively few commands inside `q` recordings. cheers!",5,,Smylers,0

if tesla were down 60% ytd and other stocks were down 5% ytd, i'd understand why someone would say the downturn is attributable to elon; but as of today (12/19/2022):  
$aapl - down 27% ytd

all he said to me was ""oh i don't really know much about those numbers or reports. but me and [the other friend] both have subscriptions to motley fool and i have one to cnbc for their stock picks. i can send them to you if you want... we usually chat about what we think are good companies based on the data from the emails, then invest.""

bill gates, for example, would have been a trillionaire if he hadn't listened to buffet and diversified out of his microsoft stock. does the fact that he has less net wealth than musk on paper due to him making a worse economic decision make anyone else's life better or worse? 

much of the world is in abject poverty due to corrupt leadership at the governmental level. this includes places like north korea, but also places like california, where the government had the largest pool of revenue from silicon valley and hollywood workers, with the highest tax rate in the nation, but still found ways to squander it all and simultaneously create programs that screwed over the poor. oh, the poor and middle class need housing? well, we're going to add 20 layers of inspectors when 2-3 could work, and add more months of build time to a house, add more costs to a house, and create an inflationary spiral for homes mixed with low interest rates to make houses extremely expensive over time, make people need to make more income (and therefore pay higher taxes) to afford the same home, pay way higher property tax, and make them unaffordable for normal americans. this wasn't borne out of ""inequality"" but rather complete ineptitude of politicians with zero background in economics and consequences. 

on top of this, companies and government incentivize people to completely stupid things. oh, you make 40k a year but you want to express yourself? well, you shouldn't need to save. buy 6 dollar coffee every day. buy a ps5. buy season laker tickets. buy netflix and hbo subscriptions. buy organic kale. go on 3 vacations a year for 2k each. go gamble away your money at vegas for fun. buy your girlfriend a 15 thousand dollar ring just because society says so. what people don't realize is that most people, even those who have the capacity to, save absolutely no money ever. i know people who drive m3s and m4s making way less money than me. of course poor people are going to remain poor if they spend every dollar they have as soon as they get it. there was a period in my life where i made less than 40k, and i saved like the devil was after me. i didn't lease a fancy bmw, i ate out very rarely, i didn't go on vacation, and i didn't rent a huge apartment. as i made more, i spent more, but i probably spent very little for the first 5 or so years of my professional career and spent time on my craft. my income went up every year, my savings went up every year, and i began to invest extremely deliberately. 

so with me starting from nothing, i grew my net wealth every year. and most of the people around me spent everything every year. so now, today, i have much higher net worth than most people my age. it's ridiculous to just frame things as inequality = bad if there is no context. 

inequality is primarily an effort and saving issue, and where it is not, it is a government competency issue.",2,,hangliger,0

*by 1987, virtually all land within the tokyo metropolis was unable to cope with demand. at this point, residential land in tokyo increased to 890,000¬•/1 sq. meter (u$6,180 based on the assumption 1u$ = 144¬•)*

this means, for 1000 sqm plot, you had to pay $6.2m. 

msft stock went up 1000x since that time.

so if you sold 1000 sqm land in tokyo in 1987 and bought msft, you would have $6.2billion now. plus dividends...

1671573239,"all the sigils in the article seem pretty redundant. first, all $ tells you is essentially 'this is a variable'. of course, i'm not an expert in raku or any language that uses sigils, really, so i may be misunderstanding something, or missing some crucial information. still, the below argument is based on the information in the article.

@ and % convey essentially no useful information which isn't already present in context: if i see `@my_arr[5]`, i already know from the `[5]` part that `my_arr` is an array that takes numeric indices. similarly, % in `%my_map[""hello""]` is similarly redundant. the same information is present in looping, for example: if i see `for $v in @my_arr`, i already know that `my_arr` is something that can be looped over; i don't need @ to tell me. finally, i question that the distinction between @ and % is particularly meaningful; even if it is, it seems that one could move this distinction where it actually matters: iteration. for example, one could require that iteration is always ordered, so you could iterate through arrays normally (`for v in arr`), but you'd need to call a function for maps (`for k, v in map.items()`), where the contract for `items()` specifies that the ordering is arbitrary.

in the same vein, with `&amp;my_func()`, the only meaningful information `&amp;` conveys is that we're calling a variable rather than a function called 'my_func'. in this sense, rather than a sigil, we can interpret '&amp;' as being essentially the dereference operator in c. i don't really mind this usage, actually, as it *is* useful information.

regarding the point made later about (if i understand correctly) automatically assigning a type to a variable based on the sigil used to declare it, it makes much more sense to me to have the type be encoded in the value rather than the variable: instead of `my @arr = 1, 2, 3`, with `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, i know from my knowledge of the language that `[1, 2, 3]` is an expression of array type. also, in initialization the value being assigned is always close to the variable be initialized, so there's no concern about how accessible the type is.",16,,firefly431,0

this has nothing to do with derivatives, which are contracts to (optionally or not) buy/sell assets in the future. cdos are a very niche product related to debt, but we're talking about etfs for stocks here. there are leveraged or inverse etfs, that do use this stuff, but that's completely different. if you are avoiding funds because of some connection to 2008 shenanigans you're handicapping your financial returns and possibly increasing risk.

* inventory doubled yoy to $4.45 billion.

nvidia stock is down 45% year-to-date on its poor financial performance - reduced margins and reduced revenue and profit. nvidia isn't lowering prices on 3000 cards, but they are not selling in the numbers nvidia expected, which is likely why they are pushing back the 4060/70 cards.  the 4080 and 4090 pricing intentionally doesn't overlap with 3000 cards.",10,,jasonwc,0

1671642300,"i accept the apology. the whole debate is just kind of meaningless though. does a hive mind exist and are there apple fan boys? absolutely. is there a ‚Äúcounter culture‚Äù that hates apple with or without any real merit? absolutely. could consumers easily achieve what they want with a cheaper or alternative os? most likely absolutely, very few individuals utilize their smart phone to its maximum capabilities (for instance i have a very advanced camera system on my phone that i never use). 

the only real question you should ask yourself is how do you make money off of this hive mind and apple fanboy stuff and the answer is simple. buy apple stock. i have been amassing it for the past decade and the company will eventually make me become a millionaire and that is the true reason as to why i stick to apple products. i get a free phone and my company gives me $1200 a year for at home technology. every year i go out and purchase either a new laptop, headphones, imac, ipad, etc so i can continuously monitor my investments and be a consumer of what i have close to half a million of my net worth tied into.",1,,Unlikely_You_9271,0
1671642809,"you want to look at a company‚Äôs growth, payout ratio (for the most part), and dividend growth.

watched a video recently comparing say bce to visa stock and after some time despite the massive yield difference, visa pays out more overtime (theoretically with it‚Äôs low payout ratio + high div growth).

chasing a high yield is a sure way to get burned in the long run if you‚Äôre young. not saying all high yielders are terrible but i realized as a young investor it‚Äôs best to find these dividend growers (7%, 10% 15% even 20%+ dividend growth). 

i love visa and microsoft because they have amazing share growth (powered by growing earnings), a growing dividend, and are buying back shares. 
gotta dig deep in these companies and understand that when buying a company you are responsible for identifying when it‚Äôs time to jump ship (if ever).

good luck.

##til:

* getnewclosure creates a module in which the closure executes
* scriptblocks called by a closure cannot reference variables created inside the closure. (surprising! workaround in the tricks section below.) example that demonstrates the different behavior of a scriptblock vs a closure made from the scriptblock:


        $which = 'nothing'
        $checkwhich = {$which}
        $scriptblock = {($which = $args[0]); &amp;$checkwhich}
        $closure = $scriptblock.getnewclosure()
        
        &amp;$scriptblock 'scriptblock'
        &amp;$checkwhich
        ''
        &amp;$closure 'closure'
        &amp;$checkwhich
        
    expected output:
        
        scriptblock
        scriptblock
        nothing

        closure
        closure
        nothing
        
    actual output:
        
        scriptblock
        scriptblock
        nothing

        closure
        nothing
        nothing

##tricks:

* hashtable of text operator -&gt; scriptblock that implements the operator
* operator-implementing scriptblocks reference variables created in a different scope, to avoid declaring parameters
* magic values 1, 0, and [big ugly number] control whether we're in part 1 or 2, and the ugly number is large enough that solving y=mx+b for y=0 shouldn't run into numerical inaccuracy.
* bigint division essentially has built-in [math]::floor, though [that might not actually be the correct math today](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zrscxm/2022_day_21_part_2_multiple_solutions_for_part_2/)
* `&amp; $h[$m].module $f[$o]` calls the operator scriptblock (`$f[$o]`) in the context of the closure's module (`$h[$m].module`). i haven't found this feature in the official ms documentation, but you can read more in a [seeminglyscience post](https://seeminglyscience.github.io/powershell/2017/09/30/invocation-operators-states-and-scopes).",2,,bis,0

1671660519,"meta software is in a sorry, sorry state.  air link using 5 year old rift software is an embarrassment.  auto update still doesn't and has never worked.  no ""update all"" button.  not even just an ""update"" button, have to go to individual store pages to update every all upon every update and be blasted by the extremely loud app trailers (loudest thing avail in the headset by far).  apps on the pc app routinely stall on exit and are unusable until restart.

i know a couple people who work at meta as swe's, very intelligent capable people who could fix these issues in a day if needed.  the incompetence comes from above and the enormity of the organization/red tape involved to get anything useful done.  the swe's like their 500k/year checks, and don't want to risk losing them by ruffling feathers, so they just wait to be told what to do and stare at their glaringly inefficient software, fully aware of it's bugs.  

of course, the real surprising thing is, despite the incredibly obvious and long standing problems with their software, they still have by far the best software ecosystem of any vr platform available right now.

this makes me feel like when apple enters the market, they are going to absolutely crush meta, because consumer-facing software is something they've always done exceedingly well.

unfortunate for me because i invested quite a bit of money in meta recently when i saw their stock go to such a low multiple.  a lot of people in the press complaining about how they are wasting their money on a pivot that people don't even want.  and that is clearly untrue, vr will be next the computing platform.  it will become small enough to fit into glasses (perhaps with faster cloud computing involved).  and our kids will look at smartphones and tv's the way we look at our parents fax machines and typewriters.

so i invested figuring ""the stock is undervalued, they're putting a lot of money into the right things, and they have the benefit of being first to market with a brand that is basically synonymous with vr, no average person can name any other brand"".

unfortunately the more i use their products, and even though quest pro is still my favorite headset i've used because of picture quality only, the more i realize that any other company (apple, microsoft, valve) that can get things done quickly and listen to consumer complaints, is going to win this battle.  i'm invested in many of those companies as well, but i wouldn't be surprised if my meta stock never makes a significant return.

it infuriates me that every ""tech"" interview u see zuck do, all these brainless interviewers do is talk about ""the future of the metaverse"" and not one person has the balls or product-experience to say ""hi, i actually spent significant time using your product, not just memorizing a list of bullet points for this interview, and i have made a list.  a list of obvious issues that are broken, as well as how long they have been broken for.  i'm here to ask you 1. if you are aware of them. 2. why they haven't been fixed yet. 3. if there are any plans to fix them soon, and if so how soon.

that would light some fire under him of suddenly the incompetency of the product became a public-facing talking point.  because you have to understand zuck doesn't run a tech company.  he runs a fortune 500 stock company.  the actual state of the tech has little effect on the stock price (up to a point), only the public perception of that tech matters.

right now all of the public conversation is on only two things:
is the metaverse actually the future?
is meta an evil privacy monster?

would be great to add ""hey, does this stuff even work?"" to that list.  if they cared about that, i have a feeling john carmack might have stuck around, at least as a consultant for long enough to see it happen before focusing exclusively on agi.",30,,rando646,0

keeping it simple still - say each of my nfts represent 1% of stock , others might represent 10% and also give extra permissions such as voting rights, therefore unlike usd (or eth or xdc tokens) the nfts are not interchangeable one for one (i.e non-fungible)

edit to expand in my original comment - when i say i get payment, this is more like a monthly payment over time for processing data - not just when i buy and sell the nfts  -

is it necessary to not install foo_playcount in order for fb2k to write the rating to the tags and not keep it in its own database.

not to mention money doesn't work like tech. the tech stays and continues to improve where all the money is. all the money is tied into both the bitcoin and ethereum ecosystems. this is why nothing has unseated grandpa featureless and slow ass bitcoin. nothing will beat bitcoin as a digital currency and a store of wealth. similarly, nothing will unseat ethereum as the king of smart contracts. this is a big part as to why ethereum will continue to be where most businesses choose to build. the only difference is now the businesses will build on ethereum's layer 2.

that doesn't mean alts won't find their place or there is even more money in some alts for the short/med term. you just need to make moves while understanding bitcoin and ethereum are going to stay right where they are. 

we've had over a decade to prove this wrong or even an alt coming close to challenging thesis. it isn't happening. the only possibility is ethereum may unseat bitcoin but even that is very unlikely. i'm guessing if it happened it would likely be short lived.

1672026026,"in simple terms related to stocks: an etf (exchange traded fund) is a portfolio of stocks that can be purchased under one ticker (ticker = $spy, $vpu, $aapl, $tsla, etc.). of this portfolio, you will get a sliver of each stock for every share purchased of said etf. 

the most popular example is the s&amp;p 500. two of the most popular etfs that track the s&amp;p 500 are $spy and $voo. purchasing h shares of these etfs will buy you a sliver of the top 500 publicly traded companies (based on a multitude of factors that aren‚Äôt all that important to the general investor). 

other examples are industry-specific, such as the $vpu, which tracks utilities (electricity, natural gas, water supply, etc.). 

then there are high-yield dividend etfs that track companies based on a decent-sized, consistent dividend, such as $vym. these typically pay close to 4% annually in dividends. (dividends = % of annual profits paid out per share of a company)

of course there are many other etf examples, but those are some basics. they can also come in the form of bonds, commodities, mutual funds, etc., but personally i found it easiest to begin with understanding stocks.",25,,xViipez,0

some people really like certain companies and understand them so they want to hold more of that specific stock.

picking individual stocks isn't always the worst thing in the world.",-1,,AhAhAhAh_StayinAlive,0
1672054145,"that's pretty reasonable, considering the price tag for the tech demo that introduced steve jobs to the gui was xerox having the opportunity to buy 100,000 shares of apple stock at a pre-ipo price of $10 per share. considering apple's ipo price was $22.00, that wasn't bad, and it closed at $29. remember that this is before a long series of ceos who were desperately trying to run the company into the ground.

but i digress. that opportunity to buy a million dollars' worth of stock wasn't any sort of a license or anything like that; it was just for a demo, because xerox parc was where all of the cool stuff was happening. yes, at xerox. stop laughing; it's not funny. okay, fine, cool stuff was happening at ibm, too. ... you know what, if you can't take this seriously, i'm just going to leave.

anyway, that price tag didn't come with a license, so xerox was waiting to see how the ""look and feel"" part of the apple-microsoft legal wars shook out, because if apple could take microsoft for basically stealing the mac interface for windows, then xerox could take apple for doing the same for the macintosh operating system. but, turns out look and feel doesn't get legal protection and turning a trash can into a recycle bin is just enough of a change to qualify as different. and so, xerox never got any more out of apple than a good purchase price on the stock.

no, i couldn't tell you when xerox sold that stock. hopefully before the end of the sculley administration, let alone michael spindler or gil amelio, who were desperately trying to sell the company to anyone dumb enough to buy it. yeah, there was a time when apple had about two weeks' of operating capital left. but, to close out the xerox story, because of stock splits and such (a 4-for1, a 7-for-1, and three 2-for-1s), that $10 per share would have been about a nickel per share today. you might think, ""wow, they're so dumb for selling,"" but you have to remember that at the end of 1997, apple was on the verge of bankruptcy, and that split-adjusted stock price was floating around fifteen cents. nobody knew if apple was going to be around in six months, and if a time-traveler told you that it would be the biggest company on earth, you'd have asked the guy where he gets whatever drugs he's smoking, so xerox probably sold before that.",28,,TheUmgawa,0

-age / industry / location: i'm 32, work in media, and i live in nyc.

-general goals: being able to pay for any future children's education, not having to work unless i want to, being able to live in comfort rather than on the cusp, being able to do favors for people i love. not freak out if i have to spend 1k on going to a family wedding or something. not worrying if something breaks. honestly, a huge point of stress is that i made such sporadic sums of money that i often would avoid socializing because i couldn't afford it, and now i want to stop doing that if someone asks me to dinner or something. if i am lucky enough, i want to be one of those grandparents who can comfortable afford to set up college funds for their grandkids. my stretch goal is to own a second house in rome, where a lot of my family is. that's probably not realistic though.  

-target fire age / amount / withdrawal rate / location: no idea about any of this, part of the problem is i have no clue what i should be working towards. 

-educational background and plans: ba degree, no future plans.

-career situation and plans: freelance for 10+ years, just got a real office job this year, will make almost 100,000 on the nose in 2023, if nothing changes.

-current and future income breakdown, including one-time events: made about 250,000 between 2019-2021, then 15k in 2022 (lol), and on pace to make 100k in 2023. matching 401k to 7%. 

-budget breakdown: varies wildly, some months my cc bill is 400, some it's 900. major events push me towards higher brackets (birthdays, holidays, vet appointments etc.). monthly home ownership expenses top out at 3,000 (very lucky situation). lucky also to be covered by my partner's very good health insurance. 

-asset breakdown, including home, cars, etc.: 

* i own a home that my parents helped me with the down payment for, but i am making all monthly payments. again, very lucky situation and i am very, very grateful. appraised at 800k. 

* i have 100,000 in savings (35k in hysa, 15k in a stupid low yield account that i need to keep active for my mortgage payments, and about 60k in accounts receivable because i gave my brother a massive interest-free loan that we're trying to figure out a good tax advantaged way for him to repay). 

* i also have 7k in a brokerage account (mostly apple stock and spy)

* i have about 60k in various ira (roth, sep, and trad. investments here are...weird. some good mutual funds, some blah mutual funds. some weird individual stocks that i feel weird about selling at the moment because they're half of what i paid for them.)

* i have about 100k in not great stocks that my grandfather set up for me when i was a baby. very grateful for that but they're very high fee. 

* i have about $1,500 in various crypto (it was about 5k at start. absolutely feel free to roast me for this)

-debt breakdown: my mortgage, which is about 600k. 

-health concerns: none that i know of at the moment.

-family: domestic partnership and eventual marriage to my partner, with whom i co-own the apartment.",2,,MdeGuise,0

house republican brian mast‚Äôs tilray purchase and subsequent sale at its ath in early 2021 (for returns of +563%) gets even sketchier when we remember that he bought $tlry before voting in support of the marijuana opportunity reinvestment and expungement (more) act in late 2020.

in november, lockheed martin won a $10.9b contract to modernize the air force's f-22s. house republican kevin hern, who sits on the house committee on the budget, bought lockheed martin stocks back in august. he bought another round, this time up to $100k, in $lmt just 2 weeks before this news.

house democrat kathy manning, who sits on the house committee on foreign affairs, bought up to $30k in $lmt stocks on october 22. just 2 weeks before the news!

house democrat zoe lofgren bought up to $15k in $lcid on october 13. now up 71%. in the past, rep. lofgren has co-sponsored legislative proposals for ev tax credits.

the us army first announced a $22b augmented reality deal with microsoft on march 31, 2021 and reiterated its commitment to this partnership in october. speaker nancy pelosi disclosed exercising 150 calls on march 19, 2021 at a strike price of $130. she's up 160%.

senator cynthia lummis bought up to $100k in bitcoin on august 16. this was during when the senate was actively drafting crypto regulations.

also during that time, senator pat toomey drafted amendments to those crypto tax regulations while he held crypto‚Ä¶

in july, when senate republican tuberville finally released his late financial disclosures, we found that he had sold up to $15k in microsoft stocks in late june. this was 2 weeks before the $10b jedi contract between msft-dod was cancelled. tuberville sat on the senate armed services committee privy to defense contracts.

related: house republican pat fallon, who sits on the house subcommittee responsible for reviewing dod software contracts, sold up to $250,000 in $msft right before jedi contract cancellation.

in july, house republican blake moore disclosed buying up to $60k in $rtx while sitting on the house committee on armed services. specifically, he was making these trades while sitting on the subcommittee directly responsible for reviewing defense tech contracts.

1672102347,"first of all you need to learn the difference between capitalism and socialism.  it really boils down to private ownership of property.  to ask such a question do you even know what capital is?   really ask another question, do you want the government owning everything including you?  i think not.  most people want their own sovereignty.  

you asked, so my answer is, i'm a capitalist because i do not think it's a good idea that everything is publicly owned and the government controls everything.  i prefer the economic system that allows me and others to own stuff and build wealth through capital investments.  

it's not about scale or class.  if you want you can take $150 bucks and buy yourself one share of apple stock.  that is capitalism.  you have taken your money (capital) and you have purchased one share of a company that is in business to generate a profit.    you do that and you prefer that economic system over government ownership of everything then you too are a capitalist.",1,,kcdashinfo,0

1672116538,"a supercomputer is a massive collection of individual computers that are closely linked together through a high speed interconnect network. it‚Äôs used to solve complex problems that single computers are simply not capable of solving in a reasonable amount of time. instead of running a program on a single computer, you can run it on thousands to do things like compute a difficult mathematical problem, comb through petabytes of data to find an answer to a problem, or simply do anything a single computer can do but thousands or millions of times faster.

there are basically two types of workflows done on supercomputers

1. running large simulations of some physical process like the evolution of galaxies or the fluid dynamics of a rocket engine. these types of processes require tons of computational power to run mathematical models of the physical process throughout time. each computer might be responsible for a particular cube of that simulation. if a galaxy, for example, moves from one cube to another, the computer responsible for one of those cubes would have to communicate with the computer responsible for the other to say ‚Äúhey i have a galaxy coming your way to please continue simulating it for me!‚Äù these types of workflows have lots of communication between computers because they have to constantly share information on what their little corner of the simulation is doing
2. big data workflows that comb through tons of data on a file system. these workflows are usually reading a ton of data to make associations between things. for example when a trader wants to figure out how apple stock responds when british petroleum stock tanks, they‚Äôll run a market simulation of historical market data to discover what tended to happen. these workflows are less computationally complex and tend to spend most of their time shuttling data to and from a file system. processors are so fast nowadays that even the most efficient systems can expect to use maybe only 50% of the cpu capacity. this is because io operations are always far slower than cpu operations. this problem is only getting worse as more data is being created all the time.",2,,LandonClipp,0

i know there is a reason my intuition is giving me these intrusive thoughts. 

who else thinks flexa collateralizing stable coins with amp is a big deal? 

if i recall isnt the new york fed conducting a trial with circle and usdc and mastercard and stuff where did i read that? ü§î 

some may call me optimistic, and i may very well just be passed off as a perma bull here, but i know deep down im a contrarian at my core, and digital payments technology may not be considered a deep topic for alot of people, as most do not understand how broken the amalgamation of systems that make up our monetary networks really are. laden with fraud, expensive.. exposed to manipulation.....the list goes on, i digress.

the evolution of technology has already lead to incredible breakthroughs that have changed the face of the earth in just the past 20 years, computers now fit in the palm of your hand.. and when the traditional payment infrastructure was conceived it took the space of an entire room for a computer that has a fraction of the computational capacity as our phones do now.

1672147036,"this is literally the same feeling i had in 2001 and 2008. lived through both. was not involved in investing at the time, but did own some apple stock and watched it get absolutely crumped. sold at the bottom.

in 2008 i was in a very different financial situation than i am today. it was all doom and gloom. i remember being in the gym, watching cnbc every day at 10 am, working out. watching the market absolutely collapse one day. just shredding it self like a car throwing a rod at 90 miles an hour.

everything was horrible, we were all going to be living in huts, wealth being destroyed, the financial system teetering on the edge of collapse, calamity, bailouts, stuffing money into mattresses, running to gold.

you could get bank of america stock at the time for something like a dollar a share. that was basically some high beta shitco of today. aig was selling for less than a dollar a share. worlds largest insurer. a dollar a share. 

people were saying berkshire was going under, it's exposure to the insurance industry was way too big.

complete dismal doom and gloom. stories of people throwing themselves off of buildings.

and yes, that was one of the possible outcomes in the ""choose your own adventure"" of life.

1999, i worked in media. daytrading was taking off. e*trade was the new thing, people were talking about how they were making fortunes daytrading. i remember the headlines of when the dow crossed 10,000, holy crap that number was so epic. 

the fomo was everywhere. gold was dead, selling for $200 an ounce. gold miners were going out of business, mines were closing. ""gold is done. we never seeing gold over $600 again.""

then asian financial crisis. international investing is dead, there's no future in emerging markets. china is a failing. 

when it's bad, it always feels like it's never getting better. when it's good, it never feels like it's going to end. 

the problem is the bad always feels worse than a good.

i think it's the long time equity trader walt deemer who was quoted as saying, ""when it's time to buy, you won't want to.""

nobody knows if it's going to be a lost decade. equities might not return. it could be like japan in the 90s. it could be a big leg down before another insane run up where aggregate pe of the s&amp;p hits 40 again.

but having lived through 2001, 2008. watching markets absolutely prolapse, walt was right. when it's time to invest, everything in your body tells you you don't want to. i'm not talking the urge to ""buy the dip,"" i'm talking the, ""i'm going to buy a five year cd instead.""

it's important to zoom out. look at the long chart, the chart from 1929 to today. look at how insignificant even the great depression was, world war ii, the 1960s and 70s. you don't even see the impact of those. they're just undulations on a line that curves upward.

maybe that line will plateau, maybe it will continue upward. but even over 10 years on my 401k, i still have real returns far above inflation. 

zoom out.",42,,kungpaocheese,0

1672162554,"&gt; the only capital tim cook owns is apple stock, and it's a negligible amount (0.02% of shares)

you're right, someone owning shares and stock in a trillion dollar company is in the same strata of society as someone living paycheck to paycheck

&gt; if owning shares in a company means you ""own capital"" then i guess my 401k makes me bourgeois.

the majority of the population in the developed world are middle class and online forums especially reddit are mostly middle class so you being petty bourgeoisie is not unlikely 

&gt; my issue is that the marxist definitions of worker/owner are really only ever really useful in an academic context.

sure if you're completely ignorant of the real world
&gt; people don't think in terms of ""relation to production"".

no but they act according to their relation to production. workers do not strike because they read about it and capitalists do not open a new factory because they read about it, they do so because their position in society and relation to production compels them to do so and marxism draws it's theory from the real world

&gt; there is no class solidarity between small business owners and jeff bezos

because they are not in the same class, the former are middle class/petty bourgeoisie, the latter is bourgeoisie. the middle class as a whole are not strong enough and do not own enough capital to facilitate their class interests and have to rely on either the bourgeoisie or the proletariat to do it for them. 

&gt; there is no class solidarity between small business owners and jeff bezos, just as there's no class solidarity between cashiers and the average ceo

i didn't say they were, you are ignoring the very thing that defines the working class and seperates them from the other classes 

&gt; the class of the wholly propertyless, who are obliged to sell their labor to the bourgeoisie in order to get, in exchange, the means of subsistence for their support. this is called the class of proletarians, or the proletariat.

the working class are the strata of society whos survival is determined on their ability to sell their labour for wages. ceos or any executive of a business do not fall into this strata of society because their survival is not dependant on their ability to sell their labour. they have significant reserves, capital by which they can sustain themselves. if tim cook is fired tomorrow and is unemployed he can live for centuries off of his financial reserves. if a member of the working class loses their job they face destitution and poverty

1672171943,"the best way to return on something like this is to just short the stock.  a delta of 1 with no expiry and then sell otm short puts to raise your entry basis.  especially if you have a longer term outlook like a recession that can last months, if not years.  while you will pay a small % in short fees, you can let the stock do whatever, while you gather premium and artificially raise your basis, like an inverted covered call.  

if you are targeting short momentum bursts (i.e. doing short term swing trades for a few days), you need to map out your target areas.  you can do this with daily/weekly/monthly lows, fibonacci targets, longer term moving averages, crosses of indicators to signal that momentum has shifted on a shorter time frame (say the 4hr vs. the daily).  since options can and will go to zero, you need to pay a bit more attention to your entries.  unlike stocks where, as long as you have sized appropriately, you can theoretically let the sit on the position forever until it turns green, options have a finite window to execute and this is why most people have a defined magnitude or a certain % gain they make on the trade where they close it and move onto the next setup.  for example, i was short nvda with a pds from $163 or so with a target of $150.  i took my profits on wednesday or thursday last week with a 30% return on my investment.  had i held, i could have effectively doubled my investment today, however, the future is unknown.  $nvda could have bounced and turned that 30% profit right back to entry.  targets are extremely important in options not to get awestruck by the possibility of 1000s of % return on $50-$100 input.",8,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0

1672178781,"i think we are red. $tsla should be starting to scare normal investors. it is the second ""big tech"" company to do a rapid no-bid decline. (the first was $meta earlier this year). there are other big tech companies that are down but they have generally been more gradual.

end of the year isn't a bullish setup. pre-market went from green to red despite the china news. lots of people attempted to play the ""santa rally"" that may abandon their positions when it becomes clear that isn't going to materialize.",4,,Bluewolf1983,0
1672179726,"they don't. but people who invest in stock like apple want to be able to justify buying the stock for a high price hoping to sell it for even more in the future. and for that they need to expect more growth. that's why stocks like them are called growth stocks. for a long time apple hasn't payed dividents, all the money people made trading their stocks was by getting more people interest in paying more and more money. it only started paying dividents very recently and honestly the dividents they pay are super low, and won't make you money. so all apple investors deperately need more people interested in buying apple stock for higher prices, they won't profit from it in any other way, as long as apple keeps the profits for itself instead of paying more reasonable dividents.",2,,SherifGames,0
1672180006,"that's the thing with growth stocks, you only make money with them when a greater fool pays more money than you for the stock. with this model, apple managed to increased the stock value of their company to an insane level, while keeping the profits for themselves. with that i mean that for a long time apple has payed zero dividents, so anybody invested in apple stocks needed the stock price to increase in value to make a profit. quite recently they started paying dividents, but those dividents are ridiculously low, even if you ignore that it's the most valuable company in the world we are talking about. so still the investors who hope to make money with apple stock need the apple stock to still grow in value. and to sell it to other idiot investors they need a justification for the price increase and make them interested in paying more.",1,,SherifGames,0

1672180305,"the way these people make their income is by being on all these boards of directors. that's paid work, and on the defense side it pays well. often for little more than attending an annual board meeting and enjoying good hotels, country clubs, dining, travel, etc. in the process. for example, al gore has been on the board of apple for many years. that means every year, he gets $250,000 in apple stock. and he is on \*many\* boards, and also has pension / retirement from the senate, from being vice president, and from various other careers along the way. book deals &amp; speaking engagements add to the inflow of wealth.

wealthy and successful people work. they enjoy it. in the case of the ufo characters, they love the modicum of celebrity and the attention from a group of people who hang onto their every word. to get *paid* to do that stuff is peak experience living.

poor and working-class people rarely understand the dynamics of the wealthy. sitting around counting your money on the computer is hardly a fulfilling life.",2,,OpenLinez,0

1672186560,"i would stop putting more money into these same stocks.  i would put any new money into an index fund. you are too overleveraged in the tech/growth sector.  and as we have seen, the same people are overleveraged the same stocks.  so when $meta went down people started to sell, $pypl and $amd to cover there loses.  now it has hit $tsla and $aapl is prolly next.  now some of these stocks will recover. 

if more people were diversified, than they could have sold some $xom or $bp stock when they needed the cash or if they wanted to take profits in 2022.  but unfortunately too many retail stock holders bought all the same stocks in the same sectors.  they don't own any of the market outperformers like $cat, $de, $mcd, etc. so there is a real possibility that we will get one more huge move down in the tech stocks as retail stock holders capitulate and just sell everything.",3,,drew-gen-x,0

1672234962,"i think people would be much better off if they applied some sort of trend following strategy with the wheel.  most of the ""help me! i sold a put on xyz"" posts i see, i pull up the chart and the daily, weeklies, and monthlies look like a dog's breakfast.  they are trading below all major mas, volume is piddly, and the chart is printing a series of lower highs and lower lows in succession.

honestly, i think the bare minimum to do the wheel (assuming you are treating it like a short-term swing trade vs. a longer term strategy) is to trade it when a) price is above a medium term moving average like the 50 or 63 (quarterly) and made a new confirmed pivot high over it, over the quarterly volume profile point of control, the weekly macd is green and rising, etc.  honestly, anything that shows that the medium term trend is steadily holding to rising...it can be whatever you want it to be but it has to show strength.

since the wheel is generally a bullish strategy (the expectation is that the puts will never be assigned) you want price to keep making higher highs and higher lows.  once it stops doing that, you shut it down and look for a ticker that is.  this is the reason so many people here and in /thetagang were so pro-wheel for most of 2020-2021 is because the market just kept going higher. it was a viable strategy that was fairly easy to implement and most were holding for a few weeks and closing out for profits by selling a put at support, getting assigned or having it expire worthless, and then selling the shares at the clear resistance point.  

people can still trade the wheel if that is what they are comfortable doing, but pick stocks that are strong, like energy and basic materials, or mining, for example.  don't trade $amd, $tsla, $nvda, etc. because it has to turn around.  sure, it probably will, but is that $1.00 in premium right now really worth 6-18 months of pain and torture until it does?  for most, i think not, based on the bi-weekly ""help!"" posts i see on a lot of options trading subs.",2,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0

1672237878,"if you read my posts you would have seen it but i'll reiterate:

an opinion based on rational thought, let me know if you disagree:

i don't believe gamestream is popular because i personally know a lot of people with the shield, none of which use use it for gamestream, i myself have 3 nvidia shields, only one has a controller sync'd to it. it also accounts for only a small amount of my shield usage, to further support my opinion, several people in this topic have commented they don't use their shield for gamestream,

reputable sources supporting my opinion:

linus from linus tech tips, one of the biggest tech youtube channels also supported my thought in that he doesn't use gamestream.

nvidia themselves has not marketed gamestream since the 2017 edition. when the 2019 was released, gamestream was literally the last thing mentioned in the marketing materials.

an additional rational thought i've yet to mention:

nvidia stock is not doing well, shareholders will demand to know what they are doing to cut costs. by sacrificing a service like gamestream that likely operates at a loss given it's a free service with no direct advertising. nvidia is saving money appeasing shareholders. as an nvidia shareholder myself it's something i would like to see as an investor, as a tech enthusiast i hate it.

1672253782,"the super wealthy do it to avoid paying taxes.

steve jobs famously got paid 1 usd per year, and the rest was in apple stock.

if you have 1b in stock, you can't purchase anything with it unless you liquidate it.  upon liquidation you pay capitals gains tax, so it's in your best interest not to.

what they do, is take that 1b of stock, and go to an investment bank and request a low interest loan (1-2%) using the stock as collateral. the investment bank gladly accepts since it's an appreciating collateral and basically low/no risk.

now i get 1b in cash to spend, since you don't tax loans, however i have a monthly repayment to make. interest payments alone are millions per month.

what i do, is take 700m of the 1b, and invest it with a slightly higher risk. like commercial building rent. you usually can make 5-7% or more on that investment which gives you 10m+ per month.

so now you can safely repay your loan, and have some extra to live off. you'll pay some taxes, but nowhere near what you would have done had you liquidated the stocks. also at the end of the payment of the loan, you get back your 1b in stock.

but wait, you only used 700m, you still have 300m to spend. that's how you buy your yacht, mansion, private island etc.

this is all explained very simply. in reality the ultra wealthy hide this far better. they use llcs and offshore companies to do the work. it's difficult for the average person to track down exactly how much money is spent.",24,,teems,0

1672264341,"&gt;	there is no point in putting your funds into a company once it reaches a certain level of cash flow and balance except for purely speculative reasons.

i disagree. there absolutely is. these companies should be considered stable long-term investments. and they should pay dividends. my microsoft stock doesn‚Äôt grow wildly year by year, but it reliably pays a dividend that exceeds the interest i would receive in any other stability-focused investment. 

i currently own all of $1000 worth of apple stock and i‚Äôm not planning to ever sell it. actually, i have about the same amount in apple and microsoft, and from just now looking at my portfolio i see the stocks are remarkably similar. apple is only a little bigger by market capitalization right now, a difference of only around 15% with both in the vicinity of $2t. microsoft is paying a higher dividend than apple though neither is really impressive right now, but at least they beat the interest on my checking account.

1672273774,"well i do remember 2008, apple stock was super high because steve jobs was doing great with revitalizing the macantosh, everyone wanted those cool designed expensive computers.  they also had the ipod and the itunes store  which was booming and growing sales every year.  the company was in great financial shape too, no debt and major cash reserves.  the stock price was diving though, maybe because of the financial crisis?  the phone.... people really didn't think it was going to work out if i remember correctly their first year sales were weak but i think 2008 was when the iphone 3g came out which was a huge hit but even so looking at their 2008 4th quarter sales:

sold 2,611,000 macintosh¬Æ computers   
sold 11,052,000 ipods  
sold 6,892,000 iphones compared to 1,119,000 in 4th quarter 2007

worldwide phone sales exceeded 1 billion units that year and iphones were about 2.5% of those  


so i'd argue they were more of a computer/personal audio device company still in 2008 and their stock value actually made sense for the p/e ratio they had.  

apple 4th q 2008 eps $1.01 and expected to rise (which it did),  vs teslas highest quarterly eps $.95 (apparently tesla just recently started making profits in the last 2 years) 

and lastly apple was not worth more than all other phone companies

just looking at one of the big ones from 2008 

nokia valuation in 2008: $59.29 b  
apple valuation in 2008: $75.99 b  
meanwhile tesla peaked at over $1,000 b in valuation which to me is ridiculous now its down to like $300+ b which is better but still seems high to me

apple stock price at the end of 2008: 	$2.60   so yeah the stock market didn't have a lot of faith in apple/the iphone quite yet.   now the price is over $100

i see your point, theres a lot of hope and faith with tesla that they will perform like amazon did after decades of little to no profit, but its not like apple which already had a steady revenue stream without the iphone and actually did have some fans (mostly macintosh or ipod fans) but not enough to overly inflate their stock price which was $2.60 at that time and falling.     and you're right, i was a bit skeptical  about apple iphones, they could never break 10% of the pc market and the cell phone market was hard to crack, never would predict that apple would be thought of as a phone company thats for sure, still i did buy my first smartphone in 2008 and it was an iphone.

1672335593,"&gt;while it may be hypothetical at this point, it is trivial for a government to implement one-token one-vote on a cbdc.

my sense was that cbdcs will increase velocity, maybe reduce friction and allow for much stronger surveillance. but not necessarily that they would facilitate governance, given users will already be effectively kycd by the government. so if your ssn is tied to your financials it's not an issue to keep operating under one person one vote, vs. crypto. now if crypto gets slammed with draconian regulations and all wallets become kycd then ironically it may be easier to enforce on chain democracy ü§î. here's hoping for some better did implementation.

&gt;human stake in society will be reduced to the mere dollars they can generate for the economy

i fear we're already at that stage 

&gt;i agree most governance tokens today are identical to the legacy system they replace, existing to preserve the creators wealth and influence, adding no new value.

despite the anxiety that crypto will be classed as securities, i guess in the case of governance that tokens are more akin to the voting rights in public companies vs. participatory democracy. the difference being the role of validators/delegators. but what utility does my holding of aapl stock hold beyond speculation and dividends?

this baby is not even in proper nosedive. every quarter on a clock, musk would have to go out and ask who's buying automotive company that's just lost 67% of value. why the hell is buying it now? he'll basically do himself what darkpools are supposed to do when shorting stock - keep throwing small orders at ever smaller value. or, he takes personal loans that are leveraged against tesla stock he owns, but the shareholders may not like it when banks go for the option musk waived and do [due diligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/due_diligence). or he pitches own low value on the loan to keep them away from quantifying how much his company would be worth to someone else.",3,,ObliviousAstroturfer,0

1672425348,"i see you like to double down.

the op you replied to did not have any issues with their math.  maybe you can just admit you did not read their point clearly.  you then went to a percentage argument, 10% up, 10% down and asked why cost basis mattered.  i explained why.  sentiment and dilution.  that is why cost basis matters.

you then highlight the exact opposite of a reverse split.  i loved when my apple stock split.  like you said, i had more shares and the price felt low.

you get used to that $400, now $40 seems cheap.  next thing you know it, you are up to $80 and as you stated you have more shares.

you went on a tear about rs calculation when you clearly were not understanding how people feel with a certain cost basis.  

why do you continue to stack silly argument over silly argument when all you had to say was, yeah, i may have not seen their original point.

there is no ""gotcha"" moment.  i think it is fair to discuss the mechanics of the conversion and reverse split.  but the third bullet in aas release was to ask the shareholders to continue to raise money.  if they dilute to 300 or 516 million shares, then someone with a cost basis of $30 pre rs will then be sitting at $300 with the same or similar float as we have today.  why would anyone recommend that?  even at a cost basis of $5, i would hate to look at a $50 cost basis.

one thing to keep in mind is that investment is not just ""start with x, end with y.""  both she and her husband draw salaries, and prudent investment has you continually feed the funds over time. 

start with a million, add 250k a year (assuming they live off one salary and invest the other), and even with a very good but not outstanding gain of 9% on average, it would take only about 40 years to break 100 million.

1672447267,"corporate taxes are generally considered very inefficient by economists. anything a company generates gets taxed on the individual level at some point. but companies do things to avoid the tax that costs them money through unproductive actions (so less economic growth) - like apple holding a fortune overseas in low yield investments to avoid us taxation until there was a tax holiday. 

because any benefit generated from companies can eventually be taxed at the individual level there are 2 critiques that make some level of sense. 1. taxing foreign nationals - if an american buys apple stock then when they sell or get a dividend they pay us taxes. however, if you live in another country then that country gets the benefit - there are tax treaties where the us often gets some tax revenue from this but it can often be less than locals pay. so it can be argued it is a way to tax those people. 2. individuals delay their taxation allowing their wealth to grow tax free. this is the whole ""billionaires don't have to sell"" idea. so it's a roundabout wealth tax.",5,,jimjones1233,0

since twitter was owned largely by big institutional funds, that's how the twitter acquisition went -- elon offered a price that was way too high to reasonably refuse so the board had to go through with a recommendation to sell

no actual owner is *forced* to sell, though, any entity that's a shareholder gets to decide what ""their own interests"" are themselves -- many individual twitter shareholders did not sell and instead opted to hang onto their shares, just not nearly enough to prevent elon from buying a controlling interest

if zuckerberg retains controlling voting power over meta stock then he never has to sell it, even if meta goes down to zero and he's offered trillions of dollars -- that's the whole point of retaining voting control

1672506616,it seems like you‚Äôve already got one foot in the door. did you have unlimited pto in the uk? how volatile is the stock? apple stock would potentially be volatile compared to a smaller just listed company. what‚Äôs their projections looking like? if the company is expected to do poorly the stock valuations may be lower than you expected. it‚Äôs your decision at the end of the day and you can only do what‚Äôs right for you but i was just trying to get you thinking about the pros and cons of each,1,,gary183,0

1672512604,"people really think elon will recover this loss by next yearüòÖ, bro the economy is tanking and everything become overvalued during covid is gonna tank so fucking hard at least for a few years‚Ä¶ (elons still rich he‚Äôs got over $100b) question people be asking is when are these companies going to hit bottom‚Ä¶

i‚Äôm remember cathie woods (worst hedge fund manager ever) and a few other parading tesla earlier this year saying tesla is ‚Äúundervalued and it will hit $4,000 by 2023‚Äù (or some shit along the lines)‚Ä¶ no company or business entity even governments are gonna get out of inflation‚Ä¶ petty much the economy is overvalued in a sense where prices are collapsing and overall equites are diminishing‚Ä¶

i honestly just put stock alerts and plan to slowly add them to my portfolio:
$amzn bottom entry target $65 
$aapl i‚Äôm thinking $100 maybe $80 (but that‚Äôs seems high improbable)
$goog anywhere between $70 - $50
$msft seems to performing well compared to others $170 is my entry (but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go that low)
$tsla for me looks well at $75 - $50

honestly there‚Äôs no telling how low a company can go or even the chances of it to go there, always nice to have entry point set in mind so if the opportunity arises you can invest‚Ä¶ but so far all gas/oil stocks are performing well with no drop in market vaule, in fact $xom $oxy $cvx $shel along with a few retailers $jnj $wmt $pg $cost $hd $ko $pep $unh are still out performing the rest of the market‚Ä¶ some have recovered from previous dips and others are still not affected‚Ä¶.

it‚Äôs all a fugazi, if someone‚Äôs losing in one corner there‚Äôs going to be someone winning in the other, you just have to fluctuate and focus on where the money is going and how much potential does that company have‚Ä¶ buy low sell high‚Ä¶ unfortunately for tsla ‚Äúbag holders‚Äù elon convinced most of his followers/fans (who think they experts on ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù) plung a shit ton of money into overvalued shares and now they‚Äôre stuck and reluctant to sell‚Ä¶ he probably had keen idea of the future dip and just baited morons to buy into an overvalued company‚Ä¶ and now they all get defensive about tsla

as traders you shouldn‚Äôt be defending a company or its reputation, you should simply focus on the potential outs, of buy low and sell high, not buy when a rich asshole tweets to buy‚Ä¶ as traders we have no obligation or any loyalty to any company we invest in. we should simply rely on the idea and strategy of receiving the best outputs of our money‚Ä¶ and defending controversial ceo‚Äôs is just idiotic, they don‚Äôt know us (general public) nor do they give or ever will 2 shits about us",11,,Particular-Ad-3411,0
1672516392,"you posted this under a comment which was comparing current crime to other cities. comparing to 80s and 90s does nothing to reassure me that the city is comparatively safe or recently improving.

that's like saying meta stock is currently a good investment based only on that it was $20 at one point and now it's $120.",-10,,z0234,0
1672518626,"well i think you need to look at the percent holdings for institution vs retail differently.

institutions use it as a form of balance for the desired performance of stock basket they made (etf or mutual fund). so they generally hold more of stocks that perform well, are more stable in price volatility, and have good future projections with growth and prosperity. hence why all the major institutions hold substantially more apple stock than bed bath &amp; beyond.

in fairness, in the past year or so apple was the most valuable company in the world so it does make sense. but at the same time, knowing that massive comparison, the amount of holdings for bbby is not that low comparably. like apple being valued in trillions and bbby being in millions currently, that's like a double order of magnitude difference... holy fuck! lol. it's really big, that's all you have to know.

now with retail, our % holdings hit more because we have less invested capital overall. so it matters what we invest in, and how much. that's why the advise of only invest what you can afford to lose hits home.

for me personally, the account that i hold bbby in is only valued at $19k right now (i've probably invested around 30k in it). bbby for me is only down 47% or roughly $8.3k of that loss so far, and it represents 67.8% of my portfolio of this account. but i have about 7 other spread out investment accounts between my employer, my retirement, crypto, etc. none of those other ones have bbby in it.

so yes, diversification is important; and so is risk awareness, and loss / gain hedging... and - you get the idea.

happy new year to you too!, be safe and hope your investments go well next year :)",1,,Whoopass2rb,0
