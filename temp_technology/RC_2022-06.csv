1654059024,"was reading through the thread you made and while an interesting perception, it missed so many points and is absent of reality because you're thinking of every employee as 1 unit that is equal to the next employee. 

each employee brings a certain amount of labor into the pool and some bring more labor and more profit for the company. take more responsibility, get paid more is usually how it goes. it's not going to be an even 1/150k for each employee. the amount stock costs isn't related to just capital + labor. it's a speculation of the market and the company in how they will perform for future investment. 

for example, twitter had their stock go up when elon said he was going to buy it for $54.20 a share. it wasn't that the employees worked harder to make it worth more. the stock price is a market estimation of subjective worth that isn't even based on how much a company makes until they reveal their quarterly earnings.

your assumption about how it would take so much money per employee is only part of the equation. you'd also have to see how much money each employee brought to the pool in the first place, and this is why the higher up employees go, the more they get paid, because they bring more for the company with their decision making.

in other words, you're looking at two employees, and if one brings 1 million and the other brings 100, you think it's fair to put them both together and then say they both deserve half a million. it doesn't work like that and you can't even judge the price on that alone.

all you can do with something like stock is look at the price, realize they give employees discounts in a lot of companies, and then determine the amount of dividends given each quarter and the casual growth of the stock when a company keeps doing well.

in the last 5 years, apple stock has gone up about 290%. what do you think an employee would get if they casually put money on the side every paycheck or even every quarter to buy some of it?  what do you think would happen if they had that extra money and then sold the stock before the market went down and then bought again when it started to pick up?

employees have the option to really make it big, not work for apple, and start their own business, but they don't take the chance and don't bother to even buy the stock.",0,,Erwinblackthorn,0

broadly speaking it comes from microsoft becoming more valuable as a company, but that's because people are willing to pay more for their products. and the moment in which they get said product and use it as intended, the chain gets broken. because they have received a particular service or product they use, instead of just owning something to resell later",6,,Pr0Meister,0

[yeah, i was sloppy in language. the $612 billion a month is the rate at which people are feeling less wealthy.  you're raising a point i was not focusing on. an equity meltdown doesn't change the amount of money in circulation. equities are 100% money supply neutral, even with fees, dividends, deposits and withdrawals, its's all shifting money around.  just to make it clear an example: on the stock market. say a has $0, b has $100 and c $150, in total $250 cash and there are no stocks. a buys aapl at $0 at ipo, sells to $b at $100, $b sells to c at $150. a has now $100, b $150 and c $0, and c has the aapl stock bought at $150. so $250 in cash, $150 in stock. so we went from $250 cash to $250 cash plus $150 in equity value.  now you can replace stock with houses, paintings, whatever you like.  my main point is still the psychology effect: though no money is created, it's creating a feeling of wealth and influences the willingness to spent money and how they look at the future, the willingness to invest in businesses etc.  thought via borrowing against stock (gains) money is actually indirectly created, i don't have statistics on that (elon musk for the twitter deal, softbank with its alibaba stock). the easiest most visible one is retail margin. in april 2022 it was (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/walcl)).  to be honest: this post started me thinking abut defaults. what happens there? i take out a loan of $100 (someone lends it to me). i spent the $100 and i don't pay it back (i default). the amount of money didn't change either.

[tgt drop was a panic overcorrection.  you shouldn't have counted on a further retail collapse after the already panic sell.  especially after bj's showed they were still making money (best comparison for cost imo).  aapl prints money from their app store &amp; content sales: $35 billion in airpods alone so don't know why you'd bet that hard against them.  amd is a chip business in a world where there is a chip shortage due to raw material acquisition issues... that's just a pure gamble on them being able to sell for a higher price on lower supply more than they lose on the reduced capacity costs.  you should be doing paper trades (or use $1,000) before you're throwing this kind of money at options.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v237qz/i_give_up_i_literally_buy_calls_it_tanks_i_buy/ias097d/)

[spx 0dte only using credit spreads.  i don't use any indicators. i have a custom google spreadsheet that gives me percentile ranges for possible shifts in spx over a 25 year timespan and i enter based on a mix of my percentile calculations and intuition. i also calculate max delta from high/low using percentiles and use that to make statistically sound strike placements.  i use near 100% of my capital per trade but strongly respect my 2x stop loss (which is generally less than 5% of my capital). i have a &gt; 92% win rate. my contract sizes are usually around 10-15.  sometimes i leg into an iron condor, but that's fairly rare. i generally run to expiry. sometimes i close early if i'm not confident.  in regards to entry timing, i basically watch for the volatility in the morning. i generally don't enter until mid day when the market has picked a solid direction. on the first turn i sell a spread in the direction of the original trend for max credit assuming it won't breach my percentile assumptions (usually around 3% max move per day).  not sure if there's much else for me to add.](/r/daytrading/comments/v26mrf/may_trading_results_spx_0dte_only/iaqp7hq/)

&gt; overall, gpu unit shipments decreased by -6.2% from last quarter, amd shipments decreased by -1.5%, intel‚Äôs shipments decreased by -8.7%, and nvidia‚Äôs shipments increased 3.2%.

so 

* nvidia sales up
* amd sales down very slightly, they were stale as nvidia stock started to stablize, and they clearly needed a price adjustment/refresh, which they got.
* intel ships gpus?  (i'm guessing the these numbers include igpu as they talk about dgpu later, thats really out of scope for this comparison.)

so uh, dgpu shipments *up*.

1654156168,"this is wrong due to a limited understanding of markets.

like it or not, and irrespective of what one chooses to believe, the correlation between crypto and stocks is very high.  the correlation between the nasdaq composite index (chosen as a proxy for tech stocks) and price of btc (chosen due to liquidity) over the past five years is 0.91, which is huge in statistical terms; the maximum theoretical value for this coefficient is 1 meaning perfect correlation.

same correlation for a shorter period of last three years holds at 0.89; 0.70 for past year - still very significant in statistical terms; and back to 0.86 since beginning of 2022 meaning that this strong correlation holds during the current crisis.

now, investing in stocks is definitely not a zero-sum game, no matter what one thinks it looks like (i.e. ""the rich get richer while common folk lose money"", etc). long term investing in a diversified portfolio has historically and consistently provided significant positive returns based on profits and growth of issuers, in turn based on economic growth (which historically is positive) and which is ultimately based on technical, scientific, organizational, etc progress. what this means is that *everyone* holding stocks long term can make money; investor a making a profit by selling high to b doesn't mean the latter looses money provided he has enough patience; he will be able to sell even higher to c and so forth. boy, this sure looks like a pyramid scheme? no, as it's all based on long term economic growth (the caveat here is that long term economic growth might evaporate forever when the big asteroid hits, nuclear war starts, covid-26 proves a lot deadlier than covid-19, or due to global warming, etc, but we're working on a going concern hypothesis for the economy and the human race in this post; if nuclear war starts then crypto returns would probably be a lesser concern). 

sure, your cousin bob might have lost money holding gamestop for two weeks but that would be different from diversified long-term stock investments; it adds stock picking to the mix and replaces long term investing with short term trading, both of which have shown mixed results (both good and bad) depending on many many factors.

the above-mentioned correlation shows that crypto is following a similar pattern to the stock market. what this all means is that no, holding crypto long term is not a zero sum game. even though bitcoin has no underlying assets to base its value on like facebook or apple stock, its correlation with them seems to ensure a similar price pattern.

so to me it looks like everyone stands to make money long term if the above premises hold (i know this is a bold statement and i'm not even joking here). sure crypto has some *game over* scenarios of its own: restrictive regulation gets passed in major jurisdictions; crypto does not live up
to its expectations in terms of practical uses, people get bored of it and move to the next best thing; a major techincal flaw is uncovered (is this even possible? probably not), etc. but we're operating in a going concern scenario for the crypto market in this post. also, a black swan scenario might not trigger the complete fall of crypto but just its de-correlation from the stock market.
this is not impossible and needs to be taken into account even though we're not seeing anything related to it currently; it would be interesting, though. 

there's also strong correlation between individual coins. i looked at correlation between ethereum and bitcoin and found 0.93 for past five years, 0.92 for past three, 0.94 for past year and 0.95 ytd. sure, cousin bob's shitcoin deluxe might have a different pattern and be less correlated with anything, but we're talking about general trends here (enron stock also showed a different pattern than the general stock market at some point, for example).

so does this mean that holding crypto is the same as holding stocks? no. standard deviation of bitcoin daily returns for the last five years was 4.17%, significantly higher than the 1.49% of the nasdaq composite. this means higher volatility for bitcoin so both a potential to make much more money and the potential to lose much more money than with stocks. the latter is actually very important as it's the reason people are selling too early even though theoretically long-term holding is the key (hard to follow when you're down 50%, fair enough).

interestingly enough, as bitcoin correlates more with the stock market, its volatility goes down; standard deviation of daily returns was 3.89% over the past three years, 3.60% over the last year and 3.49% ytd. it's still significantly over the nasdaq composite but going down. 

same trend for ethereum, but higher overall values: 5.10% for last five years, 4.90% over last three years, 4.31% for last year and 4.16% ytd. the window of opportunity is slowly closing for big gains from these two, but it looks like there's still plenty of time. smaller coins may have both lower correlation and higher volatility compared to the stock market and to btc/eth, but thread carefully so you don't end up owning shitcoin deluxe and wondering what went wrong.

also, let's be clear what a zero-sum
game is. futures trading is a zero-sum game. there's a buyer and a seller of a futures contract which enter the trade at a certain date and at a fixed price; when the contract settles at the expiry date and at the settlement price, one party gains an amount equal to the other party's loss right then and there (this is a simplification).

the bottom line is that ""zero-sum game"" is an actual concept in finance, and it is not cousin bob's loss buying his shitcoin from someone else at a high price and selling low two weeks later.",2,,moderatelyremarkable,0

[when learning you‚Äôll definitely make really stupid trading decisions. most grab the basic knowledge and have small success and think theyve got it figured out - they always blow their accounts.  start again. run a tight 5% stop loss. trade indexes only, like spy, while you learn market movements. trade once per day. aim for 10% profit.   the stop loss will save your ass and force you to enter on high prob setups only. do not trade until the next day, never revenge. the index will make you research the market forces, not the p/l screenshots or the conditions of your local dg. the one trade per day rule will force you to make a plan and strategy to execute and teach you patience. the lower profits will train you to prefer consistency over high adrenaline moves.   do this for 1-2 years all the time studying more and more. build an account. then slowly add trades.  once youve tasted daily 10%. you wont care much for giant moves after earnings etc](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v2lsgv/why_im_taking_a_break_from_tradingoptions/iauavpu/)

1654181053,"[yeah, i was sloppy in language. the $612 billion a month is the rate at which people are feeling less wealthy.  you're raising a point i was not focusing on. an equity meltdown doesn't change the amount of money in circulation. equities are 100% money supply neutral, even with fees, dividends, deposits and withdrawals, its's all shifting money around.  just to make it clear an example: on the stock market. say a has $0, b has $100 and c $150, in total $250 cash and there are no stocks. a buys aapl at $0 at ipo, sells to $b at $100, $b sells to c at $150. a has now $100, b $150 and c $0, and c has the aapl stock bought at $150. so $250 in cash, $150 in stock. so we went from $250 cash to $250 cash plus $150 in equity value.  now you can replace stock with houses, paintings, whatever you like.  my main point is still the psychology effect: though no money is created, it's creating a feeling of wealth and influences the willingness to spent money and how they look at the future, the willingness to invest in businesses etc.  thought via borrowing against stock (gains) money is actually indirectly created, i don't have statistics on that (elon musk for the twitter deal, softbank with its alibaba stock). the easiest most visible one is retail margin. in april 2022 it was (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/walcl)).  to be honest: this post started me thinking abut defaults. what happens there? i take out a loan of $100 (someone lends it to me). i spent the $100 and i don't pay it back (i default). the amount of money didn't change either.

&amp;#x200b;

but now, during a market glut and downtrend, we're the only tech stock that kept the performance from 2021 in 2022.

amd stock 1 year- 35.53%

nvidia stock 1 year- 14.57%

a 16% split on the 3 month chart as well.

do you know the significance of amd now doing better than nvidia almost every week nowadays?

1654191280,"if you look at them as an investment, there are safer ones or even more exciting speculative ones. say you own an ungraded cib ocarina of time - worth about $300 right now. if you'd sold it in 2015 it was probably $100. 

so sure the game has increased 3x in value in 7 years. if you sold for $100 and bought movie tickets and a case of beer you probably feel dumb.

but if you'd bought shares of vanguard's vtsax fund for about $50 each with that $100, you'd have something currently worth about $220, which imo is negligible as a spread. if you'd bought apple stock, $578. amazon - $787. tesla - $1,600. not sure if those account for stock splits and dividends either but i don't think they do, so the numbers are low.

if you'd bought .3 bitcoin you'd have $9,200 right now and $19,000 if you'd gotten out six months ago.


there are people who make money off games. if you've got something rare in immaculate condition and it brings you joy then i'd say don't feel bad about keeping it, just physically protect it with a premium case and consider trying to insure it. but i'd say don't be inspired by fomo on a retirement vehicle.

[the ev market is growing... it's possible that ford can take market share based on raw numbers but tesla still grows.  if the market for ev's is 1 million vehicle sales per year and tesla sells 800k and ford sells 200k, that's 80/20%.  if the market for ev's grows to 2 million vehicle sales per year and tesla sells 1.6 million and ford sells 400k, that's still 80/20.  both are growing but the issue is one becomes more profitable while the other is still losing a shit ton of money. how much longer can ford hold on at that pace?  so ford can sell more while tesla still benefits. the only time market share matters here is if the market is stagnant. when the demand is consistently growing, everyone has room to grow.  selling ev's for these legacy automakers will be actively losing them money for the foreseeable future. but they will continue doing so because they have no choice: the markets are taking shape and people want ev's &gt; ice.  you seem to think people don't understand your point. your point, which you aren't articulating very well is that the stock performance of ford is not the same as ford as a company and how they operate and that even if ford loses money, their ability to compete with tesla will still affect tesla's valuation.  the problem is the market for ev's, as i've stated, is growing at a rapid rate. it's just a matter of who can survive the longest to where they can be profitable. and that is why people are investing heavily into tesla because as of now, they are the only profitable ev maker with higher margins than traditional ice manufacturers. even if ford manages to become profitable, the shit tesla is coming out with in terms of software, insurance, ai being used for robotics, fsd, etc., has immense value. i don't see it as just vehicles so that's a separate discussion.  really, the point here is that tesla can still grow with or without ford's success because the market for ev's is still in its early stages. there will be ev makers that end up bankrupt and unable to continue operations so they can pump up more ev's all they want but at some point, you need to be profitable. tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy just four years ago.](/r/stocks/comments/v3d5r9/volkswagens_race_with_tesla_will_be_tight_herbert/iay94zf/)

&gt;convince me not to start dcaing $2400 biweekly into individual stocks for the long term of 5+ years.

buy the haystack rather than finding the needles. picking individual stocks means you believe the entire world is incorrect about the price of them and, unless you have some undeniable knowledge that the stock should be priced differently, you're speculating.

1654277469,"i haven‚Äôt worked in the industry so i‚Äôm entirely willing to admit i could be wrong. 

estate tax isn‚Äôt required unless you have a reasonably large estate. ~&gt;$12 million in 2022. 

the stepped up basis rule does have a direct effect on inheritance taxes. 

example: 
you buy $100k worth of apple in 2002. 
by 2022 it‚Äôs worth $5 million. (i didn‚Äôt actually look at apple stock price). 

scenario 1: you sell and then immediately die. 
you have to pay long term cap gains on $4.9 million. 
your kids pay 40% on the leftovers. no estate tax because it‚Äôs under $12million. 

$4.9 million cap gains* 20% cap gains rate = $980,000
inheritance = $4,020,000 - 40% inheritance tax ($1,608,000)
net to heirs = $2,412,000


scenario 2: you don‚Äôt sell but you still die. 
kids get it at stepped up basis so no cap gains but still have to pay inheritance tax. it‚Äôs under 12 million so no estate tax. 

40% of $5 million = $2 million

net to heirs $3,000,000. 

you pay more inheritance tax in scenario 2 but less overall. even if you take estate taxes into account (let‚Äôs say it became $20million instead of just $5 million), you still end up ahead because you don‚Äôt have to pay estate taxes on the first 12 million. the rate is significantly lower than the 37% inheritance tax rate until you get to really large sums. even then i‚Äôm sure the math works out to it saves you money. maybe not as much as everyone seems to make out, but it is worth it.",0,,musicantz,0

but losses on chip futures are *absolutely* a part of the market dynamic

so, even just looking at the nvidia stock price (nvda) the prices are down a bit more than the rest of the market in the last week

i think a few of your singular points are wrong:

&gt; everyone stores whatever they earn in usd(false)

technically true but mostly, effectively false. hard assets are volatile and most people who attempt to escape inflation through the stock market, but this is risky, and doesn't help people who don't have access to financial tools, know-how, or enough cash over a long enough time frame to beat volatility.

it also doesn't account for the fact that the biggest players escaping dollar weakness through the stock market are professionals, or at least dedicated to understanding what they are doing. asking the average person to do that is too much just to escape inflation. 

&gt; assets bought by usd have outperformed bitcoin 3:1 (nvidia)

you've cherry picked the asset *and* the time-frame for this example, if you even want to go so far as to label nvidia stock an *asset* rather than a *security.*

&gt; fiat is tightly controlled and backed by the whole damn nation

bitcoin is loosely controlled and backed non-violent competition. it has guarantees institutions cannot make.

&gt; median savings account is 5000 usd, everyone stores what they earn in inflation beating assets.

this leads back into my first point, but what you say here is plainly wrong and contradictory. if a savings accounts has a median of 5000 usd in it, it by definition is *not* stored in an inflation (if we are referring to usd inflation) asset. apart from that technical contradiction, if what *you mean* to say is coherent, its also not true. the majority of people in the u.s. do not save outside the dollar.",2,,Matt-ayo,0
1654391905,"ah yes, another ""anything a human feels is valid"", ""nothing is harmful"" take.

&gt;the antipsychotics caused obesity ‚Äî 50 pounds of new weight ‚Äî and the feeling that she was losing control of her forearms and her neck.

no, she ate too much food and likely lived a sedentary lifestyle.

&gt;but she was also bartering sex for drugs. it was blurrier than prostitution but no softer: men in states of addiction and states of rage; she absorbing their anger, their brutality; a man battering her in the shower; she waking up in a costume of florid bruises.

-

&gt;she was arrested more than once. she tussled with cops; she raved and slammed her head against the wall of a solitary-confinement cell. her third arrest was for stealing electronics to trade for drugs.

sounds like a normal, well-adjusted person making healthy rational choices.

&gt;after an abortion, a voice told her he would remove her fingers ‚Äúone by one by one.‚Äù

this is just a ""quirky neurodivergent behaviour"", [nothing](https://thoughtcatalog.com/lorenzo-jensen-iii/2017/10/37-schizophrenic-people-describe-the-terrifying-voices-they-hear/) to [worry](https://people.com/celebrity/man-allegedly-kills-seven-people-in-seven-weeks-after-hearing-voices-in-his-head/) [about](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/son-of-sam-the-eerie-enigma-of-killers-who-%25e2%2580%259chear-voices%25e2%2580%259d). 

&gt;she flushed the drugs down the toilet morning by morning and evening by evening, careful that if anyone checked her med case they would find the right number of pills remaining.

-

&gt;she shed pounds.

the author thinks this is from the lack of drugs and not from days/weeks/months of farm labour and healthier eating habits at the psychiatric clinic.

&gt;she felt she was starting to manage her turmoil and convert it to determination, and she credited roller derby, where mayhem had to be marshaled and deployed.

god, is this a script of a new netflix show? of course it's *roller-derby* - hottest thing for 20-something urban women.

&gt;what psychiatry terms psychosis, the hearing voices movement refers to as nonconsensus realities, and a bedrock faith of the movement is that filling a room with talk of phantasms will not infuse them with more vivid life or grant them more unshakable power.

just stick with psychosis. ""nonconsensus realities"" sounds like solipsism+, it's stupid. also what the fuck does, ""a bedrock faith of the movement is that filling a room with talk of phantasms will not infuse them with more vivid life or grant them more unshakable power"" even mean? christ, they need the put foot-notes for the rest of us.

&gt;instead, partly by lifting the pressure of secrecy and diminishing the feeling of deviance, the talk will loosen the hold of hallucinations and, crucially, the grip of isolation.

reasonable hypothesis, let's see how it pans out.

&gt;in the living room, a homemade banner declares: ‚Äúholding multiple truths. knowing that everyone has their own accurate view of the way things are.‚Äù

the latter statement is ""live, laugh, love"" levels of logic and self-contradicting. though, i'm sure the banner is meant as more of a shibboleth than to be literally believed, i hope.

&gt;the conventional mode emphasizes risk management, especially when it comes to psychosis; mainstream providers maintain that antipsychotic drugs, despite their downsides, can reduce the long-term odds of mental disintegration, suicide and ‚Äî however low the odds to begin with ‚Äî violent eruptions.

this is a good thing. unless these people have been able to determine when a schizophrenic is about to kill themselves or murder people. no? okay, then all ahead full with the conventional mode.

[this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4159061/) is a study from 8 years ago that outlines several other non-pharmaceutical treatments. 

&gt;yet the evidence that the medications improve outcomes is murky. and it is countered by other studies suggesting that maintenance on the drugs may actually worsen outcomes and even cause brain atrophy, though these findings have been debated. the area is devoid of conclusive science, a failure that is a prominent part of a wider problem in biomedical psychiatry: its lack of progress in treating serious conditions, or even precisely diagnosing and comprehending them.

classic, undermine the existing methods so you can present your method as the true solution. let's see what she has in store for us. [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6222385/) is a paper from 4 years ago that shows a mixed-bag for effectiveness that improves with each generation of pharmaceutical treatment. i agree that pharmacology isn't the entire answer, but i think this article is swinging too hard in the other direction - that being *no treatment* other than affirmation.

&gt;present methods can do damage and undermine outcomes not only through psychotropic side effects, and not only through the power imbalances of locked wards and court-ordered outpatient care and even seemingly benign practitioner-patient relationships, but also through a singular focus on reducing symptoms, a professional mind-set that leaves people feeling that they are seen as checklists of diagnostic criteria, not as human beings. ‚Äúthe widespread belief by many in the health sector that people with a mental-health condition have a brain defect or disorder of the brain,‚Äù funk added, ‚Äúso easily leads to overwhelming disempowerment, loss of identity, loss of hope, self-stigma and isolation.‚Äù

we are going to destroy ourselves with kindness.

&gt;the report features afiya house, along with the other work of the alliance, as well as the type of hearing voices groups that mazel-carlton is leading ‚Äî and seeding across the country. priorities common to the 22 are combating alienation, moving ‚Äúbeyond the biomedical model‚Äù that puts ‚Äúpsychotropic drugs at the center‚Äù and replacing ‚Äúthe language of diagnoses‚Äù with an emphatic embrace of ‚Äúhuman diversity.‚Äù

and mental health enters the culture war. what do they think is going to happen the first time a schizophrenic who was ""embraced"" and drug-free murders someone because a voice told them to?

&gt;in a sense, the w.h.o. and mazel-carlton are aligned with the neurodiversity movement that has begun to change society‚Äôs perceptions of autism.

all mental illness is the same mental illness, just ""quirks"" that definitely don't lead to anti-social or violent behaviour.

&gt;mazel-carlton takes care not to diminish the suffering of people like herself and speaks of expanding ‚Äúthe options for healing.‚Äù yet she sees her wish as analogous to not just the mainstreaming of autism but the nascent acceptance of new forms of gender identity. ‚Äúour society needs to expand its view of what it means to be human,‚Äù she says. ‚Äúto expand what is affirmed and honored.‚Äù

no it doesn't. this exact same rhetoric could be used to justify anything. if there is *nothing* that can be atypical, wrong, or harmful about a person's mind or body then *anything* can be folded into ""what it means to be human"".

&gt;‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt trying to free himself from the restraints, but one of the staff pulled me out of the room, saying that i didn‚Äôt understand the danger. most of them saw me as a crazy person with keys.‚Äù

hmmm.

&gt;the incident wasn‚Äôt unusual, but her voices surged, filling her car on her drive home. her oldest insisted, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre going to kill us.‚Äù she obeyed his order to barricade her bedroom door with a dresser. ‚Äúwe have to kill them,‚Äù he commanded.

-

&gt;she had no idea what to do.

nothing troubling here.

&gt;if she went into the alliance‚Äôs office to work, colleagues would figure out what was happening to her mind. if she didn‚Äôt go in, they would know just the same. she decided to ask her boss at the alliance whether she could stay at afiya, not as a staff member but as someone in terrible crisis.

*patient*, the word you're looking for is *patient*.

&gt;for mazel-carlton, one of the groups‚Äô most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality.

affirming the murder-voices will definitely not backfire on these people or society.

&gt;mazel-carlton modeled an h.v.n. principle that prizes curiosity about other realities by asking the man for more about his experience. in reply to another participant, she said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm so sorry that people are refusing to honor your soul‚Äôs identity.‚Äù then a woman talked about visiting her grandmother in a nursing home during covid and seeing her grandmother‚Äôs ‚Äúglowing pink orb rising from her chest‚Äù and everything as ‚Äúsparkling and glowing and timeless.‚Äù

okay, i gave it a good shot and got through about 2/3rds of the article. i'm packing it in here.

i'm replying to the (wrong) things you post, not proactively making a list of things that i think are wrong with the tax code.  margin loans are -- for the most part -- not a real loophole (basis step-up is a pretty bad one, but that doesn't seem to be what you're focusing on).

&gt; and acknowledge the fact that many times billionaires really do pay the lowest % of their **income** out of any bracket by exploiting loopholes

this isn't a fact, because (somehow, even after numerous replies back and forth) you don't understand what income actually is.  unrealized capital gains aren't income or even close to it.

mysteriously all of the breathless populist news articles about billionaires and paying a tiny amount of their 'true' income as taxes have disappeared over the past 6 months as those exact same calculations would show that people like bezos or musk or whoever have somehow generated an ""income"" of -$50b or more over that timeframe.  it's bad faith journalism aimed at credulous people like you and you've swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.

&gt; you can cite **singular times** when it made sense for billionaires to take the hit on capital gains tax

you have this backwards.  rich people with concentrated stock positions routinely sell stock and realize capital gains, and that is in fact the historical norm (which we've reverted to).  [bill gates has sold off 85% of his microsoft stock over the last 25 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/microsoft-s-gates-might-have-become-musk-plus-bezos-rich-chart), for example.  what is actually true is that they avoided doing it for a couple of years because generationally low interest rates made it favorable not to. 

&gt; you're simping for billionaires because you hope to be one someday but you know it's bullshit that they don't pay their fair share. a ""temporary embarrassed billionaire.""

this is some super weird projection on your part.  i make a bunch of money and pay a bunch of taxes -- pretty objectively more than my fair share and more proportionally than almost anyone in the country -- which i'm more or less fine with.  there is precisely zero chance that i'll ever become a billionaire.  i'm opposed to moronic populist reforms like taxing unrealized capital gains because they will affect me personally and because they would be tremendously destructive to the overall economy.

even if they could have somehow submitted the filing and kept it secret, that would also mean that they submitted the filing to do the split **before** the vote to allow them to increase the number of authorized shares was completed and also **before** they siled with the delaware sos to amend the charter.  so no, i think there is zero chance of a split happening on 6/9.  now they certainly could file the paperwork on 6/9 with the split to happen later this month.",7,,CatoMulligan,0

the lack of intrinsic value sets crypto's floor at 0.  if a crypto went to 0, no one would buy because its only perceived value is that other people want it, but if it goes to 0 then that means no one wants it, so it is not worth having.  this is why all crypto, even bitcoin, is destined to crash to 0.",8,,Tonyman121,0

the actual price is in dollars, or euros.  at the time of sale, a calculation is done and the amount of bitcoins needed is arrived upon.  you send the bitcoins in, which are sold to someone else, not the merchant, and the merchant receives dollars or euros.

so the bitcoins are not functioning as currency.  the price is in real currency, the merchant receives real currency, and you are simply selling your bitcoins and having the money sent on to newegg or whoever else it is.

1654536292,"no because what you said was fundamentally wrong.

it isnt double taxed.

lets say you make $10,000 in w-2 income after tax. you take that $10,000 and buy apple stock. you hold it for 2 years and sell it for $20,000. you have to pay taxes on the $10,000 of gain, but you get the original $10,000 of my basis back tax free. that is how tax basis in an asset works.

so you paid ordinary income rates on the $10k through your w-2, and then ltcg rates on the $10,000 of gain.

nowhere in there is there a double taxation for you personally.

please, and i mean please, dont give out tax advice or opinions. you simply do not know what you are talking about.",1,,No_Dream16,0
1654536296,"i kinda like this aspect of time travel. just ""oh shit, here i am"" and what do you do with the knowledge you have in your head.

without proper identification, you'd be homeless. sports, stock market, potentially collectibles (beanie babie/pokemon cards) are the only ways to cash in on your future knowledge. sports would be quicker, stock market and collectibles would take time. sports and stock market would require a straw man.

so i'd hang out at homeless shelters, try and get services despite not having id. volunteer at a church in my spare time and try and get in good with a kind soul. probably use my ability to spoil movies to prove i'm from the future or parlay on current events (like knowing the oj verdict). maybe not from the future but that i have a hunch that can be trusted.

i imagine you'd do well... like, you don't have the usual stigma of being homeless i.e. obvious mental illness, disability, addiction. so you'd be a good candidate for rehabilitation and services. just keep hush hush on the whole ""i'm from the future"" thing.

you have a bit of a catch-22, need funds to fake your identity so you can cash in on your knowledge of the future. but really no ability to get those funds.

even if you have a good encyclopedic knowledge of sports or followed a particular sports team. sports betting doesn't pay off particularly well. 10:1 odds you still need to front $100 to get $1,000. so for a scenario where it's worthwhile for everyone... you'd have to befriend a stranger, convince them to go to las vegas, put up $10,000 of their own money, and then be willing to split it with you? you'd only come out with $25,000 after taxes.

if you got married and went the microsoft stock route, divorce wise you'd get a share of the stock return. that's probably your most realistic/safest scenario. some homeless transient, start going to church, marry someone for convenience, then ride it out til the payday.

so the first year or two would be this really wild mad scramble to try and parlay your future knowledge, and get yourself established as legal so you can cash in. there's probably a really great story here, like drug dealing could make sense. you'd be a petty criminal. or a day laborer saving up everything you can til you remember definitively who wins the next super bowl, and convincing a friend to drive to las vegas and bet on it.

but the trajectory is microsoft stock until 2000, cash out and buy apple, then in 2010 cash that out and buy crypto. roughly 30 years you're a multi billionaire. at about 2000 you have a million, so you're ""okay"" but not great, at 2010 you've got about $10-$20 million so you're better than alright. basically you wouldn't have to work again.",2,,supergooduser,0

it has been a month since they bought the options and aapl‚Äôs price is still at around 143. if nancy had bought $150 options which constitutes wholly extrinsic value, she would be in the loss now as she‚Äôs losing a months of time value. assuming linear decay(not the case), if the option costed $70 and is 12 months out, the option will now lose 1/12 of the value. the option will now cost 63. she‚Äôll be -6$ in loss now.

because it's desirable. it holds or accrues value long term and cannot be seized and transactions have no boundaries and cannot be frozen. why would i want the dollar for itself? i wouldn't. except to buy something with it. no one would use it if it hadn't been decreed by the government.",1,,ebaley,0

my current job‚Äôs health benefits are still worse than my apple retail benefits though. barely. but still worse.

i would strongly recommend copy instead of move, then if you succeed in copying all the data, you can use remove-item to delete it.

try something like this:-

    $externaldrive=""z:\""
    cd \
    $v=gci -file -recurse -include ""*.docx"",""*.pdf"",""*.ppt""
    copy-item -whatif $v.fullname $externaldrive


set 'external drive' to the place where you want all the files moved.
note this pays no attention to duplicates, the last one copied will be the one that survives. 
this is why i urge you to test carefully, if the wrong file gets overwritten then it is lost.

if that lists the correct files, then remove the -whatif and run it again, then it will copy the items.
if that works, then change copy-item to remove-item to clean up after yourself.

1654624952,"i'm not cherry picking data at all..... what i'm showing is that the drastic fall from $160 was overblown, which is apparent if you take a look at how well $amd has done since they had their q1 2022 er. that er single handedly revealed to the market that all those analysts showing no confidence in amd were completely wrong and their fud articles had no bearing. taking a look at other stocks that had good earnings ($msft, $aapl etc) reveals that $amd's results actually mattered and that the drastic drop from $160 should have never happened. 

also, what more can you expect from a 2 beta stock? at their troughs, $qqq was down more than 30% from its peak, $spy down more than 20% from its peak, and $amd almost hit 50%. it should have been -60% since it's a 2 beta stock, right? seems it ""relatively"" overperformed. now it has rebounded much better than the rest of the market, due in part to the er they had early may. 

i'm not relying on investor day, idk where you got that idea from. i said investor day should help amd even more, which doesn't imply that i'm relying on it in the slightest.  i'm bullish on amd so obviously i hope that they have a good event later this week, but even if it's not good, i'm not going to be selling. also, i don't have any short term long positions on $amd. my entire $amd position is long shares, long itm leaps calls that expire in 2023 / 2024, and a few short puts the expire roughly 45 days from now (theta strategies).  

you need to chill out man, you're crazy. i never said that $amd will not see $100 again or go below it. all i'm saying is that $amd has done significantly better than the rest of the market since the recent bottom of the market was found. i have no clue if that was the bottom, but what i can see is that $spy is up +8.42% from the recent bottom, $qqq is up +10% from the recent bottom and $amd is up +26.64% from the recent bottom. if that doesn't prove to you that maybe,  just maybe amd's earnings had something to do with that significant over performance, then i don't know what will prove it to you!",1,,yallneedjesuslol,0

1654638620,"i'm about to mod a hrap v myself and just opened up the one im going to work on.

1. can i use the rap v stock screws to mount the sanwa jlf instead of the built in hayabusa or will i have to order some with the stick (they're not included it seems). what size of screws will i need later anyway for my custom built (length will depend on top material, i guess)?

(yes. you can use the rap v stock screws.)

2. i've seen people rave about the otto kit, but since it doesn't seem to be available ineurope, is it so much worth it? i will be able to order springs, gates, plungers and shaftsto customize within eu, so it's mostly interesting for the pivot system, probably.

(before you go crazy buying all that stuff, get used to the stock jlf at first. you just might be okay with that.)

3. i want to try a couple of bat and ball tops to see what plays better with my style. ialready found out that mesh designs seem to be just as slick as usual plastic, not havinga grip from the design. but there's aluminium, hollow aluminum and also rubber andwood. do these have any specific advantage or disadvantage?

(really, just a matter of preference)

4. i would have installed regular sanwa buttons, but now people talking 202's haveconfused me. are they really better? since i can only order them in clear or metallic forabout 6/7‚Ç¨ a piece it seems at the shop i was going to buy from, it would be a muchlarger investment than sanwas, so trying both might push me out of budget right now.they're also screw ins, which i'd prefer to transfer to my later custom case, but i've readthey don't fit all systems. can i put them into the rap v?

(action buttons are traditionally 30mm. start/psn/select etc... are traditionally 24mm. ive owned sanwa's and crown 202s and my preference is the sensitivity and the loudness of the buttons. sanwa's imo are generally really loud. crown 202's, which are my preferred switches, are slightly quieter but have a drastically shorter throw distance/sensitivity in order for the input to react. i often put in inputs just from lightly brushing across them by accident. really tho, its a matter of preference. screw ins tend to loosen up after play if they arent wrenched on. some snap-ins tend to break. not all, but some do. matter of preference. another thing is that a lot of cases tend to differ in thickness or some have these weird rivets, those are things that you need to worry about when choosing switches.)

5. i've seen a holographic effect dust washer for seimitsu, do they use any different sizesthan for sanwa or could i use one? i think the shaft covers aren't the same, are they?

(no idea but if i were to guess, theyre the same size. only time it will change is usually when you install something that makes the lever detachable.)

6. as i'm going to try a long shaft as well on the sanwa jlf, this is going to mean no shaftcover then, doesn't it? i've seen coloured aluminum shafts i considered, would thathave any technical effect other than the stock material or can i just use it like thesanwa part?

(no clue)

7. if i'm not going to mess around with the pivot, will it be useful to have some greasehandy for later maintenance or is that going to last until the end?

(yes)

8. are there any other parts that are good to have in stock when modding? i will orderone or two e clips just in case one gets lost, for instance.

(usually hit or miss. ive messed up my 20 pin and had to replace that one time because of replacing buttons so much. )

1654684902,"you have a lot of safe plays in there but i actually like other options in regards to a portfolio where you want to supplement income. 

if you want higher dividends then in the sectors look at the following. 

tech - $avgo or $csco. higher dividend stocks with growth. not growth like apple or msft but still growth. 

health - $abbv or $$pfe. amazing returns the last few years and much higher dividends than jnj

telecom - there is really no great ones but $lumn is 8% and $t is 5%. i would actually rotate from telcom into an energy stock like $dvn or $xom right now. 

industrials - 3m is a steady dividend payer but a company like $dow or $ups has given growth with a competitive dividend. 3m has not offered much in terms of growth the last five years. 

cs - $ko is nice and steady but probably one of the best in this sector is $mo. high dividend and good growth, if you can handle owning a tobacco company this is a better ply than $ko for now and you can rotate to $ko if it takes a down turn. 

etf - $schd is the go to and $jepi is a high dividend payer. 

others to consider for income are bdcs like $gain, $glad, $pflt, $psec or the reits like $o or $good. all six of those are monthly dividends that pay at higher yields if you want income. 

but at 21 if you are looking for long term growth with a steady drip and minimal downside, that will turn into a nice supplemental income when you are older i like what you have except for 3m. i really want to add 3m to my portfolio but there is a lot of better companies right now in that sector with better dividends and growth.",18,,[deleted],0

[democracy allows you to choose your leaders, which granted people aren't always the best at and it has tons of flaws, but it's about the best we've got currently  however, most people spend most of their time at work typically for a privately owned company who's decisions are made by shareholders and ceos. this means that, despite ostensibly living in a democracy, when it comes to earning a living, you're essentially participating in a sort of authoritarian monarchy where the person who can afford the most shares can make the decisions without question  it's clear that companies heavily prioritize their own profit over everything else, including the quality of life of their workers, the environment, our collective future ability to exist as a species on this planet, etc.  we should be most focused on democratizing workplaces. workers should have direct control over what their company does, who they pay what, and how they allocate profits. the people whose lives are at stake have the most incentive to make the company flourish, rather than some scumbag ceo who can buyback all the shares and give himself a $60m golden parachute before burning the entire company to the ground.  unfortunately that's unlikely, so we'll continue to see morons sucking jeff bezos and elon musk thinking magic greedy money daddies are gonna use their giant tunnel grift or space cocks to save us all from miserable serfdom with their 1000iq innovation while the government is intentionally farmed of any talent or iq and buying off regulators is just seen as a cost of doing business](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v6hr7e/what_will_happen_with_our_economy/ibhfmuw/)

1654712271,"i'm currently not for or against a dividend, but i'd like to hear why you think a dividend will make $amd no longer go up. in a lower comment, you say no to even a penny dividend, you want absolutely nothing, not even a single piece of paper as a dividend. why is that?

$aapl has over 0.5% dividend and they have gone up nearly 300% in the past 5 years, so that quashes your argument that a dividend makes a stock not perform well. $amd is growing at more than double the pace of $aapl and $amd is up around 700% in the past 5 years, which is more than double $aapl performance and $aapl has a nice dividend. with that information, why would something like a 0.01% dividend, just to get dividend investors to invest, be a bad thing? a 0.01% dividend is still 60x lower than $aapl's dividend, and $amd is growing 2x as fast, so i truly don't see how this would hurt $amd.",1,,yallneedjesuslol,0

i'd love to get a source about that oath they swear about being subservient to men. you sound like you have extremely strong and unfounded opinions about that group.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; this is the first i‚Äôm hearing about 49 million people dying due to the recognition nationwide of a woman‚Äôs right to make decisions about her own healthcare.

...i never said 49 million have died as a result. i said millions of people have died over the last 49 years as a result. around 600,000 to 800,000 abortions are performed annually in the us, so making a bad estimate over the last 49 years is roughly 34 million abortions. abortions result in a death.

arizona keeps good data concerning abortions. [page 24.](https://azdhs.gov/documents/preparedness/public-health-statistics/abortions/2012-arizona-abortion-report.pdf)

&gt; the majority of abortions were elective (99.02%), with 1290.98%) cases reported as taking place for medical reasons.

if we extrapolate that to the roughly 700,000 abortions that annually occur nation-wide, that's about 7,000 abortions performed annually for medical reasons. further, i have yet to see a state banning abortions when the life of the mother is in danger.

&gt; childbirth is fourteen times more deadly than abortion.

childbirth is incredibly safe.

there were about [3,600,000 live births](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm) in the us in 2020, roughly [800,000 abortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_statistics_in_the_united_states), and roughly [875,000 miscarriages](https://www.livescience.com/50790-miscarriage-misconceptions.html), for an estimated total of 5,275,000 pregnancies. there were [861 maternal deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm) that same year.

this yields an overall pregnancy death rate of 0.016%. if every maternal death occurred during birth (they didn't), the maternal death rate due to childbirth would be 0.024%. [the death rate for symptomatic flu is around 0.11-0.12% typically](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html), or about 5 times higher.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the ‚Äú49 million deaths‚Äù you‚Äôre referring to weren‚Äôt actual people that ever existed, were they?

again, i never mentioned 49 million people, but zygotes on up through infants are, indeed, people. zygotes are organisms, and organisms that are members of homo sapiens are called human beings. human being are also called people, and denying ""personhood"" to certain humans because their deaths would be convenient is wildly shitty, but pushed by some people nevertheless.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; a date of birth, a gender, a date of death, their age at the time of their death, and a cause of death - because that‚Äôs what we do in this country when people die.

this is another great joke. i'm fully aware that you don't actually believe that a person cannot exist without documentation. no paperwork, no person? well played.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; so that 49 million number represents nothing more than medical procedures performed, not ‚Äúdeaths‚Äù of people.

*sigh*, you need to read correctly. also, just because your beliefs are incongruent with the fact that zygotes are people doesn't mean that your resulting word vomit is meaningful, especially compared to the facts as stated by embryologists and other doctors who write embryology textbooks.

1654765259,"seeing the data and trying it can give additional perspective to see it in action. i've admittedly done this over the years, just like anyone else. and yes, of course, arraylists are going to deprecated but, for the sake of current examples, it's still worth seeing.

`$array += ""strawberry""`

or

    foreach($v in $var) { 
        $array += $v
    }

this works, yes. i'm all for the idea of make it work, then make it better. and when you only need to do a few objects, this isn't a huge issue. but we want to use and develop scalable code. the reason this becomes a problem is the way that `+=` functions.

    #numbers 1 through 10000
    foreach($number in 1..10000) { 
        $array += $number 
    }

your output will be exactly what you expected -- the numbers 1-10,000. but what happens when we do this with the number 100,000? 1,000,000?  we can test those values with measure-command to see how long execution times take.

    measure-command -expression {
    $array = @()
    
    #numbers 1 through 10,000
    foreach($number in 1..10000) { 
            $array += $number 
        }
    }

this command for me was approx 2.7 seconds. doesn't seem bad right? so if we multiply the same process by 10 and run it against 100,000 we might expect the execution times to stay the same on average, right? guessing 27-30 seconds?

    measure-command -expression {
    $array = @()
    
    #numbers 1 through 100,000
    foreach($number in 1..100000) {
            $array += $number    
        }
    }

the complete execution time for me was approx. 6 minutes and 40 seconds. but why?! of course these numbers will fluctuate depending on available computer resources, so feel free to test for yourself. this shows an inherent flaw with `+=`. to understand why, we need to understand how `+=` works. each time `+=` is executed, it makes a complete copy of the specified array, then it adds the next item/number, then overwrites the previous array. it continues to do that for every single cycle. so when you run it against 100,000 there are 100,000 copies being made and a single item being added‚Ä¶ each‚Ä¶ time‚Ä¶ now, let's take a look at using dynamic arrays and filling them.

    $dynamicarray = new-object system.collections.arraylist
    foreach($number in 1..100000) { 
        $dynamicarray.add($number) 
    }

you can wrap this loop into the measure-command -expression syntax as previously shown and see how long this takes to build an array to 100,000.

my execution time to build that array was‚Ä¶ 0.15 seconds or 151 milliseconds. compared to 6 minutes and 40 seconds the other way. that is also 18 times faster than the previous method to build an array to 10,000 (remember this one was to 100,000).that's an insane difference. but wait there is more, we can actually make this even faster by skipping the foreach loop to build that dynamic array.

    $dynamicarray = new-object system.collections.arraylist
    $dynamicarray.addrange(1..100000)

with an execution time of‚Ä¶. .01 seconds or 11 milliseconds. also, changing the value to 100,000,000 only takes 14.6 seconds. you're welcome.

usually, real world examples are more than just a list of integers but, you can see where this is going and how easily things get out of hand. and really you could just set your variables directly to the range of numbers, too. the objects will just be slightly different.",1,,JBear_Alpha,0

[the market has been cruel in the past 1‚Äì2 years. but i can't tell you how many times i have seen or heard people say they sell after a stock drops 10%. ridiculous. people need to read peter lynch. bag holding can be okay. if you're holding good companies.  generally asking ""should i hold onto my losers"" means nothing. some people are down like -25% on googl and -40% on tgt rn. people here would have you believe you need to sell, take a loss, and get into indexes. sure you can do that. is the market right as to why your stock is down? if its p/s is 30 and it has no earnings, then probably. but if it's way undervalued now, you must decide if you have the conviction to buy more. this is the game you're playing now. you have to buy when the stock is down, as long as the company is continuing to do well overall. it will never feel like the right time when it's down, but that's how real money is often made.  lastly, the advice that unrealized losses are real losses is not valuable unless you're an active trader. for example, if i buy a nice winter jacket for $200, and then 6 months later, go out to a beach in the peak of summer and try to sell the jacket to beachgoers, it's highly unlikely anyone will pay me full price. in that environment, somebody may only be willing to pay up to $80. but conditions change all the time, it just takes a while. advice from day-to-day traders will be detrimental if your plan is to hold 10 years, because they'll be telling you to sell every summer! (metaphorically) likewise, if you are planning to hold 10 years but the stock's fundamentals are terrible, perhaps trading to a healthier company in a similar industry or an etf is most logical. it's up to you and only you to dyor.](/r/stocks/comments/v7lq54/strategies_to_get_rid_of_poor_positions/iblss0g/)

there‚Äôs kind of two types of corporations. those that are executive-driven, and those that are talent-driven. if you‚Äôre an apple stock holder, and jony ive says we need to spend money on wireless earbuds, you follow his lead because he is who made the decisions that have already brought success. 

that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs kind of good when you see consumers aware and heralding the talent , for example, hideo kojima. because of his recognition and name, executives aren‚Äôt just going to override his decisions. 

when these ea-type companies have just armies of nameless and faceless college-grads, they start to just champion their marketing people and sales execs, and that‚Äôs when they usually make bad decisions. 

movies and television operate very similarly (all of this is about studio-based business models) and some of them give all the money and decisions to the big-name director they hired, while others hire a no-name director and tel them exactly what to do. reality tv is an example of broadcast executives making creative decisions and just telling everyone what to do, compared to a show like ‚Äòbreaking bad‚Äô where fx just pays money to frank gillian to go do what he wants and bring back a masterpiece.",3,,marcocom,0

i'm financially independent, and $amzn, $goog, and $aapl have played a big role in that, even if they have shit the bed of late (fml). yes, i'm down over $800k since december, but i lost 40% in 2008-9 and got it all back and more because i'm *diversified* and i buy in every month whether the market is up or down (dca ftw).

i don't hate gme, btw. i hate the conspiracy theories (moass) and the incessant shilling. i believe gme will run this summer if the split happens, but my risk profile doesn't include options or meme stocks anymore, so i view it as a side show.

i'm not trying to convince you one way or another (i don't own microsoft stock) but i play on xbox series x at 1440p 120 fps (destiny 2 pvp, pve is always limited to 60 fps) using an hdmi 2.0 monitor (you only need hdmi 2.1 for 120 fps if you're at 4k, but 1440p and lower can push 120 fps over hdmi 2.0).  

the series s cannot do 120 fps, series x can (for pvp only but that's where i want it).

the jump from 30 fps to 60 fps is more meaningful than the jump from 60 to 120, so either option will feel like a big upgrade but... 120 fps is very smooth for console gaming.

if you turn on the 120 fps pvp option on the series x destiny 2 renders pvp frames internally at about 1440p anyway, not 4k (the 4k output is a supersampled output of the lower resolution framebuffer, not native 4k), so 1440p/120fps is, imo, actually the sweet spot.",7,,georgemcbay,0

1654905886,"**hololens creator‚Äôs departure won‚Äôt derail microsoft‚Äôs metaverse ambitions**  
**msft stock was flat on news hololens creator is leaving microsoft after accusations of misconduct.**

[https://investorplace.com/2022/06/hololens-creators-departure-wont-derail-microsofts-metaverse-ambitions/](https://investorplace.com/2022/06/hololens-creators-departure-wont-derail-microsofts-metaverse-ambitions/)

on jun. 8, microsoft corporation (msft) confirmed hololens creator alex kipman is leaving the company after being accused of inappropriate behavior.  
this is a critical time, with the hololens ar headset the subject of a $22 billion army deal and a potential metaverse anchor.

**microsoft corporation (nasdaq:msft) had a head start on the metaverse, the next big thing that could prove to be a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in less than a decade**. the company revealed its hololens ar headset back in 2016. in 2019, the company launched a second generation hololens 2, aimed at the commercial market. in 2021, microsoft landed a nearly-$22 billion contract to supply hololens 2 headsets to the u.s. army. however, msft has stayed fairly flat on both pieces of news.  
  
**as you might expect, a deal of that size was a win for msft stock. even more so because it involved futuristic technology instead of a bunch of office or windows subscriptions. this showed the future of microsoft and confirmed the company as a big player in the metaverse ‚Äî even if the metaverse term hadn‚Äôt really entered business vocabulary at that point**.  
  
that makes wednesday‚Äôs news disconcerting. alex kipman, a 20-plus year microsoft employee and creator of the hololens, is leaving the company. kipman has been accused of inappropriate behavior, including misconduct against female employees. according to cnbc, microsoft has indicated it will reorganize the mixed reality team and is weighing whether to continue hololens development.  
  
for some investors, this may be a concerning moment, an apparent obstacle in microsoft‚Äôs metaverse ambitions. it may be embarrassing, but it is not the problem some think it is. with msft stock down almost 19% in 2022, this is a good time to buy it on the cheap. growth will return and keep going, with the metaverse playing a big role, despite the current hololens creator drama.

**hololens will keep on rolling if microsoft wants it to**

  
alex kipman may be the creator of the hololens, but his departure does not mean it grinds to a halt. this is a team that was estimated at 1,500 people earlier this year. the engineering talent is there to keep product development rolling. if microsoft even wants to, that is.  
  
the company previously cancelled the third generation hololens. the army contract is reportedly in trouble. at this point, microsoft may decide it‚Äôs better to leave ar headsets ‚Äî and the cost of developing them ‚Äî to third party vendors.   
  
microsoft has bigger metaverse ambitions than hololens

so the first scenario assumes a 100% gain in the stock price.

but (no split $100) ‚Üí (no split $150) is only a 50% gain in the stock price.

when comparing stock price increases/decreases, you have to think in terms of percentage changes, not the absolute dollar change per share.

1654964983,"everyone holds some amount of cash at any given moment generally. like lets just come up with a random figure and say most people you know always have at least 100$. or at least 1000$. or at least 10,000$. lets just say. well those people should store their money in bitcoin at any given moment between when they obtain the money and when they spend it, simply to avoid having their money be printed away. inflation is sort of like musical chairs. when the music stops playing, you want to have a seat, otherwise you'll get screwed. cash is sort of like a hot potato, whoever happens to be holding it at the moment when inflation happens, they deal with the damage. the reason they hold cash instead of a stock is cause they don't want to hold any particular stock with this money, they want it to be sort of neutral. thats what i think. and/or blabla stocks are too risky or they don't want to learn about it whatever. they should have another option though i agree with them, and i think that option is bitcoin. and even if bitcoin didnt go up in value, if it simply held its value, that would be a good tool to have access to. a way to pause your money and be isolated from inflation. now the other part is of course, there is a period between now and when bitcoin actually becomes that steady tool to protect you from inflation. and in my view this time is an opportunity to buy some before it goes up significantly and eventually slows down growing, at some point where it may exist at a more ""flat"" value. this vision of a flat bitcoin, this is what people *want* cash to be, and what financially illiterate people *think* cash is. 

&amp;#x200b;

so back to that. that question is basically saying they always want to spend all of their money. they could store their money in apple stock theyd still have the same question wouldn't they? ""its just numbers on a screen?"" thats more of a lifestyle choice to be someone who wants to spend all their money. yes theres no point blabla you can't take it with you yada yada, but that doesn't mean you have to spend all your money frivolously on overpriced stuff from fancy places and expensive conveniences but then you have to work way harder to live your life. thats something you can't take with you in my view, instead people should want to store their resources efficiently and use their resources efficiently, when you want to spend it you'll be able to spend more. sure you can't take it with you, but better to go out with a bang right? or in my case, i see it as a way to store my hard work and i never know when i might need it. also the more money you have in an investment, the bigger the rewards can be. i still intend to use money to do things i desire in life. sort of like warren buffet, i want to be rich, but i don't need to spend all my money every day to feel that satisfaction that its not just ""numbers on a screen"".

&amp;#x200b;

getting passed the ""its just numbers on a screen"" view is vital to experience the benefits of any investment, even stocks. maybe he's saying well if he has a house its not numbers on a screen, he can live in it. well what if you have a bar of gold? is that acceptable? maybe maybe not. i think if he sees the value of gold then he basically understands the value of bitcoin even if he isn't able to accept it. to me the difference between gold and bitcoin seems to be mostly superficial.

&amp;#x200b;

also im not fundamentally against inflation, and i sort of see the appeal of inflation. but i also see another side like that maybe things should work the way people expect them to work to some degree. like if society collectively believes we should preserve the grand canyon, then that is what should be done. or if society collectively believes we should have hospitals, then they should be created. when it comes to money, i think society collectively does believe they want to create a system of money. they want to be able to store their time and resources in a way that it doesn't erode over time, if thats possible. and i think cash exists in all societies because in all societies there is a yearning for this value storage technology. but i don't think many people actually want the inflation. and i think its like democracy itself its the will of the people. and wherever the vote goes, we honor that. no matter who they elect, or what they want to do, there is no one who's opinion matters more than the population who would be most effected by the results of the decision, and so they will make the decision. even if they make a dumb decision, it should still be honored. in a scenario where you believe the decision is dumb, then you can only try to educate society more and be a voice of reason. debate other people, and hopefully if you're right and you see something others didnt realize, it shines through and it catches on. if something truly is better for people, you should be able to explain it to them in a way that they understand. and if it can't be explained, theres a significant risk that no one or very few people understand the real full implications of what's going on, and in that environment we can get a subpar experience and get the short end of the stick. 

&amp;#x200b;

everything is just numbers on a screen. this is like the type of thought you have on day one when you first begin contemplating saving for your future. its just numbers. is my life just numbers? lets spend all our money? what does he want as a response? ""yes life is futile, nothing matters, its ok to give up"" thats not like a bitcoin question thats just like a life philosophy that precludes any investment whatsoever. doesn't it?",1,,98gffg7728993d87,0

(more to this than the one line i wrote)  3: buy a set of options you believe can go 10x in your favor based on your research.  4: i buy a minimum of 3 contracts at a time. if those contracts rise 33% in my favor i close out 2 and let the other one run til expiry in most circumstances. as my account has grown, ive taken on larger lots and i take profits sooner until i have 3 contracts or so that were all essentially free or heavily subsidized.   my last few plays were nvda puts the when it was above $150 a while back. wmt puts a couple weeks ago for earnings, and target calls which lost like 99% of their value. i often see my contracts fall by half their value before they go up. the trick is to bet so little that you don‚Äôt care if it goes to 0.  my best falling knife was $100 one 0 dte spy puts back in january that went 100 to one, but i had spent like $800 buying spy puts prior to that.    the other thing i like doing is wide straddles. i would have straddled at open thursday if i had had the time to look into it‚Ä¶. i think.     i‚Äôve been doing this since about november.](/r/daytrading/comments/v9vcw1/correct_me_if_i_am_wrong_but_do_i_see_a_reversal/ibzqomh/)

[&gt;they are set to grow in a few years  well before that they are expected to see declining earnings (almost 1/3 lower than in 2021) with barely any rev growth at all. previous management didn't exactly instill trust and people would rather see the new management actually turn things around than speculate on them doing so. catching up to nvda and amd probably isn't gonna be easy either, since they and their reputation really pulled away from intel in recent years. at this point the balance of risk and reward still isn't too enticing for most. as for me, i may nibble if it hits 35, if it gets there although i would prefer to get in at a lower valuation if i were to get in at this stage.  seeing how both earnings and fcf are expected to decline, intc staying at the current valuation would signify an expansion of several valuation metrics to levels higher than they were for most of the past 10 years, so one could argue that a good chance of turning things around and getting to a point of better growth would already be priced in at that point. likewise, that means there should be a very good chance for this stock to go lower.](/r/stocks/comments/vab2kv/spy_is_still_21_above_prepandemic_highs/ic29hml/)

[i'm one of the folks who don't advocate for blind dca. i haven't sold anything other than a tech fund this year (reason for selling was due to what i felt was excessively large holdings in nvda and tsla, not so much it's performance) but i haven't added to my index funds either.  as the inflation numbers don't show things getting under control, i have to admit i'm also very tempted to sell and re-assess in late august/early september.  i can't say for certain obviously but i do believe the s&amp;p will dip further... the last week was pretty rough. when the next gdp numbers come out, i suspect they'll show we're in a recession. in which case, we can expect an even bigger sell off.  the question for me is, do i foresee much of a catalyst to cause stocks to rise before early september and barring putin dying, i can't say i do..  and so i'm here rambling and wondering whether i should sell now or just hold. i'll decide before monday morning. would be good to hear what decision other folks have made by then](/r/stocks/comments/va3hxd/will_voosp500_dip_further_down/ic03jl0/)

1655085499,right.  it's a scapegoat. apple stock alone is down like 700 billion this year.,42,,Sapere_aude75,0
1655093046,"ev's are precisely where you want to be right now.  what happens when something new comes along that is just so much better that it changes the world.  

if you're in your 30's it's happened a few times in your lifetime.   let's review.

1. pc invented - start of microsoft and apple
2. internet invented - start of amazon ecommerce, ect
3. smartphones invented - catapulted apple to most valuable company ever.  

all of these things were essentially created and developed in the us and all of these things made early investors filthy fucking rich and cemented the us position as the undisputed king of innovation.  notice how these things all link together one after another essentially since the invention of the semiconductor? 

now we've got another \*very\* similar looking trend emerging.  it's electric and autonomous vehicles and essentially turning your car into a smartphone.  some people cringe but how fucking convenient is it to just have a big screen with essentially google maps on it showing you where to go.    and a spotify app to play music from.  

it's the next logical chain in the link.  and looking back at the 3 previous steps you don't even have to be \*that\* early.  if you bought microsoft stock in 1996 computers were already out.  windows 95 was out.  it was working.  it's not like oh this is some startup that might or might not work out.  like if you had kids they were probably using windows 95 in the computer lab.  

then they just incrementally improved the shit out out of it.

the internet was the same kinda way.  remember dial up modems?  yea how did you do if you bought amzn when dial up was a thing?  it was working.  you could go on there and buy shit cheaper than the stores.  

and a final recap.  how did you do if you bought aapl when they released their first iphone?  you could hold it in your hands and see how cool and useful it was.  

&amp;#x200b;

so right now you can go online and buy a model 3 for $49k and it will show up to you later this year.  that compares with an average new vehicle price of $47k.  

you have 4 immediate benefits.  

1. depending on where you live, you're going to save about 50-80% of your fuel bill and nearly 100% of your maintenance bill.   in practical terms this means, the more you spend on fuel now, the more you benefit.   for people who drive \*alot\* paying $700 a month for an ev might actually save them $500 in gas, making a net payment of only $200.  this is huge for people with long commutes
2. autopilot ""advanced cruise control"".  if you haven't experienced doing a long day of driving on autopilot vs traditional driving rent one and try it.  
3. the car is actually quite good.  performance is significantly better than you would receive in a similarly priced gas car, even a luxury import.  there are new cool features that are very convenient if you haven't had them before, like a screen with navigation/live traffic routing instead of having to pull it up on your phone.   other features like being able to watch netflix when parked or stream spotify instead of listening to ads or subscribing to satellite radio are huge too.  things like being able to keep the car and climate on while parked for pets, and being able to pre cool/heat your car from the app sure come in handy too.
4. oh and like it's \*way\* better for the environment.  the data is out.  it's a smoking-causes-cancer thing all over again with the oil industry taking the place of big tobacco.  same tactics, fake studies, rumors, about things like how bad it is to produce battery packs, or how the grid isn't ready for everyone charging, or how so much energy is made from coal it's just as dirty to drive an ev.   essentially with the market based (it's cheaper) transition into renewable power sources that is currently underway ev's are essentially going to end up an order of magnitude better for the environment (10x) not to mention the geopolitical situation with opec rn :(.

of course there's a few other things people worry about like charging (especially if you don't have a garage), range anxiety, ect.  those issues are being addressed in meaningful ways.  dc fast charging speeds have been increasing significantly and newer battery chemistries and bms are able to accept higher charge rates safely.  we're seeing that type of windows 95 to 98 incremental improvements.  the same stuff we see with smartphones.  

it's pretty clear we're right on the cusp here of something big.  ford \*just\* delivered it's first f150 lightning two weeks ago.  and ford has the supply chain experience and scale to be able to ramp significantly.  look at all the announcements from ford and gm about how many ev's they will produce.  they have been accelerating their ramp and announcing it as they do it.  

essentially we're entering a new era.  the automakers that don't adept will die.  the writing is on the wall so to speak.  this is the next evolution of vehicles.  it's not hard to see if you know where to look.  

the implications and stakes are absolutely massive since transportion is such a major industry.  everything from geopolitics in russia and saudi arabia to the value of a busy intersection commercial lot in anywhere usa are going to be upended.  

anyway i could rant for awhile but the ev space is definitely not one to ignore but there is a ton of hype and you must pick companies very carefully.",18,,AbbaFuckingZabba,1

1655103787,"you are right. but even the future needs to be bought at the right price.

microsoft stock went nowhere between 2000-2010, amazon stock fell more than 90% in the dot com bust, and then you have stocks that never recovered like intel, cisco etc.

yes if you had just held amazon etc. you would have done well but would you really have held in a 90% drawdown? statistics say no. just looking at the number of redditors trying to time the market tells me no.

valuation is always important. and in that regard i have no idea what tesla (for example) should be valued at as i don‚Äôt know what reasonable assumptions for growth are. same with most ev stocks.",2,,Substantial-Lawyer91,0
1655108015,"again, exactly like the stock market. tesla stock @ $65 q4 2019, $1000 6 months later. that's a 15x gain. you really think tesla will ever get below $100 again?? if you would have bought $10k of apple stock in summer 2016 @ $25 and held to its top at $170 in january 2022 you would have had almost 7x gain. 

all of this, crypto *and* stocks, are easily reproducible.",1,,TP_Crisis_2020,0
1655111467,"simply knowing all the big economic trends of the last 30 years ahead of time can make anyone a billionaire, all he has to do is memorise some of the big stock bubbles and crashes. microsoft stock was $0.63 in 1990 and $343 before the current crash, so you don't need to found microsoft, you just need some stock in them at the right time.

if i was in that situation i would get any job i could and invest every spare dollar into companies like this that i know will be successful later on, and i will have all the money in the world. the real problem would be all the attention (from governments and otherwise) this would attract because it would look like insider trading.",9,,King_In_Jello,0

1655127079,"i have been predicting this for a year.  cryptos are like the dutch tulip craze, without real flowers, or digital chain letters like i lost $5 on as a little kid in 1965.  great if you are the first one in and sell at the top, but since cryptos have never had any intrinsic value and create nothing in the real world (unless you convert them to real money or swap them for a real condo or something)  they were doomed to collapse. 

sorry bitcoin bros, but even $23,000 is a bubble, and when you saw the vinklevoss twins downsizing and closing offices last week you should have joined them.  so now you have a 24 hour unregulated market with no circuit breakers, no fed bailout, no hope of rescue and likely the manor crypto exchanges will all collapse today like terra did.   

i have been saying all year, 99% of cryptos will go to zero and the few survivors like btc will find a bottom somewhere in the $10,000 area and then become a much smaller bitcoin brah diehard bartering and money laundering tool as some people will refuse to give up and keep bitcoin  on life support.  this like also signals the end for el salvador's president, for all the big crypto advertisers, lobbyists, political contributors, and will likely be the end of nft's and most of the fintech pilot programs.   

my advice is get out now and buy something solid at a big discount like aapl stock. even if you lost 50% or more on cryptos, you can still backstop your losses now with aapl which, once the stormclouds pass will be as solid as a rock again and probably go up 50% over the next year or two.  or just go to cash, then good old us dollar is doing fine and inflation is strictly putin these days.  if putin falls or some peace deal is made, oil will plummet by 25%, which is also why it's risky to buy oil stocks now even though right now they are doing great.",1,,Immediate-Assist-598,0

[i'm one of the folks who don't advocate for blind dca. i haven't sold anything other than a tech fund this year (reason for selling was due to what i felt was excessively large holdings in nvda and tsla, not so much it's performance) but i haven't added to my index funds either.  as the inflation numbers don't show things getting under control, i have to admit i'm also very tempted to sell and re-assess in late august/early september.  i can't say for certain obviously but i do believe the s&amp;p will dip further... the last week was pretty rough. when the next gdp numbers come out, i suspect they'll show we're in a recession. in which case, we can expect an even bigger sell off.  the question for me is, do i foresee much of a catalyst to cause stocks to rise before early september and barring putin dying, i can't say i do..  and so i'm here rambling and wondering whether i should sell now or just hold. i'll decide before monday morning. would be good to hear what decision other folks have made by then](/r/stocks/comments/va3hxd/will_voosp500_dip_further_down/ic03jl0/)

[no matter how great a company is, fundamentals matter and valuation matters. paying an obscene valuation and basically banking on the company staying as ridiculously overvalued as it performs is a dangerous game, one that way too many people are playing. you know, you don't see fb, goog, aapl, msft trading at pes of 50, 60, 80, 100, even though they are brilliant companies.  as a company performs, it eventually matures. naturally the p/e and other valuation metrics will come down and reflect that. paying a p/e of 100 is basically saying ""yeah, i expect this company to grow 30, 35, 40%, and not just for one year but for years and years and years to come. tell me, how realistic is that for nvda? what were your expectations when buying it at a market cap of 700 or 800 billion dollar? that this was gonna be a 2t company in 5 years?  and, again, value moderation. let's say nvda starts slowing down and people expect them to grow 15 to 20% annually (which is still stellar growth for a company this size of course). eventually that will factor into the p/e and the people might only be willing to pay a 30 p/e (note that this is obviously very superficial since i'm only using p/e to illustrate). with the expected earnings for nvda, that would amount to a share price of roughly 195 to 225 bucks in 2025/2026.  if nothing else, i think that show to some extent that valuation matters even for brilliant companies that are here to stay and grow. even at the absolute high end for analyst estimates that sort of p/e moderation, which would, in my opinion, be fair, the share price would be expected to be around around 260 to 270 in 2025/2026. so that would still amount to a -10% in 4-5 years if you bought at 300 and held on. not a great performance, even though the company would be performing very well in that time.](/r/stocks/comments/v9emm3/nvda_stock_what_does_everyone_think/ibydypl/)

[and like a bunch of other stocks. all the major cloud services. tons of other companies that are growing and increasing their profits.  one thing that people forget in the 1970s and 1980s was that running companies was much harder. things weren't so automated. new business wasn't moving around so much due to a much more constraining lack of liquidity.  this is not gonna be like the deflationary panic of 1893-1897. it's not gonna be like the 1970s. it's not at all like the dotcom bubble where tons of shitty completely useless websites were being invested in (which amzn survived btw).  the only thing people can really talk about is that layer of fat. the layer of fat of investors that are investing emotionally or perceptions of data that aren't real or options trading in a gambling way. that will contribute to a sort of up and down rollercoaster in the market for a little while before they settle down. the data is there and many of these companies are producing their best profits still.](/r/stocks/comments/vab2kv/spy_is_still_21_above_prepandemic_highs/ic1s8y2/)

1655137497,"it's a fun healthy thought experiment for me. 

going back in the past, with the benefit of hindsight you could relive life on 'easy' mode. you'd just be that guy who bought apple stock before the ipod was announced, or in 2008 were like ""hey, i'll buy a thousand bitcoins for $500 what's the worst that could happen?"" and boom, you're now independently wealthy.

or look at what the smartphone industry was like in 2007, you had smart phones with windows mobile, nokia, palm, blackberry and then the upcoming iphone. you inherently know the winner there. you'd be able to make all those smart decisions right away. i.e. get a prius, get a tivo, jump in on spotify, get netflix.

i was born in 1978... i met my ex-wife in 2000. i know the relationship doesn't work out, i likely wouldn't pursue it again. in 2000, both of my best friends were living with their grandparents. one i had grown up with, one i had just met. i know how well we clicked. so if i had that independently wealthy money, my thought would be to buy an apartment and live with my best friends. kind of like entourage.

if i'm doing the ""relive my life with my consciousness in my own body"" i know in 1990 buster douglas beats mike tyson and it pays 40:1... if i could come up with $1,000, i'd have $40,000 from 1990 to 2000 microsoft stock paid out 87:1... so that $1,000 would be worth about $2 million. repeat with apple stock in 2000, which pays out 10:1 by 2008 then bitcoin, which would make me a multibillionaire by the time i'm 40.

so 2000 i'd have a comfortable existence with a bit of an allowance with my two best friends and be able to relieve my 20s in nyc which would be amazing. then in 2010 i'd be worth about $20 million and could be kind of a jet setting playboy. sorta hollywood celebrity without the celebrity. then by 2020... i could do mogul shit, just have the money to fund all my favorite hobbies. i enjoy comic books, there's no reason i couldn't pull a todd macfarlane and just pay people to make my ideas. or fund like a blumhouse thing and get horror films i'd want to watch made. maybe even buy a videogame development studio and just angel investor everything.

that level of potential fun outweighs whatever ""sad"" i might experience via loved ones.

this is sort of a good segue into visiting the future.... if you go back in the past, there's an element of tourism. like if you went back to san francisco in the 1980s... you could've seen metallica as a bar band playing kill 'em all every night for a $5 cover.

or imagine going to seattle in the early 90s and going to a fucking house show and nirvana is playing bleach in someone's backyard.

the future would have more elements like that. for instance.. if you jumped from 2008 to 2018, you could've binge watched the entire mcu universe and seen everything from the first iron man to avengers: endgame in a weekend without the years of waiting. i imagine visiting the future would be kind of like that, spend a year and just get caught up on all the greatest, just 10/10 media that's come out without any waiting. 

but going in to the future would have its own potential pitfalls. the thought experiment i just laid out... skipping ahead and enjoying 10 years of the mcu in a weekend and it'd be a blast. 20 years ago we had the internet finally becoming usable. 30 years ago gaming and computers became mainstream. 40 years ago the music industry and hollywood blockbusters.

50 years forward would be pretty rad and enjoyable based off what you're familiar with. also kind of neat to check in on family and friends and see how they're doing. i bet some of my friends kids turned out hella awesome.

but if you were to go back 100 years. 1922? the advances from 1922 to now are just too numerous, fucking television wasn't even a thing, international travel by airplane? phone calls were a fucking novelty. talking pictures weren't even around. you'd have a vague notion of what's going on, but it's so far advanced, it'd take you at least a year to acclimate yourself. 

now if you were to go go 200 years back... 1822... while you could speak english and communicate, the world would be so incredibly different and strange. there's virtually nothing resembling a professional sport we'd know today, there's occasionally opera and maybe a play but that's it for popular culture, no singers, no bands, no movie stars, forget about shit like a tiktok influencer. 

the example i give is if a cowboy from 1822 wanted to get a drink of water. his first thought is 'where's the well?"" but in 2022... ""well, you'd need a utility, do you have an e-mail address? okay, let's get you an internet account. do you have a credit card? okay.. we're gonna need to get you to the bank and get you a debit card. do you have a phone number?"" 

all that stuff makes sense to use, but would be mind bogglingly bafflingly to that cowboy and all seem completely unnecessary and frustrating. so jumping 200 years in the future, the innovations would be fucking insane, but it'd be a lot of stuff you would never have even conceptualized. 

i think that cowboy could eventually get up to speed, especially if you did the whole ""compound interest"" independently wealthy thing. but i think it'd take at least two to three years with assistance from very helpful understanding people before you could be ""independent.""

like you'd have to teach the cowboy how to drive, potentially how to read and write. use the internet. it could be done, but it wouldn't be easy.

in terms of visiting the future, i'd treat it like skipping forward every 10 years and then spending a year or two there depending on how dope it was. and just kinda progressing at your normal life span. it'd be like if someone started out in 1922 at 20 and then hung around for two years and by the time you're in 2022 you'd only be 40.",2,,supergooduser,0

what if your parents bought in detroit, mi? prices have barely gone up 20% since 2000. what if your parents had bought in apple stock instead? the valuation of apple stock has 400x since 2000. assuming a down payment of $50k in 2000, they could have $20m in apple stock right now. what if your parents lost their jobs and had to sell at the trough in 2008?

not convinced by my completely hypothetical scenario based off actual real numbers?

i rented a room from my coworker who bought a house. we were both really into the financial independence thing at the time, so we shared numbers and debated this sort of thing often. we made about the same money, and my rent covered 1/3 of her mortgage. he paid out of pocket for the water main leak, the roof repair, and the ac unit dying. 3 years into owning the house, a family member was diagnosed with cancer and he moved back home to help with his family. he sold the house at a slight profit and after factoring in repairs, fees, and interest, ended up about $10k up. in the period of time that i rented, the money i had invested was up about $20k.

to reiterate, there are plenty of people who's choice to own their primary residence was a great financial decision that was better than renting. i know plenty of people in nyc, la, sf, hong kong who are way better off having bought than rented. the point of my comment is that everyone's situation is different, and you have to do the math. you can't put out a blanket statement that buying is *always* better than renting, because that's simply not always true.",17,,Raveen396,0

point of control (the level where the highest number of buyers &amp; sellers step in) since august 2020: $82.67, which is also an area of support since july 2021.

and right now we're trading again near that zone.

macros are shitty, yes, but $amd got much stronger than in 2020 (when people assumed that its only growth prospects were from stealing $intc's market share) and 2021 (when $amd was muted because of the overhang of the $amd+$xlnx deal) thanks to the xilinx and pensando acquisition. we're in an environment where the cloud business is still growing (see $orcl earnings) and where they can still grow even if the pc market shrinks in the worst-case scenario because all they'd have to do is keep stealing $intc's and $nvda's market share in the high margin datacenter sector.

check msft's earnings growth over the past 5 years.  it's forecast to continue.  they have nearly doubled their net income since 2019 (pandemic).  why would their pre-pandemic price be relevant?  how can they possibly trade at pre-pandemic prices when m2 money supply has nearly 2x'ed and their profits have nearly 2x'ed since pre-pandemic?

1655204782,"when people as what the largest company in the world is, do you think they are talking about square footage? ask a hundred people what the largest company is and i bet almost all of them will say ‚Äúapple‚Äù.  but yes, tesla‚Äôs market cap is obviously based on their future performance rather than today‚Äôs performance, but i have to point out how obviously biased you are against the company. it‚Äôs the only car company that is consistently growing above 50% year over year- currently it‚Äôs growing around 80%, in a time where legacy auto like gm and ford have been shrinking every quarter since 2017.  no other car company (besides ferrari which is a small blip) makes 20-30% profit margins off their cars except tesla. most make 2-10% and most ev cars sold by legacy auto actually loose money on every ev just so they can attempt to compete with tesla. 

tesla also actually makes more profit than ford and gm and many other car companies. they are the number one car brand in several countries and that will grow every quarter. meanwhile ford, vw, gm, bmw, virtually every legacy auto company, are going to have to lay off most of their workers and close most of their ice car factories if they hope to survive the transition to ev by 2030. many will not survive. 

byd certainly will survive. they are really the only current competitor of tesla. if i had time, i would study byd more and maybe invest in them as well, but i‚Äôd rather invest in a company i know and understand more, and believe in more. tesla does only have 4 models right now - which is brilliant, as gm and bmw and all all the others are failing drastically because they can‚Äôt mass produce dozens of new models. once tesla can scale more batteries, we will indeed start seeing the cybertruck, which will quickly crush all competition in its class, and the semi truck, and eventually we will see a cheaper model that will be the model to bring tesla up past 10, 15, 20 million cars per year. it‚Äôs a simple plan that has been described on the mission statement of the tesla website, and tesla always so far completes their plans. just look at their new factories- the austin gigafactory is the largest building by floor space in the entire world. so no, i am not worried at all when tsla drops along with macro during a recession. i don‚Äôt lose a penny until i sell. i‚Äôm old enough to have been through a few recessions, and i was not worried when my apple stock got cut in half during the last recession. it still grew 10x during the time i owned it. 

what makes it so easy to invest in tsla is that you can just go out and test their products. just like apple. when you first compared an iphone to an android phone, did you ever have any doubt that apple would own the smartphone market? i didn‚Äôt have any doubt. the same goes with tesla. go test drive one. go read the satisfaction surveys where no cars come close to tesla for the last 3 years. talk to any tesla car owner. look around any big city. tesla cars are loved, and they blow away every other car. once you drive one, you buy one. then investing in the company is simply a no-brainer.",1,,BMWbill,0

remember - their wealth is stock market assets, company ownership, etc.  not cash in a bank account.

1655240958,"a couple of things.  $msft, and the market, are clearly in downtrends right now.  it is not the best time to be opening bullish positions unless you are long oil, gas, or materials right now.  even there it looks like these might be finally starting to cave under the downward pressure with ung, xom, and a few others struggling a bit at these levels.

your idea of writing aggressive calls isn't a horrible idea.  you're going to get about $600-$800/week depending on volatility so it is a good way to recoup some of your losses.  on the other hand, you have 18 months to make this back.  if you do think this is the start of a longer term bear market like 2001 or 2008 rather than just a flash-crash like 2018 and 2020, then your best option is not to play around and just get out now for as little damage as you can.  only you can make this decision.  traders are usually naturally optimistic so it doesn't surprise me that a good portion of the comments are to just hold and it will come back.  however, you bought a $205 strike, that's only 20% away, which is not that much of a stretch if a sustained bear market is on the horizon.

go with your gut, but make sure you do research first.  don't just hodl because hodling is cool.  don't just sell because you are panicking that you are down a few thousand (assuming this isn't a huge deal as you let on in your post).  if you really want to try and salvage the position, writing weeklies is a smart thing to do.  based on what i can see, it looks like if you started churning weeklies would cap your max loss moving forward to about $6500 (assuming you only sold 1 call for next week).  i think there's a very good possibility you can write away $6k in premium.  bi-weekly, 0.3 delta is going to net you ~$300-$350.  if my math is correct, and you sell nothing but aiming for $350 every two weeks, assuming you never get called away, you will earn $12,600 in premium from now until then. 

if your call costed you more than that, abandon it.  if it was less than that, and you think there's even a small chance it could rally or bounce in the next 18 months, then hold onto it because you may come out green on this at the end of it all.  it might not be as green as you wanted, but hell, taking even $200 in profits (after commissions) is much better than taking a $6.5k+ loss.",4,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0

1655291675,"there‚Äôs a big difference between knowingly killing someone and someone dying because nobody knew they were there. let‚Äôs first be clear on the meaning of the legal terms you‚Äôre providing.

definition of **negligent homicide**: ‚Äúnegligent homicide is a criminal charge brought against a person who, through criminal negligence, allows another person to die.‚Äù¬π

and in order to define negligent homicide, we must define criminal negligence. 

**criminal negligence** is defined as: ...‚Äúwhe[n] a person ignores an obvious risk or disregards the life and safety of those around him.‚Äù

i think the key phrase here is ‚Äúobvious risk.‚Äù you are correct that most women don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre pregnant at the literal moment of conception (which, by the way, *is* the moment life begins¬≥, according to science‚Å¥‚Äî assuming you prefer scientific facts). therefore, there is no ‚Äúobvious risk,‚Äù given that the woman may have very little indication that she is pregnant. early on, there is no way for her to know for sure that there is life inside her without taking a pregnancy test, which she doesn‚Äôt necessarily have cause to do if she doesn‚Äôt suspect she might be pregnant. therefore, there is no ‚Äúobvious risk‚Äù component, meaning she is not guilty of criminal negligence, and thus not guilty of negligent homicide.

now, you might be able to piece together some sort of argument out of this *if* the woman knows she is pregnant, but otherwise, the legality of the issue would not hold up for you in a court of law. it‚Äôs unlikely you could even make a case for civil negligence here. good try (really), and an interesting thought exercise, but i don‚Äôt think you could successfully convince anyone of this being a legitimate concern.

over the last 20 years of pc building/gaming, xfx have been the only two cards i've had that failed and weren't covered under warranty.  the first was an xfx nvidia gtx 260 core 216 black edition(the core 216 was because the regular 260 had 192 cuda cores and the 216 had 216...  it was the ""ti"" before they called it ""ti"").  that one would overheat unless i underclocked it to the nvidia stock settings(as in the nvidia specs and not the factory oc from xfx). it completely died after 2 years which was just outside of warranty which was also the first year xfx stopped doing lifetime warranties.

the second was a xfx ati 5850 non referance card.  it also lasted just past the two year warranty.

i've never had problems with evga(8800gts, 9800gt in a second system), asus (7600gt), sapphire(9970, 480, vega 64) or so far my brand new asrock 6750 but that's too early to tell.

anyway, i'm sure that xfx makes some good cards.  they used to have a lifetime warranty and a great reputation.  they traded both of those for additional profits.  i personally prefer sapphire for amd or evga for nvidia, but decided to take a chance on asrock currently.  ymmv.",6,,DrunkenTrom,0

1655355895,"crypto allows you to do *online* crime. you can order drugs to your door like you're shopping on amazon. unless you use something like monero or you launder through things like nfts, it's probably traceable in the long run, but criminals aren't always smart. crypto also creates new industries of crime that couldn't really exist without it, like ransomware. most crime in the cryptoverse aren't the darknet markets, though. it's simpler things, like running ponzi schemes without having to register as a security by getting ahead of the regulators who are too slow to catch on.

the only value people see in bitcoin is number-goes-up. if it didn't exist, they might fomo into chasing past performance in something like apple stock instead. if they did that, they might accidentally make money instead of losing it even though you can very easily lose money in the stock market if you don't know what you're doing (or if you do).

stocks are speculation on future *profits*. bitcoin doesn't have future profits. instead, there's a fixed cost to running the network. some money has to flow out in order to pay for the electricity bills of the miners. at least, if the miners aren't using debt and issuing shares to avoid selling, which many of them were able to do in the wild market conditions of 2021. they still have bags that they have to unload, though. they just delayed the inevitable and now prices are much lower.

bitcoin as a technology for sending peer to peer ""money"" works just as well at $1 or at $1,000 as it does at the current price. bitcoin's just as useful for that purpose as bitcoin cash or litecoin or dogecoin or any number of alternatives. in fact, the alternatives are almost certainly cheaper. even if you use it, it doesn't mean that you should ""invest"" in it or expect it to go up. the only reason the number goes up is because of wash trading on unregulated exchanges, just like in the mt. gox days. regulation would kill the reason to ""invest"" in it because this wouldn't happen anymore.

[raising interest rates will have other undesirable effects to the economy. company valuations will reduce, borrowing costs will go up so they will either freeze hiring, freeze pay and/or start layoffs. this can affect population's ability to pay mortgages, rents, cc loans etc. borrowing costs for individuals will also be higher so that will have a gravity effect on the residential market when people either cannot or are unwilling to borrow to buy homes. this is usually when the bailouts occur (not necessarily in terms of paychecks like it was in the pandemic, but usually by the cb reducing the interest rates and buying assets).](/r/stockmarket/comments/vbdpmv/welcome_to_bear_market_today_sp500_dropped_20/icak8ky/)

there is apple stock, and ms stock. it's that simple. how did that happen? because both companies made and to continue to make computing accessible to people who don't care about the gnome project. because they don't have to. 

they don't have to care about devs leaving projects because of adwaita or some shit. all they care about is how to get apps and services. on devices that actually work, unlike the pine phone. 

they don't want to have people shout ""read the goddamn wiki!"" when their os breaks. they spent money on hardware and software. why? because what's being sold off of shelves is supposed to work, and brand loyalty is a thing in case anyone doesn't realize that simple concept. 

people that resent success probably haven't achieved much of that on their own, and torvalds himself can come off like a very prickly person, but he's not a total marxist either. he just doesn't sell hardware to own that percentage of the marketshare, or have oems reluctant to use linux to ship on their hardware because of devs leaving projects because of fucking adwaita.",2,,DickNDiaz,0

1655398891,"ok so the idea of a ""tax class"" in high school or college that could impart any meaningful information is a fallacy. tax lawyers and cpa's go to tons of classes to get enough knowledge to do what you are talking about effectively. there is no shame in going to someone and saying i'd like you to do your job and i'll pay you to do that job. particularly when the job is complex and requires a lot of study. you don't tell a builder you are going to build your house yourself, don't tell a cpa you are going to do your taxes yourself. that is with a caveat: simple taxes are actually as simple as they appear and you can do them if you want. just like you might build a shed yourself since its simple. if you feel you know enough to do your taxes, maybe get some advice, but give it a try. if you don't, there is no ""dishonor"" thats going to befall you.   


the same could be said of a lot of things: don't buy a home without both a realter and a lawyer. i know there is some sort of stigma here, but they literally went to school for a very long time to make sure they knew what they are doing, you didn't. you don't know contract law, or any of the other vast number of things involved to make sure you aren't getting screwed. you don't even need to hire the lawyer. they will charge a one time fee to look at the contracts of both the purchase and the loan and tell you if its standard stuff or if someone is trying to screw you. more over if you get the right lawyer they will tell you if something that should be there isn't such as a home inspection, or a clause that lets you out of the purchase if something undisclosed is found in the house and so on. there is no shame in asking for help from an expert. particularly in a situation where screwing up can saddle you with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.  


as far as investing goes you can try it yourself if you are confident in one thing: you can do without the money. i'd argue that investing, no matter how you do it, should be done with money that you aren't in need of. investing, through a broker, through a service or anything else is gambling. the odds are in your favor more than at a casino, but still it is gambling. you can however invest in safer or riskier ways depending on how you want the money to work for you. for instance investing in apple or google (abc) or microsoft are all ""safe"" bets. they aren't 100% sure things, but they are 80-90% likely to increase over time, but they increase slowly. other things (ventures and riskier investments like futures and so on) can lose your shirt or strike you rich. here are a few things to remember:   


any business can fold. no matter how big, even apple can string a set of bad choices into complete bankruptcy. the main thing there is how long it takes. it'll take apple or walmart longer to fold than say churches chicken.   


a savings account is an investment. however it builds value very slowly (it has an apr just like your credit card) and its got a certain amount of security built into it. the bank is taking the risk that their investment with your money will not go belly up. so they give you a return when they make money with your money, and if they lose it, they replace it.   


never gamble with money you cannot afford to lose. its the unfortunate truth of investment banking that poor people cannot and should not partake. there are a lot of loses in it and often you can spend days just riding waves of investments trying to get back out what you put in. if you need that money and its tied up you could look at losing something you need even more.   


you have a better shot with a stock broker, but nothing is 100%. if you invest be ready to take a loss. even apple stock just dropped the other day.   


all in all the best piece of advice i can give you is that the world only really expects you to have enough knowledge to check the work of those who you ask for help. no one can know everything, and most certainly no one can be an expert in everything. however if you hire reputable experts, and educate yourself enough to be able to look at their work and know its not wrong, then you should be ok.",4,,mizino,0

what are you on about? you lock in collateral to borrow dai.

1655406100,"‚Äúpeople buy crypto the same as they buy stocks‚Äù just because you buy crypto and stocks on an exchange doesn‚Äôt mean crypto and stocks are equivalent. you can buy commodities on an exchange as well as a wide variety of derivatives. you can buy crypto at kiosks in walmarts now but i haven‚Äôt seen a stock kiosk in walmart yet.

crypto currency trading is better equated to currency speculation or purchasing items for collectible value speculation. no one would not say ‚Äúpeople buy euros the same as they buy stocks‚Äù. stocks are literally buying a part of a company, you literally own a part of apple and all that come with that when you buy apple stock which is much different than buying doge coin.

one similarity (which is why i think you say they are the same) is that some people buy both stocks and crypto without necessarily understanding or caring about the underlying value and just look at how the sale price changes over time. crypto and stocks are both valued based on sentiment but the reasons behind the sentiment are vastly different.

1655411080,"socialism =/= planned economy. the simplest definition is simply the people owning the means of production. this can occur through the government(which represents the people) controlling the means of production, or the workers(through unions or co-ops) owning the means of production.  
  
the intent is that someone or a group of shareholders owning the means of production simply leech value that the workers create and pay them back a fraction of what they produce. obviously in a small business the owner often does a lot of work and may actually take home a relatively fair share, but shareholders for example provide nothing to the company(past the initial investment), but continue to reap the benefits at the cost of the workers. even if you value that initial investment highly, you can look at established companies, say apple. if you go and buy apple stock, you contribute nothing to the company and yet leech value that the workers produced.  
  
i‚Äôll also note that historically ‚Äúattempts‚Äù at  socialism have been government controlled. i put attempt in brackets because i believe no socialist government has ever been started with good intentions, rather they have all started as dictatorships claiming to be socialist. i‚Äôm also more a fan of socialism not being state controlled, and rather controlled by the workers as it is a more direct line of power to the workers.",-1,,anotherDrudge,0
1655413010,"how about we talk about why individual valid projects have value above $0...

your comparison is like asking why the stock market has value... penny stocks, junk bonds, and all.

you are bunching everything into the same category and that's unrealistic on both ends. crypto market right now is the same as pre-depression market of the 1920s... unregulated, full of valid projects as well as scams... and valid projects that others outside of the project actually use to scam others (just look at rca stock manipulation during that period)

so what would prevent btc from going to zero? few things, fundamentally the value is built into the mining process through the 1st law of thermodynamics. in fact, it is the most efficient transfer of value based on the 2nd law of thermodynamics as well.

example... if it costs a mining operation $20k to mine 10oz of gold, they will not sell said gold for $5k... right? they will sell it for their operating cost, their overall expenses... plus a profit. correct? bitcoin is no different... that is why in many cases btc is compared to gold... not because it is a store of value but it is a way of extracting value from one medium to another. this principle applies in many different forms.

secondly, btc is a solid payment network that allows for nearly instant transfer of funds across the globe... you can even make payments in space if you have internet signal... actually they have transferred btc payments over ham radio, so there's that. i digress... btc itself is great for large transactions. 90% of high end luxury real estate is paid for in btc because the fees are low and red tape is much easier to clear. it's not a way to skirt taxes because they are all paid, it's not a way to get dark money in because cash is much more difficult to trace. it's just easier. also, with the lightning network as the layer 2 solution, btc is a great payment system that can provide payment validation nearly instantly... about as fast if not faster than credit cards.

thirdly, like i mentioned before, there is a potential of 30% of the world population to receive real time banking services with btc, services that they don't have right now. yes, there is volatility but so was volatility in apple stock in the 80s.... did you remember what people were saying about amazon in the 2000s? in fact as late as 2010 people were saying amazon was a complete and utter failure and that investing in it was stupid... most of those people own amazon stock now. you can't discount the entire market because it is volatile... all emerging markets are that way during adoption phase.

want to talk eth? it is a great smart contract platform that allows businesses and individuals to create self executing smart contracts. want to buy and sell real-estate? sweet... eth has the ability, right now... this very moment... to create a smart contract for purchase of a home and issue payment when certain conditions are met. this means escrow and title industry is in danger of being extinct. this is just one of the examples of how smart contracts can change the every day world we live in.

there are hundreds of examples just like these two, and for each one of them there are dozen or so shitcoins and scams.

let's compare two scenarios: 1) quit immediately and sell all meta stock. 2) look for a new job, but stay until you find one. sell meta during next trading window or when you start your new job, whichever comes first.

so let's say you do 1) and quit tomorrow to sell meta. you'll get the 400k in vested stock in cash. but you'll lose your next vest (and all future vest) plus you're immediately without income until you get your next job, which will take at least 1-2 months assuming you get interviews immediately, pass them, and have a starting date set.

your next vest at this point might be something like 30k (i'm making up this number). plus you'll be missing something like 20-40k in base salary while you stay unemployed. so hypothetically you'll be missing out on like 60k pre-tax income in a best case scenario just for the sake of selling your stock 2 months early.

so basically you have to believe that your stock will drop by at least 10-15% more in the next two months and that you'll easily get another comparable job in 1-2 months for this to be even worth thinking about. if either of those don't happen, you're just screwing yourself even more.

1655487189,"&gt;for many investors, yes. the goal of acquiring assets is to sell it to someone else for a higher value.   you're absolutely correct there.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;but stocks, money markets and other financial instruments have value that benefits a long term investors who do not sell and hold for long term.  remember, stocks are a share of ownership of a company.  ownership means you're entitled to dividends and if you acquire enough shares, you have control of the company.   let's pretend tomorrow, that everyone but you has a shared delusion and dumps all their apple stock. nothing is different about apple's business. they're still selling the same amount of consumer electronics, they still have the same employees, patents, etc etc.  you acquire 50% + 1 of all apple stocks. congratulations, now you control apple, you control their reserve cash in the bank, you can fire the ceo, you can sell all their property and patents and liquidate the company.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;same imaginary scneario happens with bitcoin. everyone dumps their bitcoin and you acquire all of them. what can you do?   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;for a real world example, look at the town of quincy, fl. the residents during the 20's and 30's acquired shares of cocacola and held for generations.  coca-cola has paid them dividends that they can  use to buy food, pay mortgage, etc

if you wanted to make money off of crypto tech. you would buy stock in the small tech company that are writing code, deploying security software for crypto, and designing the best computers for mining crypto as efficiently as possible. buying the coin itself is not an investment in it as much as people who shill the coins themselves like to say.

i hope that sort of explains it to you.

1655606134,"i was wondering about this approach as well. i‚Äôve never tried anything like it, and am curious about mechanics.

if you were in ops situation on the aapl puts, what specific calls would you sell here to hedge and bring in capital? how would it actually play out for risk/reward?

say you decide the first step is to sell the december 150 calls at 33 delta. they look to have closed at about $6.13 midpoint. 

will most brokers treat this as not using any additional bp since the calls are effectively covered by the deep itm puts? you‚Äôd still need options approval for naked calls right? it does still increase risk as there‚Äôs now increased risk if there was a huge upside move. but the upside risk would only really start at 165 as for every dollar between 150 and 165 your loss on the calls would be offset by recovery on the puts?

so would op get $600 per sold call to use against the margin call?

what would happen then without a roll on the puts?

if aapl stock kept dropping, the calls would lose value, though only at about 1/3 the delta that the short puts would have making them more expensive. how much downside breathing room do you think this would buy? 4-5$?

but it would also guarantee op a loss if apple recovered, right? just a smaller loss than he‚Äôs looking at now, i guess. best case he‚Äôd be out $1500 per contract if aapl ended somewhere between 150 and 165?

if you roll the put down and out further in time, does it still ‚Äúcover‚Äù the shorter naked call? or you‚Äôd roll the call too?",5,,LaughGullible5253,0

1655662033,"your q is pretty much answered by another member, but i'll just go into details:

&gt;say you decide the first step is to sell the december 150 calls at 33 delta. they look to have closed at about $6.13 midpoint. 

sell dec 150c for ~$6, roll down the short put to 160p for ~$2 credit. since it's a inverted strangle, collateral is ( depending on broker and underlying) 30% of the original short put plus the width of calls and puts ($1k per contract).
any extra collateral requirement is covered by margin on aapl stock. the collateral on the short put would also be lowered since it's been roll down.

&gt;what would happen then without a roll on the puts?

if op doesn't roll the put, op gets cash premium on the short calls but can't reduce margin requirement of the original short put

&gt;if aapl stock kept dropping, the calls would lose value, though only at about 1/3 the delta that the short puts would have making them more expensive. how much downside breathing room do you think this would buy? 4-5$?

in this case, keep rolling both calls and puts down. width of the inversion will continue to increase but short put collateral would also reduce to avoid margin call. thankfully the underlying is aapl so there's a bottom for the fundamental guys to come in and buy, so op won't have a chance to roll to 0.

&gt;but it would also guarantee op a loss if apple recovered, right? just a smaller loss than he‚Äôs looking at now, i guess. best case he‚Äôd be out $1500 per contract if aapl ended somewhere between 150 and 165?

reverse this entire operation when market turns around. the pivotal point is very important as in if you don't get too overzealous on selling the calls, you can let it expire/close otm and just roll down and out the put to recover, given there's enough theta.

&gt;if you roll the put down and out further in time, does it still ‚Äúcover‚Äù the shorter naked call? or you‚Äôd roll the call too?

if you have enough stock to cover the short calls (aka covered call), you can manage each side separately. in op case, since he doesn't have enough, i would manage as a strangle.",2,,Br1ll1antly1llog1cal,0

1655867916,"&gt;	i have stock in apple. despite what the legal definition may say, i do not own anything. 

yahoo finance reports that right now each apple stock share owns $23.47 of apple‚Äôs annual revenue which compared to the same quarter last year is 8.6% higher. apple‚Äôs profit margin is ~26% so about a quarter of that revenue is new wealth apple created out of thin air just by doing what they do. part of their profits apple reinvests in their business so it keeps growing. part of their profits apple uses to pay dividends and buyback shares which lifts apple stock share prices. 

&gt;	i have no influence over apple or any of their decisions. 

your influence over apple and their decisions is scaled by the fraction of the company you own. each year apple investors cast votes on the leadership of the company and other issues leaders of apple feel that investors should directly decide: https://appletogether.org/shareholders.html 

you may feel powerless with the shares you own but realize apple is a 2.2 trillion dollar company. if you feel strongly about something and can convince enough shareholders you have the power to influence / replace apple‚Äôs leadership.  if shareholders had no influence why would for example elon musk buy a large fraction of twitter and offer to buy the rest? he is buying influence.

&gt;	to retail investors, a stock is the same thing as a crypto coin. 

here you have identified the problem.  one is a share in a ponzi scheme that will at some future time collapse. the other is fractional ownership in an ongoing enterprise that makes the world a better place and creates wealth out of thin air just by doing what it does. they are _very different_ but i agree for many retail investors: ‚Äúa stock is the same thing as a crypto coin.‚Äù here you have identified _the problem_.

&gt;	i would ask, what asset does a dollar represent? 

in the past national currencies used to represent claims on treasure: gold / silver etc. this worked poorly so no sensible country does this any more. today currency is whatever the government pays their workers with and accepts for tax payments from all their citizens. if people in the country trust their government they will hold that currency despite the fact that every year they are being charged a service fee for holding it. this service fee is called ‚Äúinflation‚Äù. it prevents people hoarding the currency and among other things is automatic debt forgiveness so the national economy does not choke up with debt. the value of each unit of national currency (dollar, etc) is manipulated on purpose so unemployment stays low and prices stay short term stable (but long term climb per inflation rate). countries that do this well grow and prosper. the purpose of currencies is to facilitate value exchange in an economy. currencies are not investments. all good currencies charge an inflation fee to hold them. no exceptions. 

&gt;	the question here is what asset does bitcoin represent? if i hold a bitcoin, it represents nothing until it is exchanged for some other asset. for some it will become food. for others it will become debt. for some, it may be their retirement. until that value is actualized, we‚Äôre all speculating what it may become.

yes! ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all _speculating_ what it may become.‚Äù unlike shares of apple and units of a national currency the value bitcoin is not tied to any obvious productive activity. it is based on _speculation_ supported by misunderstanding of how investing and money works, that suckers sucking suckers will not run out of suckers, etc. this speculation is further fueled by disgust and discontent people have with banks and governments.

mind you there is a ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù for cryptocurrencies - an application for which they are uniquely suited for. nothing else offers global, censorship proof, anonymous and irreversible financial transactions of a type that are otherwise difficult. 

what might those transaction types be? (hint: crime payments, ransoms, tax evasion, theft, ‚Ä¶) what factions of society might be attracted to such transactions? is having more of such transactions desirable? i suppose it depends who you are.

&gt;	we‚Äôre actively working on improving many of the criticisms with blockchain technology such as power consumption‚Ä¶ if we are successful, and the cost and speed of transactions is competitive with traditional finance‚Ä¶

if you doubt the desirability of ‚Äúglobal, censorship proof, anonymous and irreversible financial transactions of a type that are otherwise difficult‚Äù, would you be excited by efforts to make such transactions cheaper and faster? 

&gt;	or because no one knows the future, crypto will crash and burn and we all go back to complaining about how corrupt and broken traditional finance is. 

intelligence evolved to help animals ‚Äúknow the future‚Äù. for example, inside our heads we have intuitive physics models that allow us to make remarkably quick and accurate _short term predictions_ about velocities, moments of inertia, momentum, ... what a skilled soccer player can do is simply amazing. you can easily tell them apart from unskilled players.

ability with _long term predictions_ is harder to judge and obviously takes longer to verify. in the hard sciences we can accurately predict events centuries into the future. economics is not a mature hard science yet it has ample predictive power already. it predicted that the deflationary design of bitcoin would render it useless as a currency. and you need not be an economics genius to predict that any ‚Äúsuckers suckering suckers‚Äù path to wealth will eventually run out of suckers and collapse. when it will happen is unknown but there is _absolutely zero doubt_ it will collapse. zero doubt. zero. 

&gt;	you know what else is seemingly a waste of energy? social media. would bitcoin have ever reached its highs without it? would the misinformation and deceit by bad actors have propagated the way it did without it? would gme have happened without reddit? but here we are conveniently participating in something that we know sometimes results in a lot of good and sometimes a lot of bad because it is not the platform, but it‚Äôs bad actors that poison the well. ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre a member of reddit, and reddit has had its fair share of trash and legal scandals and yet here we are. why?

are you russian? ever argue with a russian? they have this rhetorical technique they like to use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism - ‚Äúresponding to an accusation or difficult question by making a counter accusation or raising a different issue.‚Äù, it helps ‚Äúpeople who know themselves to be guilty of something find comfort in finding others to be just as bad or worse.‚Äù, etc. visit /r/askarussian some there are masters at it. (note: i respect / admire ordinary russian people despite the actions of their leaders who victimize their own citizens as much as others. )

&gt;	saying ‚Äúcrypto is a scam‚Äù is like saying ‚Äúreddit is a cult‚Äù.  

above i said ‚Äúcryptocurrencies are interesting for the algorithms they employ to create robust ad hoc distributed systems, etc. what is bad about them is how they are being used and promoted.‚Äù

when you research cognitive biases, human judgement errors, ‚Äúdark patterns‚Äù and how to build things that are insanely ‚Äúaddictive by design‚Äù, the research and lab experiments and documentation of these things are worthwhile and legitimate projects. 

when you deploy this research ( casinos, video ‚Äúgames‚Äù with loot boxes etc, ponzi ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù) to cheat people out of their money now you have a scam. that you have willing victims and that what you are doing is not  ‚Äúillegal‚Äù changes nothing. when public perceptions change, laws change, ‚Ä¶

many crypto currencies are _both_ legitimate projects _and_ scams. jim jones helped many people over the course of his life but he also hurt many people. like jim jones cryptocurrencies are being judged by the balance of being good vs bad. being one does not preclude being the other.

&gt;	i agree with much of what you‚Äôve said and i think your intent is honorable. if you think you can have a positive influence on the human condition then i will cheer you on. it‚Äôs a tough job. i can design, implement and operate just about anything in cloud computing. that is easy. changing humanity‚Äôs flaws are infinitely more difficult.

cheering does not help. find the holes in what i have shared with you. tell me why i am wrong. tell me what you find unconvincing. if you become convinced then go and convince others. pay me back for saving you by saving others.

1655902595,"not true, interestingly. i actually wrote a script for a blog post exploring this topic which i still haven't got round to writing an publishing yet, but the fastest way in php to calculate the nth term of the fibonacci sequence is a straight up iterative loop of adding numbers. my script tested the performance of iteration, recursion, tail recursion and the golden ratio formula, both using regular ints up to the limit of php\_int\_max and using bcmath for larger values.

for example, to calculate the nth term using the formula via bcmath, the code looks something like this:

        $magic = bcsqrt(""5"");
    $a = bcpow(bcdiv(bcadd(""1"", $magic), ""2""), (string)$n);
    $b = bcpow(bcdiv(bcsub(""1"", $magic), ""2""), (string)$n);
    $c = bcdiv(""1"", $magic);
    $v = bcsub(bcmul($c, $a), bcmul($c, $b));
    return bcadd($v, ""0.5"", 0);

there's actually quite a lot of work going on there. but the iterative approach

        if ($n &lt;= 2) {
        return 1;
    }
    $a = $b = 1;
    for ($i=2; $i &lt; $n; $i++) {
        list($a, $b) = [$b, bcadd((string)$a,  (string)$b)];
    }
    return bcadd($b, ""0.5"", 0);

although that for loop may be running hundreds of times, it's much more simple. it's *fast*, because it's just adding numbers together. and your computer is *really* good at adding numbers, it can do it a lot faster than it can calculate square roots or even multiplication, because adding numbers is something your computer is highly optimized to do *at the hardware level.*",2,,gebbles1,0

1655904684,"&gt;what does it mean for the term of the loan to be related to the capital?

the loan has a purpose like purchasing a computer or paying a worker.  this is compared to something like a share which is used to declare a right to a portion of the profits.

&gt;and if the creditor charges you too much interest, the same thing happens.

yes, but it is transparent, you can understand the terms immediately, and it has a finality to paying back.

&gt;the two are effectively the same as far as the employees are concerned.

definitely not.  employees can see how long till the investment is payed back.  plus they can evaluate if the terms were fair.

&gt;you have to pay for capital one way or another, which means that you can't give all of the revenue to the employees.

exactly.  but if there is profits left over you know that is from excess labor which goes to the workers.

&gt;but they don't. they have to pay the interest on the debt.

and what is left over is profits.  that is how it even works today.

&gt;i have no idea what you're saying. what is the excess value of labour? what is a loan on the profits? how are wages a loan?

sorry, using the word 'loan' in two contexts was confusing.  i'll try to slow it down since this is really condensed.  revenue comes from labor + capital.  in an ideal world the value of the capital is subtracted from revenue (operating expenses), leaving only the labor. revenue - capital operating expense = profit  in this simple case that would be the repayment of the loan.  obviously the value of the labor should go to laborers.  the problem is laborers need to survive during this time period.  so we also take some money from our revenue and pay them periodically which is their wage or salary.  that money is also an operating expense.  so we have revenue - capital operating expense - labor operating expense = excess value of labor.  it is called excess value of labor because we already partially paid for the labor as a wage.  in a way, wages are a loan or advance on the profits so that workers can survive until the final profits can be distributed.

&gt;no, it hasn't been repaid. why do you think it has been repaid?

because at some point it will be repaid.  capital expenses are paid for by the business after the loan.

&gt;the investor leaves his capital invested in the company. without it, the workers wouldn't be able to generate any revenue.

that isn't how the investing works in the real world.  when you buy a share of the company they aren't using that money for anything after the initial capital formation.  so when you buy apple stock, they don't use that for anything.  the capital they need to produce comes from their operating expenses.  you are purely investing in the speculative value of the company.  this is also true with sole proprietorships.  this is the pivotal immorality of capitalism to me.  investing your capital is for the purpose of extracting the excess value of labor thus creating an incentive to underpay for labor, which is theft.

&gt;if the revenue came only from the workers, they would quit and form their own company

the profit comes from the workers, not the revenue.  the revenue is the capital and labor.  when you subtract out the value of the capital through paying operating expenses (repaying the loan) what you have left is the profit which comes entirely from labor.  now do you start to see why capitalism is immoral?  what they are saying is their capital investment entitles them the profits.  they are saying the labor is an operating expense, but what is left over must come from the capital...not the labor.  why?  because there is no loan to capture the value of the operating cost.  there is this nebulous concept of a share but the money for the capital and the money for the labor is muddled together so that they are both indistinguishable as expenses...meaning i guess this profit is all ours right guys?  they created an open-ended profit stealing mechanism for extracting wealth from labor.

&gt;the investor could sell the computer and spend the money right away.

not if they want to be paid back with interest which was why they loaned us the money in the first place.",1,,StrongTownsIsRight,0

1655909649,"&gt;could a stock theoretically go to zero even though the company has monetary worth? 

yes. 

now, apple has a current div yield of 0.67%. if you buy 1 share for current price of $137, you'll get about $0.90 back each year off your dollar. its a pretty low div yield.

however, let's say sentiment for apple stock plummeted, and the stock trades for 1 cent. $0.01 per share of apple. looking only at dividends, you would now make that same $0.90 cents that year for a measly $0.01 investment. this would represent a div yield of 900%. in other words (assuming apples business is operating as usual), you would have a guaranteed 900% roi that year from dividends alone.

en la fau primero lo primero estan los aviadores, que son los que vuelan los aviones basicamente (no significa que sea lo √∫nico que hagan), tambien hacen actividades de administracion, de mantenimiento y abastecimiento, controlan los vant, hacen cursos de armamento aereo, de prevencion de accidentes, de estandarizacion, hacen cursos de paracaidismo, de vant, tambien hay cursos de instructor de tiro, de inteligencia militar aerea, de mantenimiento de aviones, etc, los oficiales de la policia aerea nacional no se forman en la policia se forman en la fuerza aerea y son parte de la fuerza aerea, por ejemplo el nuevo jefe de estado mayor de la defensa es el general del aire(av) rodolfo pereyra bueno el trabajo unos a√±os en el destacamento de policia aerea nacional. en el escuadron de caza hacen constantes maniobras con las aeronaves para mantenerse entrenados, hacen actividades de tiro a√©reo(con cohetes y las armas propias de los aviones) y terrestre, actividades de lanzamiento de granadas, de patrullaje de fronteras,  van a aeropuertos a hacer acrobacias, van a una isla a bombardear, corren mucho tambien, no vuelan todos los d√≠as pero casi todos, estan pronto para ser desplegados en caso de que c.r.i.d.o.v.n.i(que tambien es de la fau) encuentre un potencial caso ovni, etc. en el escuadron de helicopteros, hacen actividades de tiro aereo con ametralladoras y tiro terrestre, actividades de entrenamiento de lucha contra incendios, constantemente hacen traslados sanitarios, hacen muchisimas maniobras de deslizamiento de cuerda, de instruccion a los nuevos militares subalternos y oficiales para mantenimiento(oficiales y subalternos) y vuelo(oficiales), apoyan a la escuela militar de aeronautica para sus actividades. el escuadron de combate se mantenia constantemente entrenado haciendo maniobras todas las semanas de lanzamiento de cohetes, de tiro aereo y terrestre, de bombarde a islas, de entrenamiento de personal, prontos para ser desplegados contra ovnis, corrian mucho tambien, etc, hablo de pasado porque ese cuartel se deshabilito hace unos a√±os cuando se deshabilitaron los pucaras que eran aviones de combate mejor que los cessna actuales y pilatus actuales, solo que estaban quedando muy viejos y el gobierno de ese momento no quiso comprar material nuevo, en unos a√±os seguramente vuelva cuando se modernice a la fuerza. el escuadron de vigilancia aerea es un escuadron encargardo de los radares nuestra fuerza para controlar el transito sobre nuestras rutas a√©reas teniendo varios radares moviles y otros fijos como el de santa clara del olimar. el escuadron de enlace es un escuadron encargado de los traslados sanitarios, esta a disposicion del gobierno, de los traslados de organos, etc, y la escuadrilla de enlace algo parecido, el entrenamiento de estos 2 es de tiro aereo y terrestre, correr mucho y hacen constantes maniobras para mantenerse entrenados y saber usar el material. el escuadron de transporte es el encargado del transporte aereo militar uruguayo que es algo que traslada gente del interior a montevideo o por lo menos antes lo hacia, esta en constantes maniobras de paracaidismo, tiro terrestre, llevar militares y civiles a la antartida, llevar viveres a la antartida, corren mucho tambien, van a buscar uruguayos parados en otros paises, etc. 

estos cuarteles estan en constantes maniobras y evaluaciones de prevencion de accidentes, de seguridad ocuopacional, de sus activades propias todos los a√±os, y se tienen que mantener bien entrenados para aprobar y sus militar todos los a√±os tienen pruebas de informatica y administracion para evaluarse.

eso los aviadores, los navegantes trabajan en los mismos cuarteles y tambien se mantienen igual de entrenados, hay varios tipos el de sanidad aeroespacial(trabajadores de la salud), de seguridad terrestre(policias aereos y los que controlan el material terrestre de los cuarteles, de meteorologia esta parte es muy importante, en todos los cuarteles hay una subdivision del servicio de meteorologia, y si buscas en google meteo fau te aparecera la p√°gina de meteorologia de la fau, esto sirve para mantener bien informado al persona sobre como esta el clima, de administracion y logistica, como bien dice el nombre le dan trabajos administrativos, electronica y comunicaciones, este personal se encarga de mantener a la fuerza informada entre si, usan las nuevas tecnologias, todos los cuarteles tienen una subdivision de esto, esta es la fuerza con mejor tecnologia, usan radares, se mantienen comunicados con los aviones, controlan el trafico a√©reo. etc.

los navegantes no vuelan aviones pero son igual de importantes que los aviadores, adem√°s de que se mantienen entrenados, tambien entran a aviones, por ejemplo hay aviones que tienen lugar para el navegante, el navegante se encarga de mantener las comunicaciones del avion con los cuarteles y administrar el combustible, etc.",8,,NecessaryMark3105,0

1655987282,"that's the main reason to use reference tracks, as they are often already mixed and mastered to the point they translate across a bunch of systems already.

also, software like soundid reference have translation checks built in so you can test what your song would sound like roughly in certain cars, laptops, tvs, etc.

the reason to mix on a more flat response curve is that you're best setting yourself up to translate to as many things as possible with the fewest major discrepancies. you should also test your mix on as many devices as you can, if you have multiple headphones, bt speaker, your own phone, your own car, etc. a great mix/master is going to take multiple renders and readjustments; as well as giving your ears a rest and revisiting the following day or hours after a break so you're not making bad decisions from ear fatigue.

at the end of the day though, if the majority of people listen to music on crappy plastic apple stock headphones, i don't think that you should move your goalpost to accommodate bad quality, because then if you ever did get to the big stage and your song is played at a major club or stadium, and the bass is absolutely blown out, you won't be thinking, oh well, at least my song sounded good on the worst devices.",2,,b_lett,0

if everyone stops using a crypto token, and it's value goes to 0, do you still get any form of real physical wealth from it? i get your point of owning a token itself provides value by increasing the security of the network, but if you're the only one holding a token and no one else wants it, it's value is completely gone.",2,,spookyswagg,0

1656003684,"&gt;sentiment for the semi sector is down.

yes, it's down for the semi sector, but why in the world should that matter? it makes absolutely no sense. are you telling me that big money can't see past sector wide sentiment to find the stocks in that sector that are actually over performing and not seeing the same issues its competitors are? what's the point of ""big"" or ""smart"" money if they can't see a company that is standing out amongst all its competitors and is severely undervalued? 

i remember seeing a post talking about $msft during the dotcom bubble where $qqq kept going down  but $msft ended up stabilizing and not following the market to its final bottom. so, sector wide sentiment shouldn't matter, as it did in the case of $msft and likely others back then. 

to top it all off, $amd is still ""minuscule"" compared to intel and nvidia, not only in marketshare but also mindshare. what this means is that if amd can perform, they can grow even in a semi sector that is getting smaller. the good thing is, for people who actually follow amd, we already know it's not a matter of if or when because amd is performing right now and dominating in the area that matters most for investors, datacenter. if amd had 80% marketshare, then i would find it easier to understand the constant selling of amd when sentiment for semi sector is down. 

oh well, i hope $amd eventually gets the valuation it deserves.",4,,yallneedjesuslol,0

human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as¬†fertilization¬†(conception).
""fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a¬†sperm¬†(spermatozoon) with a¬†secondary oocyte¬†(ovum) and ends with the fusion of their¬†pronuclei¬†(the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. this fertilized ovum, known as a¬†zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or¬†primordium, of a human being.""

the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the¬†spermatozoon¬†from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the¬†zygote.""

the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""

[larsen, william j.¬†human embryology. 2nd edition. new york: churchill livingstone, 1997, p. 17]

although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the¬†zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""

it's insane to think that you can retire off dividends from gmx. if you were making that money off 100% apple stock, you would be nuts to think you should retire on that, but putting all your eggs in gmx is next-level stupid.

if you were making enough to live off from a well-diversified portfolio, all power to you. but you're not. have you not heard how many of these companies go insolvent? how many rug pulls there are?

i bought at ~3 &amp; sold at 11 because my buddies scared me. could have have sold it at 18-19.

how good the service is and profitability may not reflect the demand of the stocks among retain investors.

i personally prefer growth stocks that will eventually get div less than a decade later. more interesting ang unrealized capital gains.

like if i bought $dito for $1m at 1.00/share then sold it at 18-19/share in 0.01/share increments then i'd have made at least $18.4m. does it matter if the mbps is that bad? i just want to make money.

- [1997 asian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_asian_financial_crisis), was not financially literate then
- [2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp), had me applying with e*trade for an online account to buy $aapl. i chickened on the paperwork

$aapl = $140

i had $30,621 from us compensation that would have bought me 10k shares. 

- portfolio worth $39.4m today
- yearly dividend high of $229.6k
- after stock splits i'd have 280k shares

if i combined my us compensation + ph savings i'd have $234,765 that would have bought me 76.7k shares. 

- portfolio worth $300.5m today
- yearly dividend high of $1.8m
- after stock splits i'd have 2.1m shares

the table above is only dividends. i didn't include today's closing stock price.

all i can say is $glo is a better investment than $tel. my guess is that the overhead of being such an old company hurts them.",0,,pink_fedora2000,0

if the rich parent and ideally the poor parent told me about the poor parent's struggles and the living situation of their siblings, cousins, their children and other poor relations and friends and as to why they were poor i would have done better.

""i'll let you in on a secret. the term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by ivf practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. the new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients.

now you can say that it's a human life but not a person, and thus doesn't have rights. that's a sensible position, though one i disagree with. but to say it isn't a human life is just wrong as a matter of fact.

[human biology](https://bio.libretexts.org/bookshelves/human_biology/book%3a_human_biology_(wakim_and_grewal)/23%3a_human_growth_and_development/23.2%3a_germinal_stage) states that ""the germinal stage of development is the first and shortest of the stages of the human lifespan. the germinal stage lasts a total of eight to nine days. it begins in a fallopian tube when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm to form a zygote (day 0).""

those were just the textbooks that are available online and could be googled in 10minutes, but you can find the same fact stated in just about all textbooks on  biological human development. if you can find a textbook that says otherwise, please provide a source.¬†

1656201764,"&gt; use your deal making passion on real estate, buying **stocks**/businesses

when it comes to stocks, be really careful about this. i have hardcore frugal tendencies, and when this mindset crosses streams into my investing, i have to check myself.

1. most people know this, but the actual price of a share of stock is pretty meaningless. it's all about the market cap. for example, a share of amazon stock is $116.56. a share of target stock is $150.69. there's literally people out there that would think amazon stock is *cheaper* than target. but amazon's market cap is over 1 trillion dollars while target is like 70 billion. amazon, the company is worth like 15 times what target is worth. there's just way more outstanding shares of amzn stock compared to tgt. 

so, it's all about the market cap. of course, if you're only buying companies based on their market cap, you'll also get into serious trouble. you'll start buying crap companies just because their market cap is only 2 billion. there's a reason it's only 2 billion.

2. the other pitfall that you can find yourself in, from a stock investing standpoint, is that you'll refuse to buy anything unless it's at (or really closte to) it's 52 week low. now, this would be perfectly fine if you bought microsoft stock on june 14th. ($241.51 was the intraday low)

but, the chances of you being able to buy that stock, at that perfect time, is extremely slim. also, microsoft is a wonderful company that will be around for another decade at least. so, if you're lucky enough to scoop up microsoft on a 52 week low, congrats. now hold it for about 3 years and then buy yourself a brand new tesla with your profits.

the problem is, catching a super high-quality company at a 52 week low is incredibly rare. normally, it's crappy companies like robinhood and zillow that are hitting new 52 week lows every other week.

if you do mess with stocks, one simple rule of thumb to go by, don't invest any money in any company with a market cap of less than 125 billion. this will likely keep you out of trouble. you could still make a mistake and back something terrible, but you're a lot less likely to if you stick with companies above this threshold.",2,,IHadTacosYesterday,0
1656202823,"how ""layman"" is ""layman""? i'll shoot low, no insult intended, step over the bits you don't need.

if we can assume you've got a handle on variables, as being a named memory location?.

after that some languages have a concept of a ""struct"" or ""record"", which is a group of variables, in a defined order.

real world metaphors can be a bit too general for me ( yes, things are like other things! ), but if you've ever filled in a form on a piece of paper, a struct is the ""in memory equivalent"" ( so, i guess a pad of pre-printed forms is an array of structs.. and that slightly crunched up form with the coffee stain on it that slipped down the side of my desk is a memory leak?? ) metaphors are fun...

anyhoo, an object is a struct that also has code that knows how to operate on those variables ( or may indeed consist entirely or almost entirely of code ). to make that work, generally an oop language passes a special ""this"" ( or ""me"" if you prefer, but it's usually called ""this"" ) to those functions referring to the object instance who's code was called. so if o is my object, and i have 10 in an array, and i call o[3].f(), then when f starts, it's ""this"" reference points at o[3].

we don't have 10 copies of the code of course, the actual underlying struct will have pointers to the functions - which is to say you can do some of the very basic aspects of objects with just structs that have pointers to functions as some of their member fields.

so, an object type is a particular definition of variables and functions, and an instance of an object is a allocated memory region using that type to give it structure..

powershell, being based on c#, is one of those ""everything is an object"" languages.. so even the basic types like ""integer"" which might just refer to 2-8 bytes of memory in a simpler language, are themselves objects, with a list of functions that know how to operate on integers. try this:

$v=5
$v.gettype()
$v|get-member

it might seem overkill for an integer type, but as soon as we start talking anything more complicated, where changing the value might mean complex operations or even memory allocations, the first benifits of the encapsulation can be seen.

think of a date object for example, which will have a print or ""tostring()"" function that automatically converst from the internal storage format to whatever the current users locale settings say dates should look like. or better yet, if i have a date variable, and a time variable, and i want to add them together? a sane object system will provide methods so i can do something like $dateobj.add(timeobj).

alas, this does not allow us to add more hours to the day, again showing the weakness of metaphor, or perhaps the weakness of my sense of humour?.. or both!


while the ""struct with function pointers"" is, i believe, conceptually accurate, in an actual oop language the pointers to each object type are probably not stored with every instance, especially with basic types.. if you ran the $v code above, you see int's already have a lot of methods, which would make each int take up much much more memory than  its basic representation requires.  so a oop language, in knowing that an object is an int, can store that list of method pointers with it's definition of an int object. exactly if/how that happens in c#/powershell is beyond my knowledge.",4,,Awkward_Car_7089,0

hard forks for network upgrades happen all the time and a hard fork + snapshot can be used in the event a vulnerability of such a scale was found and abused. the immutability actually helps in this instance because the entire point of the chain is to be one huge backup of its entire state history and so the aforementioned backup and recovery is something that pretty much is already a solved problem. the only real potential damage is to the assets price but i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd see msft stock price fall if there was a huge windows vulnerability found tomorrow that effected the core os, prior versions and therefore legacy systems reliant on xp or some shit.

1656214804,"all this change will result in, that actually counts is msft stock increasing by several points.

stealing a comment from the other discussions - the business motives are pretty bog standard sadly:

u/jeweltk thank you for the server host perspective, i agree with all points as they come form a genuine position of concern and understanding. for compliment to this discussion, i share with you the business reality perspective: ^((i will be using microsoft in place of mojang, as they're who cover the financial and legal aspects of this ip))

* esrb - minecraft is marketed as appropriate for 10+
* despite the warning of: ""***caution: third-party online play*** *caution: online play is offered by third-party servers that are not owned, operated, or supervised by mojang studios or microsoft. during online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone.""* this does not absolve microsoft from cases such as adam isaac. [bbc link to article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-38691882)
* due to documented cases of malicious activities, the business is required to defend their actions in court. ""we warned them"" is not a defense that has succeeded in court in terms of child endangerment.
* in court, when the topic of 'knowledge' comes up - as opposed to legal suits of similar surrounding gta online, and battlefield/call of duty, microsft has extremely higher guidelines to meet as they market the game to minors. (vs, with the aforementioned examples, minors claiming suit are dismissed due to their falsifying of information to gain access to age restricted material).
* this ideology has been made public in recent cases of restriction of action, and scrutiny of inaction in cases on multiple social media platforms (ex. ""x group is now to recruit using z platform. z platform is now issued summons to explain their fostering of x group"")
* optional oversight, due to these unfortunate (yes rare) cases, is not possible for the legal reason of, ""microsoft knew the issue of predidation existed in their game, and cut off children's access to aid. instead allowing the owner of a illicit group to determine what was/wasn't appropriate.""
* *financially - there is an incentive of global bans is to increase sales numbers, and quarterly profits.* this is well documented and practiced in the digital industry as *a subsidiary source of income for non-subscription based* customers. (i.e. the theme park model. we charge at the gate, but everyone is forced home. they have to pay to return.)
* developmentally - there is an incentive to remove older users/accounts. when banning users, the older members are more likely to be removed than newer accounts due to volume of previous interactions. legacy users carry with them expectations that hamper progress (here being known in terms of 'opposition to change in financial systems' examples such as subscriptions, micro-transactions, paid skins, paid maps, latency reduction, priority, etc.)  in short - consistent users who don't buy, are less useful to microsoft than new users who buy and accept. because new users, accept the game as it is, not as 'it should be'.
* it matters not what our customers want, it only matters what the court will decide.
* ""a customer who doesn't pay, doesn't have a voice."" ""a customer doesn't make a sound till the exchange funds.""

sadly - these are the main driving points of issues like these. for pr - this is always pushed as ""protection of minors"" - such as to appeal to groups like parentstogether. and with that, they're able to push these oversight onto users without legal restriction because, as shown above, 'warning players' doesn't absolve microsoft from legal repercussions. and again, there's clear financial incentive to new sales through banned users.

this is the by-product of a multi-billion dollar game, with millions of daily users. we are the few, were are the silent (because we don't keep paying microsoft), and when we're gone, by choice or force, there are tens of thousands willing and able to replace us. and best of all for microsoft, those replacements will keep paying.

p.s. ""but our community is what makes the game."" *made* the game. minecraft is self sufficient now. want proof? ""embrace"" - they took suggestions form reddit and mods. ""extend"" they encouraged sharing ideas and gave a new platform for new suggestions on their own site, ""extinguish"" now microsoft only acknowledges suggestions, through their official suggestion box, and only after suggestions have passed their moderation.

sad but true. you and i, and the minority market share of java players - don't made enough impact to change the course of the game. case and point, even if hermitcraft stopped playing, bedrock sales alone would perpetuate...as they have been in this decade old game.

higher interest rates. many people try to buy ‚Äúas much house as the bank will approve‚Äù. buyers who can afford 700k at 2% can only afford 500k at 6%. don‚Äôt fight the fed. demand üìâ

volatility. what goes up, must come down. homes doubled in value in many places in just 2 years. we just saw the most rapid rise in prices ever, but wage/population growth doesn't support it. in fact, median sales price was on a slight decline in 2018/19. what changed? the pandemic caused an unnatural supply shortage along with weird migration patterns. it‚Äôs rare for a stable commodity to skyrocket in price and then flatten. it almost always corrects downward. supply üìà

no mo‚Äô fomo. the fomo buyer is endangered. a record 80% of people on the fannie mae nhs survey say it‚Äôs a bad time to buy. demand üìâ

price to earnings. home values are not staying aligned with incomes. price to earnings ratio is at an all time high. last time it got this bad, prices crashed. https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-income-ratio/ demand üìâ

prices can only go up. they have to. without rising prices, flippers can‚Äôt flip, landlords can‚Äôt leverage infinite units to purchase, regular people can‚Äôt cash out equity to buy suvs. in the last crash, the majority of foreclosures were well-qualified prime borrowers that ended up underwater and just gave up. if prices go down, even by 10% or 15%, the bottom will fall out and take down the entire house of cards with it. supply üìà

tech slowdown. tech provides many of the high-paying remote jobs that allow people to drive up prices in remote places like prescott, az. almost all tech stocks are way down from feb highs and many have started hiring freezes and layoffs - some of these companies will not survive. i work in tech, vcs are telling cash burning startups to cut costs now or they‚Äôll fail to raise in the future. demand üìâ

shadow inventory. holding an empty home is expensive. even with renters, profit margins are thin and many operate in the red. it‚Äôs all good though because prices go up 20% every year. if prices start going down, investors will not be able to hold these properties indefinitely. supply üìà

back to the office. managers are desperate to get workers back to the office. elon recently changed the narrative on remote work which could embolden managers to be less flexible. this could take some pressure off mini boom towns, i.e. coeur d'alene. demand üìâ

airbnb oversaturation. consumer savings are eroding quickly. gas is up. travel is one of the first expenses people cut. people are starting to hate airbnbs for the high pricing and ridiculous cleaning fees. these will become money pits for many in a recession. supply üìà

race for the exits. sellers sense a change. price cuts have increased dramatically, yet many houses continue to sit. prices will have to be cut further if inventory keeps rising. supply üìà

for base salary, at faang. you will be a mid level or possibly senior engineer. based on your question i might lean mid level but you can send me your linkedin and i can give a better estimate if you want. so mid level is google l4 and right now you would be looking at 150k base to $190k base. this is faang so at a smaller less known company, you might see an inflated title and $130 to $170k base.

‚Äúabstract: the predominance of human biological research confirms that human life begins at conception‚Äîfertilization.‚Äù

ouch! 

‚Äúhuman development is a continuous process that begins when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (or spermatozoon) from a male. (p. 2); ‚Ä¶ but the embryo begins to develop as soon as the oocyte is fertilized. (p. 2); ‚Ä¶ human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ‚Ä¶ unites with a female gamete or oocyte ‚Ä¶ to form a single cell. this higly specialized, titipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.

1656346068,"no more than the usual regret for taking up a hobby. finally sold my closet full of mtg from the 90's last year and thought about doing the math on dollars spent but decided it wasn't worth worrying about because i enjoyed the hell out of those cards for many years. 

did i spend too much on mtg and ffrk over the years? yup. could i have done something more ""responsible"" or ""better"" with it? yup. (see also price of apple stock in 199 for one!) 

do i regret that a little? sure. but, unlike fry, i refuse to rue or lament hobbies that i can afford (or in the case of mtg that my parent's allowance could afford)!

1656349959,"&gt;it promises that the influx of new people will increase the economy overall, 

lol. do you understand you also described a ponzi scheme. i think maybe you get this. if you are ""smart"" you will realize that this is not a game designed for you, so just put your money on an indexed stock fund and don't play. however -- how can something as big as ss ""just"" invest in the top 10% of stocks? then of course, those stocks would be over-valued. so, really, it has to be all stocks otherwise it's overvaluing -- and then the returns aren't that great -- and of course, the ""smart money"" would leave as the ss came in -- taking the profits with them. the ""average"" will look great, but then the ""bureuacrats in government"" will get blamed that ss has such poor performance. ""why, anyone at x broker service could do better."" right, because they aren't stuck being most of the market.

there are companies valued 100x and more times earnings. that's because everyone puts their money in the stock market -- because that's just what you do. there's no possible way it is worth its valuation -- these are just symbolic gambling chips. so, as soon as ""smart money"" has a better investment, a big share of it can evaporate and leave the dumb money holding the bag. historically -- you can look and see that if you just ""hold on"" you will do well. but, these are averages -- and not noticing that the smart money has a different result than the diamond hands dumb investors -- the suckers who keep buying because they see ""hurr durr, stocks grow."" for every apple stock there are 100 bad stocks.

&gt;""that being said, i do invest into the stock market, because i simply don't see anything else, ""

yeah, and that's the reality. other than ""investing"" in a small business idea, or your own education -- there aren't a lot of ""sure things."" and really -- how could there be? how does something sit there and get more value doing nothing? it can't.

the smart money now is buying up property to create scarcity. in fact -- not meeting full demand, if you can control a market, is really where the best profit is at and the ""new game"" is these ""too big to fail"" mega-corps. i don't know if we have a name for the controlling ownership of a group of people such that they own a lot of companies without it looking like they do. the term ""interlocking directorates"" just doesn't really get the image across -- but, it's a vast spiderweb of ownership.

watch as the ""inflation"" we now know is not connected to ""record profits"" on wall street. and there will be renewed pressure to privatize ""entitlements"" so they can take the last jewels of america worth stealing. funny that republicans get treated as the solution to the policies they pushed that caused the problem - would it have something to do with the media being the same as the stock market?",7,,Fake_William_Shatner,0

1656373635,"that is something that is literally only alive and has human dna, regardless of whether or not it is unique. stem cells in adults have different dna depending on their role but the base dna is that of the person. the only characteristics at fertilization that a zygote has(which is what its called after fertilization if you read the quotes) is that it is alive and has human dna. 

from your own quote btw:

""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""
[jonathan van blerkom of university of colorado, expert witness on human embryology before the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 63]

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the¬†zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
[o'rahilly, ronan and mÔøΩller, fabiola.¬†human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. this textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}]

zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr.¬†zyg tos, yoked together), represents the¬†beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n.¬†before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1]

""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[considine, douglas (ed.).¬†van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943]

so at fertilization it is a zygote. its characteristics include only being alive and consisting of human dna. thats not debated by science. science also says that life is continuous. being human and being alive is not synonymous with personhood or being a human being. and the definition of human is as follows btw.

""relating to or characteristic of people or human beings.

1656449685,"nope - just the market for digital tokens.

most markets are for tangible goods, warrants for tangible goods, and/or warrants for equity/debt in operations that have a going concern (and most likely generate profits, or at least some sort of cashflows).

whereas my ownership of a home, apple stock, or jp morgan debt gives me the right to either tangible property or a contract promising equity or cash (e.g, interest, coupon payments, dividends, etc.) the entire market for digital tokens relies upon existing owners of what is essentially worthless code selling to new owners for (ever) rising prices, and the the ‚Äúpyramid scheme‚Äù only works if there are people more foolish than current hodlers willing to buy said tokens with the expectation that the price appreciates (they fill the bottom of the pyramid).

once you‚Äôre out of fools, the market collapses, and that is what we‚Äôve been witnessing for the last few weeks.

this is only true for asset bubbles for goods with little to no inherent value (like digital tokens or tulips in 17th century netherlands).

while other markets can certainly be volatile and subject to irrational exuberance, destructive speculation, fraud, and severe crashes, they are ultimately built on the exchange of tangible goods and services; the market for digital tokens is built on nothing more than hyperbole (and likely illegal market manipulation by whales and other shills with conflicts of interest).

i‚Äôd recommend depositing your cash into a federally insured bank to generate guaranteed interest, or continuing to learn about markets before investing in unregulated markets like those for digital tokens. many of the regulated equity and debt markets are volatile right now, but they will be here long after the digital coins go to near zero prices, as they most likely will once the hype around ‚Äúblockchain technology‚Äù softens, and once sovereign governments develop and release their own tokens that are fully backed by state power (and banking deposits).",-1,,Bromari,0

1656451540,"its cash flows aren't accurate either.

its biggest issue is stock based compensation (sbc). it gives out a huge amount of options employees every year, and buys back a huge amount of shares to cover those options and prevent dilution. 

reported earnings deduct estimated sbc, using black scholes to estimate the cost. but because fb stock price has gone up almost every year, the estimated sbc is almost always lower than the actual cost in buybacks. 

examples from 2021:

net earnings: $39.4b, fcf: $39b

sbc: $9.2b, buybacks: $44.5b

starting shares: 2,888m, ending shares: 2,859m

if you look at fcf like an owner, you'd at a minimum deduct sbc from it. you can pay employees with cash, or with stock, but if you need to incorporate the cost of the stock as if it was cash. so conservatively actual owner free cash flow is only $30m.

but wait, it gets much worse. sbc is wildly lower than actual buyback cost. now some of that buyback cost reduced share count by 29m shares. at current share prices that's worth $4.9b, but the stock traded about double that last year so lets use $10b to estimate 2021 cost. 

that means covering employee options cost $34.5b last year. which means actual earnings and free cash flow were only $5b. thats a massive discrepancy in reported vs. actual owner earnings.

now this year since fb is declining that relationship should reverse. black scholes will likely overestimate the value of the option grants given out this year. but guess what, it's not gonna be $34b difference, it's going to be five or ten billion tops.

&gt;
&gt;o pcp afirma a sua solidariedade com a luta dos trabalhadores de um sector cujo sal√°rio continua a ser, na generalidade das empresas, ao n√≠vel do sal√°rio m√≠nimo nacional, fruto do ataque da associa√ß√£o patronal ao contrato colectivo de trabalho.
&gt;
&gt;nesta iniciativa, integrada na ac√ß√£o nacional de luta promovida pela cgtp-in, ficou muito viva a den√∫ncia de que o sector t√™xtil √© um bom exemplo do impacto da caducidade da contrata√ß√£o colectiva, que os sucessivos governos ps, psd e cds insistem em n√£o revogar, no ataque aos direitos e da necessidade do aumento geral dos sal√°rios, e do smn para 850‚Ç¨, objectivos pelos quais o pcp se continuar√° a bater.

if this is in an ira, have you considered putting it in vtsax (which you already hold)? currently, aapl holdings makes up roughly 6% of vtsax. if you have a sentimental attachment to holding it, then fine. it is not nearly as bad as many decisions and suggestions i see posted online daily. but if you want more diversity and a long-term strategy, i follow the belief it is better to invest in a fund that captures the broader market (thousands of companies) as opposed to one or two individual picks. you run a greater risk of underperforming the broader market when you pick individual stocks.

1656529407,"&gt;i look at, for example, vti and after adding 20% for inflation it's priced equivalently to where it was back in dec 2019.

i've never heard anyone try and value stocks like that, it makes no sense. so you're assuming earnings of companies have gone up 20% since dec 2019? inflation has mostly been from energy costs (oil etc). why would you apply the price of oil going up to apple stock going up? 

i'm referring to the common ways to measure valuations like the [cape ](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) or [standard pe](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) or [buffet indicator](https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php) etc...",1,,honkballs,0
1656529609,"yes, but buying an apple stock for $1000 doesn't actually give apple any money, because they don't have any outstanding shares that they own and are trying to sell. when you buy a stock, you're buying it from some other person (probably corporation) who wants to sell theirs. the stocks are sold during an ipo by apple to random people, then they're traded among the other people until apple does a stock buyback. so buying apple stock at a price only helps apple in the sense that people's wanting to buy their stock at that price keeps their stock value high, making more valuable all the stock in themselves that apple does still own.

in addition to your point about voting, owning apple stock also means that now apple will owe you dividends, so they'll actually be paying you now. i think realistically your one apple share isn't going to give you much voting leverage, but it's theoretically there.

in contrast, buying an apple product is directly giving apple money. but yeah, neither option feels morally great.",1,,halberdierbowman,0

1656538393,"some interesting aspects of ether/eum that just don't exist with any other assets:

1) there's a community built around the asset that will always be buying. this community grows every year, partially b/c there's a huge demographic tailwind behind it. in any case, the recurring buys will continue and they will continue to grow. forget new money, it's the community around the asset that matters the most, especially in hard times. the community is strong, and there's no other community like it. layer 0 around an asset is an investment merit of ethereum that sadly goes unnoticed but it's extremely, extremely strong. i think the only other community that might, might come close to this level of fandom is possibly bitcoin and tsla stock.  

2) ethereum can be stolen but it powers major applications. say, there's a big hack on a bridge or something. well, someones gotta buy that eth to replace all the stolen eth. like, apple stock can't get stolen, but it also can't be used for anything. this is due to eth's property of having utility, as well as trustless asset. 

3) lastly, i'll say something which probably most of you already know here. eth is a special asset that isn't only profitable (after merge), it's a hard money, but it's also a consumption asset. i don't know any other assets that are all 3 and eth is the only one in the world.

&amp;#x200b;

buying an etf isn't buying bitcoin and having the government hold it lol. for example, if i buy a popular etf like vti, i'm not buying 10,000 stocks and asking the government to hold them for me, i'm buying an investment product that holds those 10,000 stocks. i can sell the investment product, vti anytime i want, but i can't sell the underlying apple stocks that the etf product holds.

&amp;#x200b;

they're both for fully different purposes. there's lots of reasons one might own both vti and actual apple shares, even though vti has the apple stock ticker in it.

&amp;#x200b;

same thing with bitcoin. if there is a bitcoin etf and i can allocate some of my 401k or hsa money to it, that would be nice! because i certainly can't go on an exchange and buy btc itself for my hsa.

sure apple did a release like they said with the iphone, but did the apple stock then explode? nope. took years to climb up, so it doesn't even make sense to give apple as an example of releasing something and the stock exploding up cause that didn't happen! 


yet here the expectation is that a similar style announcement by gme will make the stock explode. just cause we believe in it, an announcement doesn't mean the rest of the world will believe in the future of the marketplace. it still has to prove itself just like apple and the iphone had to prove themselves.

1656611001,"i am not so ‚Äúyoung‚Äù as you might be thinking! i am 32, and it actually took me a *really long time* to learn how to stand up for myself, due to said trauma! 

the story i am about to tell you is real, raw, and ugly enough for me to put a ‚Äútrigger warning for $v!c!dal ideation.‚Äù (i don‚Äôt want to trigger a damned bot!) 

here‚Äôs my story: 

1) i went to 16-p when i was 17, got enfp, and b/c of this, i actually *thought* i was an enfp for 15 years! so i just accepted that ‚Äúi wasn‚Äôt really logical‚Äù as a fact of life, and took it for what it was. 

the thing is, i was definitely always *extremely reasonable,* i just didn‚Äôt know how to stand up for myself, yet. 

1) when i started taking newer type tests, and i started reading about the cognitive functions, and processes, i found out ‚Äúwell damn! i am actually an entp, and i favor the ti-fe axis. that makes a weird kind of sense, actually!‚Äù 

i simply have an overactive tert fe thanks to trauma. 

1) that‚Äôs why when i tried to make ‚Äòvalue based-decisions,‚Äô i f0cked up, and miscalculated, sometimes hilariously, while other times, it nearly ruined my life! 

2) it‚Äôs b/c i was suppressing my *true* ‚Äúauxiliary ti.‚Äù i told myself that ‚Äúi am wrong,‚Äù on the regular, cuz i believed that i ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt logical!‚Äù 

during childhood, recognizing ne-fe, and having *unnaturally high fe, and extreme empathy* was a literal ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù for dealing with my parents, who were both *extremely unhealthy feelers!* 

1) mom is *most likely* an esfx, while my dad was most likely an infx. 

1) i *essentially* had to ‚Äúpretend to be an enfp, or an infj.‚Äù 

2) only ne was allowed to ‚Äúexist‚Äù in my conscious mind, in its ‚Äúnatural state,‚Äù and only when i was away from them, and with other people. 

3) this left my auxiliary ti, *nearly untouched.* as ne + inf si ‚Äúpassively but objectively recorded, *everything* ‚Äúin vivid detail.‚Äù fi ‚Äúencoded‚Äù all of these memories, due to the emotions i never expressed, and it became the key to the proverbial ‚Äúpandora‚Äôs box‚Äù which housed the true nature of my psyche. 

ne-si recorded, and stored the ‚Äúobjective truth‚Äù of my upbringing, in intensely vivid detail! 

1) only fi ‚Äúheld the key,‚Äù thusly leading to many unhealthy behaviors, and decisions on my part when i was young *based on the fact* that i *believed* that fi was my ‚Äúauxiliary function, so it knew what was right for me!‚Äù except, that was a lie! 

so those unhealthy patterns of behavior became a regular part of my life. 

1) in those earlier years of our marriage, i actually deferred to my intj husband‚Äôs judgment for everything b/c, in my brain, he was *supposed to be the logical one!* 

2) the thing is, i came to find that while he was ‚Äúright‚Äù about several things, he was often too hasty when ‚Äúpassing judgement!‚Äù 

3) and i *knew better!* ti still ‚Äúrecognized the patterns, analyzed them, in depth,‚Äù and it knew ‚Äúwhich way the wind was *probably going to blow!* 

4) however, i had convinced myself that ‚Äúhe was the logical one who knows better, cuz he is logical,‚Äù and my instincts were ‚Äúnot to be trusted because i was the emotional one!‚Äù

once i realized my *true nature,* and outgrew that ‚Äútendency to doubt myself,‚Äù things started to change, for the better, rapidly! 

1) i was like a whole new wiser person, and my husband was like. üôÄ ‚Äúwho is this woman??‚Äù (in a good way!) 

my ti growth *exploded* within literal weeks! 

1) this function i had so long suppressed, reduced, and ignored, it changed my life, because it started behaving the way it was supposed to! 

2) i suddenly saw how incredibly different fi, and fe *actually are!* it exposed my husband‚Äôs tert fi ‚Äúsoftspot,‚Äù and i saw him in a whole new way, too! 

4) he was no longer an infallible ‚Äúlogic machine.‚Äù he‚Äôs quite sensitive, too and just as capable of being ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù as me!

all of this opened my eyes, bringing awareness to how damaged i really was, and how complex ptsd was a ticking time bomb in the background of my mind.

it, quite literally, killed my late father, and a late great uncle who was a vietnam war vet. 

1) so sometimes, learning how to ‚Äúspeak our truth‚Äù becomes a matter of ‚Äúlife, and death!‚Äù 

2) thusly, never again will i try to censor another human being for the sake of my ego! 

the drawback was that i learned that i spent so much time *not believing in myself,* that when i started ‚Äúspeaking my truth,‚Äù i saw how *unintentionally cold, and unflinchingly honest* ti could be, when not ‚Äútempered.‚Äù 

1) i saw how *accidentally brutal* it could be! cuz i occasionally hurt my partner‚Äôs feelings too, and obviously i felt terrible about it! 

2) i wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù i just didn‚Äôt know how to communicate efficiently! 

so i have been in the process of completely getting to know myself, again, and learning how to speak to others, essentially from scratch! 

1) i have been *lucky* because my partner has been very patient, thusly i extend the same patience, and consideration to him, because we are both *simply learning!* 

2) i would *never* want my husband to feel like he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt talk to me,‚Äù as i know what that feels like, all too well! 

there was one particularly bad night, accompanied by a ‚Äúflashback episode.‚Äù i said ‚Äúif it wasn‚Äôt for the other people in my life, &amp; my desire to not cause them pain, and suffering, i would be dead! i would‚Äôve k!ll&amp;d myself years ago!‚Äù 

and what truly shook me to my core, and ‚Äúscared me straight,‚Äù was the fact that i *knew it to be true,* as my middle little sister tried to off herself, and had to be institutionalized 2-3 times, after our dad passed away. now, she is a completely different (and pretty awful) person! 

1) i need only think of my dad, who k!ll3d himself, by accident, and my great uncle who did it on purpose! 

2) learning how to speak our truth is soooooooooo urgent, that we will k!ll ourselves if we don‚Äôt learn how to do it properly! it becomes vital to our survival! 

ironically until i met that very istp friend whom i quoted in my last comment, i was *completely asleep,* in my life. 

1) so, i watched him closely, even though he is younger than me, and i began to learn from him! 

those 2 men my intj husband, my newer presumed istp friend, and my willingness to accept, and speak ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù it all saved my life!

i did not grow up in an environment that was conducive to the necessary, and healthy development of my auxiliary ti, and it‚Äôs usage. 

so perhaps this sounds like ‚Äúyounger you,‚Äù but how old are you?

against the advice of the accountant, he took out a large heloc and plowed all of it into aapl. this was around 2015 or so. apple stock doubled. then, in the depths of the covid crash, he took out a margin loan, and plowed all that money right back in and bought more aapl around the bottom of 2020. apple stock doubled.

vr has so many more use cases than just gaming.  we haven't even begun to scratch the surface. as soon as we are able to meet needs and solve problems that increase productivity or decrease frustration in current systems, then it will eventually be disruptive. 

vr technology and augmented reality technology will certainly not fail, it will only grow as use cases continue to immerge. the train has left the station and will only grow speed with time.   meta specifically, will not fail, for the simple fact of first mover advantage  and branding and marketing.  üëè  they also have the massive advantage of being one of the largest companies in the world with tons of power to move fast. 

i do agree however, that the current bulky system is not going to work....and improving is absolutely assential...but the potential is massive. 

if you remember the first nintendo and compare it to now.....that is where we are with this completely new device, what is coming in the future will be amazing.

the gaming aspect of vr is just a small part of its potential. 

in my personal experience....meta has given us something that is just wow enough to show that we could really have something here. 

i personally can't wait to see how this evolves. 

that being said i am not gonna invest so much right now in the current model and what it currently offers....but down the road i will definitely be saying take my money!

i am a buyer of meta stock though!!! for many reasons not just vr or metaverse but definitely see that being a major asset in the future and potentially one of the greatest financial investment opportunities in our world today.",1,,AustinAbbyDaddy1111,0

1656620393,"true... but also not information anyone can/will likely be making primary residence mortgage decisions based upon.

a day or week long blip does not a months long trend make. rates overall are still trending upwards if you zoom out to any months-long scale (with this week's improvements, and the june 15 one-day improvement, rates are merely back to, but not better than, where they were at on june 10... this means if you were preapproved in early june, you will simply get the rate ballpark *that you expected*, rather than feeling bait-and-switched when your loan officer offers to lock you at a *higher* rate than you expected). that could change in a month, who knows, but for the time being that's what we actually non-speculatively know.

here's why no one can or will act on, or do anything with, this information \~\~

purchase transactions:

* trying to time preapproval is pointless. your house hunt, before you go into contract, could be a week long or 6 months long. it overall still remains true that whatever rate i ""quote"" someone today when they start their house hunt, what we lock will be higher (inclusive of 60 or 90 or 120 day ""lock n shop"" locks, which are always priced worse as the counter-hedge, baking in 'expected' or 'anticipated' future rate increases).
* the buyer does not control when the seller will accept the offer and ratify the contract. the seller does. so you can't time this down to the day. if you go writing that stronger offer based on the marginally lower rates, it could take 3 days to respond, by which point rates have gone right back up (as has happened significantly more than 50% of the time in the last couple months).
* in an overall rising rate environment, literally every mortgage professional i know is advising folks to lock as soon as they are in contract. it's a very brave soul, right now, who floats the rate for days/weeks in an attempt to day-trade the mortgage on their house, rather than locking right away. your purchase contract specifies a close of escrow, so the window with which you theoretically have to day trade in has a set time limit.

refinance transactions:

* those people refinancing right now are not motivated by rates. they're one party to a divorcing couple, motivated by the court's order to ""refi or sell 123 banana st by such-and-such date"" and similar. with that set deadline in place, it's similarly a very brave soul right now who is risking the entire house, in an attempt to wait for rates to come down, by that specified court ordered due date. similar things are in play for almost everyone refinancing right now, rate-motivated refinancers either got their jollies off in 2020/2021, or they're going to wait for the next global catastrophe (2008 and 2020 being examples).

it'll be formally announced that we are in recession within a couple days (2 consecutive quarters of gdp decline being the formal definition of a recession, today being the last day of the 2nd quarter of 2022, and q1 having a gdp decline is already known by all, so the 2nd of 2 boxes being checked is formally wrapping up as we speak, formal announcement pending, but we all already know exactly what that formal announcement is going to say, do we not?). i suspect the rate improvements of this week are merely in anticipation of that formal announcement of what we already all know. just like the week before a previously scheduled/announced fed rate hike, rates start to go up ***ahead of time*** in anticipation... i think that's all we are seeing, in reverse. if a cnn article says ""microsoft is about to post their best/worst quarterly earnings statement ever!"" then microsoft stock instantly starts to go up/down, it doesn't wait for the formal announcement, the cnn article is good enough for people to make trades on, and they do, same thing here.",-1,,aardy,0

a to sto je npr. $docu bio 314, a sad 57, ili $meta bila 384.33 to ne znaci da ce ponovo da ide po toj ceni. 

druga vrsta price anchoring-a je psiholoska, ali za tako nesto volatilno kao nio bilo kakav price anchoring koji nije od strane informisanog kupca nema nikakvog smisla.",5,,AdamovicM,0
