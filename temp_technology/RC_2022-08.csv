from nvidia stock dividend faq:

appendix for stockholders in poland
if you are an individual stockholder subject to tax in poland, the stock split in the form of a stock 
dividend may result in a taxable event. 
there is a risk that the tax authorities may both (1) view the stock dividend as taxable when it is 
issued to effect the stock split and (2) disregard the economic neutrality of the stock split, such 
that the original cost basis of the shares cannot be allocated on a pro rata basis.
nvidia is not able to provide you with tax advice. you should consult with your own personal 
tax advisor to determine whether any taxes are due in connection with the stock split and the 
impact of the stock split on the cost basis of your shares.

appendix for stockholders in switzerland
if you are an individual stockholder subject to tax in switzerland, the stock split in the form of a 
stock dividend may result in a taxable event. 
swiss individual income tax rules follow the so-called modified par value-principle. as a result, 
the stock dividend shares par value may be treated as taxable dividend income when received. 
in this case, stockholders who receive three additional shares for each share they hold, at a par 
value of $0.001 per share, may recognize taxable income in the amount of the par value of the 
new post-split shares.",48,,djsneak666,0

if you just want logical grouping, use { and } - it's also lower overhead when that's exactly and only what you want/need.

but note that the syntax is also a bit different - the ( and ) characters are special to the shell and recognized as such, whereas { and } aren't special characters, but rather reserved words, and rather are seen and recognized/parsed like most any other command.

so,

(foo;bar) runs foo and bar commands in a subshell,

whereas { foo; bar; } does logical grouping, but doesn't run them in a (separate) subshell.

1659451898,"for me, i often have a target delta in mind when getting in. as the underlying moves, any delta from options may change. 

i may go in and want to be near delta neutral, or net long, or net short. 

to give an example, say i do a covered call on apple. in the example, i buy 100 shares and sell a 20 delta call one month out. this initial position is equivalent to being long 80 shares. 

if apple stock goes down, the delta on the out of the money call goes down. i might roll the call down and out to stay near the initial 80 delta. 

if instead, apple rallies i might roll the sold call out and up to maintain roughly 80 delta. micro adjustments tend to be counter productive for retail traders. 

overall delta on different underlyings tends to be best calculated with spy beta weight. thinkorswim provides this number. in essence it takes a snapshot of the entire portfolio and equates it to a number of spy shares, net long or short or perhaps near neutral. 

the beta weight gives a rough idea of risk. if trading very short term options, gamma risk can be significant. gamma measures the change in delta.

about 85% of apple revenue is hardware sales which is unique among big tech and actually closer to amazon than google.  2021 was a massively successful year for apple due to stimmy (increased revenue of 33% yoy with iphones up 42% yoy) compared to much smaller increases previous years (10-20%).  in fact, iphone sales, the main driver, were actually declining prior to the pandemic.  all the new iphones purchased in 2021 will likely dampen sales for next generation as iphones do not need to be replaced every year.

additonally, q3 is already a low sales quarter due to anticipation of new iphone release next quarter.  however,  this could actually mitigate a drop in sales this quarter as management could dismiss it as people just waiting for the new iphone generation.  

altogether, i think aapl is overvalued and primed for correction, especially since it has fallen the least among big tech. basically, apple is the biggest pandemic stock but hasn't yet come back to earth like zoom or peleton or amazon.  it is still priced like its 2021 performance will continue, but i think that is unlikely to be the case.  however,  that doesn't necessarily mean that this theory will be realized in this earnings report.  

other factors pointing to a big miss;

-currency exchange rate (negative impact for approx 33% of revenue (europe and japan)

-china lockdowns and disturbances

factors against a big miss:

apple consumer typically wealthy and less impacted by inflation 

apple hasn't provides guidance, so bad guidance can't provide a negative shock.

apple stock has cult status and it will be hard to drop unless the failure is very obvious

positions:
i plan to open apple leap puts today.  i'm prepared to hold and add to the position over the next couple months if aapl goes up",2,,DarklyAdonic,0
1659470005,"pretty sure this is false.

**counterexample.** let $h=-i\\partial\_x$, acting on $h\^1(\\mathbb{r}) \\subsetneq l\^2(\\mathbb{r})$. this is an (unbounded) self-adjoint operator. $u(t)=\\exp(ith)$ is the translation operator $(u(t)f)(x)=f(x+t)$. thus, for any $f\\in l\^2(\\mathbb{r})$, $\\lim\_{t\\to\\infty} \\lvert u(t)f - f \\rvert\_{l\^2}\^2 = 2 \\lvert f \\rvert\_{l\^2}\^2$.

you can also cook up a counter-example using the usual schrodinger hamiltonian $h=-\\partial\_x\^2$. say, a dispersing (and/or translating) wavepacket [\[video link\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icjzm6nhzek), which is an exercise in most intro qm courses.

what is true (and what the argument in the video shows) is:

**proposition.** *if $h$ is a self-adjoint operator on a hilbert space $\\mathcal{h}$ \*and $\\psi\\in \\mathcal{h}$ is orthogonal to the continuous spectrum of h\* then, for any $\\epsilon&gt;0$, there exist a $t=t(\\psi)$ arbitrarily large such that $\\lvert u(t)\\psi - \\psi \\rvert &lt; \\epsilon$.*

physicists often act like all of their hamiltonians have pure point spectrum. usually this is a harmless abuse of notation, but here it actually matters. in the counterexamples above, the spectrum is absolutely continuous. this is actually typical in qm. for example, if our hamiltonian is the schrodinger hamiltonian $h=\\triangle+v$ and $v$ is a reasonable decaying potential, then the spectrum of $h$ consists of the nonnegative real axis and finitely many eigenvalues. (if $v$ is coulombic, we can have an infinite discrete set of eigenvalues. either way, we have a whole half-axis worth of spectrum.)

ps. the sho is one of the few infinite dimensional examples from introductory qm where there is no continuous spectrum. this has to do with the fact that the potential is growing rapidly at infinity (ergo *not* decaying).",2,,21493760,0

1659479915,"&gt;\[t\]he spectrum would always be discrete until we extended the volume to infinite or approached the thermodynamic limit. your comment with this being ""typical"" is making me question my intuition.

i don't know a counterexample to this. however, most introductory qm is done in the setting of infinite (or at least very large) volume. (exceptions include the infinite square well.) you might say we can always pretend like our potential is infinite outside of some compact region, but this has its own problems, the most important of which is that we cannot do scattering theory (or discuss things like the dispersion of wavepackets). scattering theory, which is intimately connected to the existence of continuous spectrum (and on which many of the most famous predictions of qft are based), only makes sense if we are working in the infinite volume limit.

ps. if you care about solid state physics, then one of the most important concepts is that of a band, which is an interval's worth of continuous spectrum. the mathematical model here is the schrodinger equation with a periodic potential. if you confine everything to finite volume, you no longer get bands.

pps. if you approximate a potential by another potential that is infinite outside of some finite region, then the resultant approximated unitary evolution will fail to be accurate at large time. but large time is precisely the regime relevant to poincar\\'e recurrence, so i don't see any way to salvage the result at the level of empirical predictions.

ppps. in fact, i can basically guarantee that there are no counterexamples in finite volume. the reason is that $\\triangle+v$ has a discrete spectrum on any riemannian manifold \[theorem of weyl?\] (for $v$ reasonable).",2,,21493760,0

1659481043,"the ""market value"" of something is just a middleground established by a middleground of buyers and sellers. things like gold, wheat, and apple stock shares are all basically identical, but even with those things there are buyers who go that high and sellers who won't go that low. things like toilet paper may vary in quality, but it's all still comparable.

there are multiple factors that muddy the waters when it comes to houses, making it hard to predict market value and even harder to predict actual value:

1. **they are not identical.** even in a brand-new cookie cutter housing development, the house next to the smelly sewer should probably sell for a bit less than the other ""identical"" houses. although, let's be honest, the construction crew probably changed 3 times and was drunk on fridays, so the houses probably vary in quality quite a lot. the differences only grow once you start to factor in location, age, level of neglect/maintenance by previous owners, renovations (good or bad), etc.
2. **they are not sold often**. if only 5 comparable houses have sold in a given neighborhood this year, then sales history is based on far fewer data points compared to, for example, stock in general motors.
3. **their value is subjective.** this is true of anything, but it's probably worst for houses, which are deeply personal in a way that a lot of other things you can purchase aren't. one person's dream home is another person's torture chamber.
4. **marketing**. marketing is used to distort buyer perception of value. again, this applies to everything, but housing is unusual in that ***every individual house*** gets its own marketing. most home sellers spend like 5% of the purchase price on marketing (the listing agent's main job), and they only need to fool one idiot into paying too high of a price.
5. **ambiguous pricing**. things like differing agent commissions, sellers covering closing costs, seller repairs, including furniture and/or appliances in the sale, and seller rent-back agreements makes it hard to actually figure out the real price difference between two ""comps"".
6. **imperfect knowledge.** even ignoring the effects of marketing, nobody has perfect knowledge of the condition of a house (or its surrounding neighborhood). inspections try to mitigate this issue, but it never really goes away.",2,,leadfoot9,0

open two accounts, one for investment and the other for speculation

i would advise you not to invest in virtual currencies, nft, or speculate in futures products (like gold futures). but i know that for the vast majority of young investors, they ignore other people's advice and dream of getting rich overnight, and that's a good thing, people only gain experience after failures and losses. the sooner one completes this learning process, the better. so, open even one account, one of them to speculate on these types of high-risk products.

another most common scenario for young investors is frequent trading. almost no investor was able to buy apple stock in 2010 and hold it until now. with frequent trading, sometimes you benefit a little, other times you incur losses, and overall, more losses than gains, and in the process, you learn nothing except to up the ante, until one day you lose the bet and lose your entire capital.

nonetheless, i still think the best way for a young investor to learn is to experience losses first, enough pain to make you learn to be cautious, learn to stop, plan your trades and then go trade.

losing $300 in 3 days is far better than losing $100,000 on one trade 10 years from now.

the nice thing about qyld is that the monthly dividends will give you a little incentive.

you can also invest in a conservative etf product like qyld in an aggressive way, using leverage plus compounding to accelerate your benefits.

1. the crashig of cryptocurrencies causes the old gpus which was used to mining them to flood the market, plus the over supply of gpu in stock as they produced based on the market  when crypto rised and demand for them was excessive makes the gpu price drop very quick for a few months now, and it will drop even further once the next gen gpu's released in the end of this year.
2. taiwan currently produces ~50% number of microchips for the whole world and they are used in every industry, every corner of human society. and those chips are produced using silicat sand and rare earth imported from china. with the current situation of the area the supply of microchip is very not secured.",3,,Megane_Senpai,0

1659637987,"assets (from stocks to houses) have value because you expect to get a return from them over time.

for example, by buying and inhabiting a house you do not pay rent. by renting it out, you gain rent. by buying most stocks, you get dividends. others do not pay dividends because expect to grow in value.

now, how do you value a stock that pays you ¬£1 in dividends per year, every year from now to eternity? there is a mathematical proof, but it simplifies - for a constant discount rate - to ¬£1/(discount rate).

in first approximation, the discount rate should be the central bank rate + something. let's say that something is 0% for simplicity. let's assume the boe interest rate is 1%. this represents the fact that if you gave me ¬£1 today, i could invest them at a 1% safe return, and get ¬£1.01 tomorrow. so receiving ¬£1 tomorrow is like receiving ¬£0.99 today! receiving ¬£1 in a hundred years is like receiving only a few pence today! if you gave me a few pences today, i could make ¬£1 after a century.

then, what is the value of our asset? it should be 1/(0.01) = ¬£100. that is, the asset paying ¬£1 from here to eternity is like receiving ¬£100 today! why? because if i invest ¬£100 at a 1% interest rate, i can get ¬£1 per year. but i need to give up ¬£100 today.

what happens if the rate increases to 2%? well, now it is equivalent to receiving 1/(0.02) = ¬£50 today.

so higher interest rate -&gt; you need less money today to generate the same stream of revenues. apple will keep producing iphones, make profits and pay dividends. however, this stream of dividend could be matched by investing in government bonds a lower sum than in the past! so the cost of one apple stock must be lower!

the same applies to every asset. reality is more nuanced, but this is the basic.",2,,xendor939,0

1659661703,"oh boy. $700 in eth a huge position for you right now. 

general guidelines and good practice is to limit your crypto trading/investments to 10% of your total portfolio because they're so volatile; if you currently have $2000 to trade with, max you'd want to put into crypto would be $200 (if you started with $2700, crypto portfolio would be $270).

another good metric to keep your eyes on is not to have more than 10% of a specific portfolio in any one security. again, if your stock portfolio is $2000, i wouldn't want to accumulate more than $200 worth of apple stock, and with a $200 crypto portfolio, i wouldn't want to have more than $20 worth of any one specific crypto. (these numbers obviously will grow as you contribute kore money to your portfolio each month, but make sure you are saving a little money to put into a savings account too for emergency savings. 10% of your net pay is a good benchmark for savings). 

i know it sucks, because we want to make big moves, right? but consider this: if you bought eth in early may, your entry was around $2700. come mid june, when it was scraping around $1000, you're lot more nervous when one third of your entire investment portfolio is worth less than half of what it was just 6 weeks earlier. 

a smaller position size gives you confidence maneuverability. $1000 would be a great place to dollar cost average your position down, but if your initial entry was a $700 position, you'd need to spend another $700 at the $1000 asking price to make any significant impact on your holding position. 

what price did you buy your etherium at? 

crypto is having a brief little move up (referred to as a bear flag) , but they're all almost certainly headed to lose half their value in the next 6 months or so.

if you just bought it in recently and you're in the green, i would suggest exiting at least 5/7 of your eth position  and pick some more up once it's dipped sub $1000 again.",2,,Robot_Embryo,0

what you're proposing has no meaning, accounting-wise. it doesn't make any sense. but i understand how we can come to think that way at the beginning, because every margin tutorial starts with ""you buy with 50% cash and borrow 50%.

but it doesn't in fact work that way at all.

**margin accounts work like a line of credit**. let's say you have 100k  dollars in the account, and buy 100k dollars worth of stock: you are not using **any** margin.

you only start using margin when you spend more money than you have put in.  so if you buy 110k's worth of stock, you are now using 10k of margin.  it has nothing to do with which stock was ""bought on margin"", you're just borrowing 10k.  it's the total balance of the acccount that matters. it works that way at all brokers, it's a legal standard.

you'll indeed be paying interest only on the $15,000 borrowed.

but the 50% margin, is not how much that $15,000 is going to apple or amazon, the money is not 'assigned"" to stock, it's just a loan you have for the account.

what a stock with a ""25% margin"" means, is that you only need to have 25% of its value to hold it. in other words, if you bought $100,000 of stock with a 25% margin requirement, your account value needs to remain above $25,000 at all time.  when stocks have different margin requirements, the calculation is complicated, but ib does that for you.  a penny stock usually has a 100% margin requirement, which means you need to pay it all and can't borrow on margin to hold it.",7,,frederic_r,0

1659810838,"there's of course a lot of different reasons, as is usually the case. these reasons don't all weight as much and it's hard to speculate on what reason carries the most weight in the mind of the ccp. 

here are a couple:

a) taiwan is the key to containing china is the south-china sea and also further in the pacific ocean. japan, korean peninsula, taiwan, the philippines and other islands nations are crucial when it comes to boxing in china. none more so than taiwan. if china controls taiwan the ""blockade"" is broken and china will be able to project immense naval- and economic power across the pacific. 

b) semiconductors. taiwan is the biggest manufacturer of certain types of semiconductors. there's a reason the u.s. has been rushing bills through their congress about domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. that's why nancy pelosi bought a ton of nvidia stock. 

c) other potential reasons:
- china is kinda screwed domestically. their ""wonder"" economic growth of +5% gdp every year for the past 25 years can't continue forever because they leveraged this growth. heavily leveraged it, actually. 
- china's economy is *very* reliant on their real estate market for growth. and it is crumbling. 
- the world is realigning after the pandemic. some call it deglobalization. the west is trying to be less dependent on imports from china. 
- china's energy problem is also a factor.
- this creates domestic problems and the ccp fears an uprising. like with all authoritarian regimes, their number one goal is their own preservation.

there is no better way to learn than by failing and realizing how much you really fucking hate to fail. so no matter what you do here, you're good.

after you lose it all, if you do ever go back to options, learn how to beat the game first.

here is my advice:

never trade any options other than on $spy (because spy has the highest volume, hence the lowest spread between options prices, and the least amount of slippage).

never trade any options without looking at a chart of the open interest data and understanding how to use it to your advantage.

i personally only trade credit spreads, and i would advise using credit spreads for the following strategy.

always bet that spy will either close above the high put peak or below the high call peak. when using this strategy, it only makes sense to trade short term expiration dates (one week out tops). the peaks can change, hence this strategy is not full proof.

for example, for spy options expiring this friday, aug 12th, the high put peak is at $390, and the high call peak is at $415. because i usually like to give myself a $1 cushion and a $2 spread on my credit spreads for spy, the open interest data tells me that i‚Äôm very confident that spy will close below $416 on friday, and above $389. so i would consider opening either a $416 / $418 bear call credit spread or a $387 / $389 bull put credit spread. because $spy is at $412.92 right now (closer to the high call peak), i will almost definitely be opening a $416/$418 bear call spread on monday, because a $387 / $389 bull put credit spread is too far away from the current price, and i won't make enough money relative to how much i‚Äôd have to risk.

and i almost always open my options on monday or tuesday with an expiration date of that same friday. if this friday is the monthly's (it's not), even better.

i don‚Äôt give a fuck about inflation.

i don‚Äôt give a fuck about russia and ukraine (in terms of it affecting my trading decisions).

i don‚Äôt give a fuck about china.

i don‚Äôt give a fuck about nancy pelosi.

i don't give a fuck about jim cramer.

and i don‚Äôt give a fuck about covid.

all i care about is the high put peak and the high call peak of spy. 

edit: (actually, if there are peaks that are almost as high as the high put peak and high call peak, i do care about them too, and they can affect my decisions.)

why!?!?

because the market is manipulated.

the market doesn‚Äôt necessarily go up when there are more buyers than sellers.

the market makers are the biggest players in the game (by far), and they choose which way the market goes every fucking second that it‚Äôs open (when i say ""choose"", i mean they are programmed to act, hence the term ""algorithms""). and the market makers goal is to make as much money as possible. the way they do that is not by buying $aapl and holding it forever. the way the market makers make money is by tricking you into losing money.

so why do i bet that spy will close below the high call peak? because if it closes above that peak, market makers gotta pay those guys off. and the market makers choose which way to manipulate the market in order for option writers / sellers (mm‚Äôs, in general) to make the most amount of money and for option buyers (retail traders, in general, like op buying calls) to lose the most amount of money.  same reason why i bet it will close above the high put peak, cause if it closes below, mm‚Äôs gotta pay them off, and mm's don't like losing, just like you and me.

true, we could say this about any strike price and we'd be lost regarding which strike prices to pick. however, the most important peaks are the ones with the highest open interest (the potential for the market makers to lose the most money), so in general, those are  by far the best strike prices to work with because they are the strike prices that the market makers will care most about.

lastly, credit spreads imply that i am taking in a credit by selling options. i never buy options (such as a debit spread, or buying puts or calls).",6,,I_am_mad_ok,0

so yeah, i agree that it'd be hard to find a real person who had as much love for straight oughta compton as they did for achy breaky heart. or who fought in the gulf war and also had a slacker job in a skateboard shop at the mall.  but the story wouldn't require that character to be believable just like forrest gump wasn't believable. or to (explicitly) pick a side in the culture wars.",8,,Bangkok_Dangeresque,0

1659908260,"your right , the hardest part of this is the timing but the market will be dipping again very soon under $400. that is a fact because the fed finally stopped printing endless money and they **have** to raise interest rates since inflation is crazy high.

&amp;#x200b;

if they stop raising interest rates or do anymore qe while inflation is over the 2% annual target, it will be a direct violation of their mandates which means the central banking system is failing.

&amp;#x200b;

part of getting inflation back down directly correlates with the stock market losing ""liquidity"" aka the money supply. so your right, good luck on your timing though.

&amp;#x200b;

the only way the market can continue higher however is if the fed allows inflation to remain at over 2% and do nothing about it. if that happens then you know the central banks have failed (including boe) and then its time to hedge against hyper inflationary forces.

&amp;#x200b;

but to be honest, i would be extremely shocked if they stop raising interest rates anytime soon because that would be them allowing inflation to destroy the fiat dollar on purpose. it would mean that the fiat dollar is no different from monopoly money where they can print endless paper and get away with it by letting inflation erode the value of the debt on purpose. imagine buying a 10 year treasury note or $aapl bonds @ 3%  and then between 2022-2032 inflation averages at say 4%/annually over the next 10 years.....that would be a real eye opener to the world that the us financial system is fake.",3,,eznahman,0

thank you.

&gt;because if demand for tomatoes is the same, and there's no reason to think it isn't since gas has nothing to do with it, people will find ways to get it.

if there is less money chasing a commodity, and the commodity is in a free market, then the price of that commodity goes down. that's the law of supply and demand. it applies as much to the supply of money as it does to tomatoes. that's the quantity theory of money.

&amp;#x200b;

says the guy that pretends to stand on a moral high ground when he knows nothing about the person he's attacking.

you seem to treat crypto as a pure ponzi; it's just x dumping on y.

putting aside the fact that regardless of whether it's vcs or drug dealers from 2011 that were just released from jail, it doesn't matter who the ""rich"" is; bitcoin is incredibly unequal in its wealth distribution as well, and you're getting ""dumped on by rich people"" too regardless, so this entire argument is completely moot and only idiots would eat it up...

but putting that aside, crypto isn't a zero-sum game. bill gates selling some of his microsoft stock doesn't make microsoft a scam. there's nothing wrong with founders/vcs making money.

it doesn't mean people who bought microsoft or google or amazon stock from the vcs/founders are ""poor people being dumped on"". 

the only thing that matters if the tech is valuable, whether it will find product-market fit, and whether it'll be worth more in the future because of actual value being created, rather toxic maxis getting angry at others for not pumping their own bags because their coins are absolutely worthless and useless and only propped up by ponzi.",2,,warmbookworm,0

**in 2022, i sold that stock for $20,500,000 dollars.**

what helped me a lot is having the same strong finance guy for all my purchases. it is little tight but doable. fiance lives with me but just focuses on schools and pays cash for her classes. no help from her is needed for bills. she just cleans, cooks and sometimes pays for food.

1660089563,"i'm not the person who made the original distinction, but here's my take.

factors and styles are basically the same thing. some firms will tell you that there are subtle differences between them but it's basically all the same thing. aqr says [they're the same](https://funds.aqr.com/insights/fund-promo/style-investing). russell says factors indexes are just [more concentrated style indexes](https://www.ftserussell.com/research/styles-vs-factors-what-they-are-how-theyre-similardifferent-and-how-they-fit-within). 

though when i personally think about the difference between the two, the first thing that comes to mind is the [venn model](https://www.venn.twosigma.com/factors) by two sigma. in that model, factors are basically considered to be drivers of a portfolio's risk/return profile. pretty standard. but there's a split between macro factors and style factors. macro factors represent exposure to things like market, rates and credit risk (core macro) or secondary macro variables like fx risk, inflation-linked vs nominal rates risk (so basically t5yie and t10yie), home country vs foreign market risk (like us vs ex-us for an american investor, canada vs ex-canada for a canadian, etc.). on the other hand, styles represent exposure to *cross-sectional* drivers of risk and return like value and momentum in equities or carry in currencies.

styles are also more of a practitioner-based concept than factors. you don't really see them mentioned that much in academia. there, factors are often seen as proxies for consumption risk (merton's icapm state variable candidates) or expressions of firm-decisions that predict differences in firm-level cost of capital (zhang's icapm factors).

however, these semantics don't really matter. they have nothing to with your criticisms of value. think of the trades a value manager would have on right now. it's not a static long energy and financials short tech portfolio. and even if it was, all throughout this post you're implying that there's a tech industry premium (""modern tech growth strategies are so great"" and things like that) without anything to back it up. but back to the trades. just comparing the enterprise multiples (or p/es for banks) of some household names, it would be long $meta and short (or underweight) $pins. long $trow and short $blk. long $gs and short $ms. long $pep and short $ko. and these trades would probably just be on for a few months or less until the longs were repriced and migrated out of the value basket and/or the shorts were repriced and migrated out of the growth basket. how does a blitzscaling startup mechanically make these trades lose money? about 80% of them won't even be in tech sector. and the majority of those that are will be long and short mature firms. and even then, how does a random tech company's rapid asset growth make the expensive banks or asset managers or food and beverage companies beat the cheap ones? and that's before all the issues we know rapid asset growers face (terrible empirical performance, theoretically low cost of capital holding productivity constant per zhang's icapm, historically poor earnings growth in periods of low payout ratios for the market as a whole, etc.). i'm not saying the idea is completely terrible, there's definitely a lot of merit to the q-eg factor and to investing in companies with high levels of intangible investment, but even those strategies don't kill value investing. they're completely separate. the long-term correlation coefficient between hml and expected growth is 0.06. it's even positive. and the guy who discovered the expected growth factor literally publicly stated that he still has his own money in scv... 

anyways, it seems like you have a background in finance, so what do you even want us to tell you? you already know these counterarguments, so what do you really want to hear? that all academic and practitioner research on stock selection since fama-french or even security analysis is completely useless now despite the fact that new evidence confirming those core ideas is still continuously being brought to light? do you want the green light to buy arkk? pre-ipo shares in the next uber but for pool supplies?",4,,throwaway474673637,0

maybe this example would make the point: we can start that all this shouldn't be allowed, i think we could probably agree or at least see relatively eye to eye there. but if we were to say what would be the most blatant i feel this would be blatant --&gt; let's say before the covid pandemic, before schools and businesses shut down nancy pelosi bought stock in zoom, a company, for as far as i know, was non-existent, or at least very little people used or heard about (i sure as hell did not and was confused on what this zoom was we were gonna use in college). so lets say, that's going on -- and then pelosi buys a shit ton of zoom stock, and then this nobody company called zoom is going to be the program all businesses and schools use, that would be some blatant in your face shit. nvidia is a very established company, and this is in their line of work.

it would make sense regardless to buy nvidia stock. i think you're going to think i'm just defending pelosi on this shit, and i'm not, i'm more just saying that this is not the most shady of trades. like you said, not good, while it was public knowledge, this was very few days before congress passed this -- it rightfully raises alarm bells, i just don't think its as sketch as its led on to be in this specific respect.",1,,LazzoGreggo,0

1660123588,"&gt; pelosi went to taiwan to increase the nvidea stock prices that her husband just bought.

you pretty much got everything wrong in your statement here aside from the visiting taiwan part. it was tsmc not nvidia they still had shares in at the time of pelosi's visit (they'd already sold their nvidia stock at a major loss in july) and her visiting would lower the stock price, not increase it due to higher tensions in the region.

i'm not going to speculate on the pelosi's suspicious portfolio in general but in this particular instance i'm not really seeing the benefit since they own stocks in tsmc?

lastly this doesn't necessarily have to be a mutually exclusive move. pelosi has historically been extremely anti ccp with her protesting at tiananmen square in 1991, advocated for chinese political prisoners and dissidents to be able to come to the united states, backed a bill naming china a currency manipulator, and criticized the imprisonment of hong kong democracy activists to name a few of her actions.",5,,qa3rfqwef,0
1660126463,"&gt;if an underlying index falls to 4/5 of it's value, it recovers going up 5/4 of its value (4/5 x 5/4 = 1).  loss of 20% from initial value, a gain of 25% from the lower value, and it is made whole.

sometime math doesn't explain reality. if microsoft stock falls 50% overnight because somebody said ceo used bad word for black people, and the day after this news turns out to be false, the stock will return back to its initial value. was some extra effort needed for the return, or it was as easy as the process of going down?

also, it is well known that after big recessions recovers are especially strong and fast, and that stocks go up much easier and faster than if there was not recession. like there was not needed doubled effort that math explains and even contrary.

the math calculation that 10% downturn needs 11% upward to break even is disconnected from reality and real world applications.",0,,Honest-Economics-601,0

1660201207,"&gt; because the value of btc isn‚Äôt dependent on any singular external entity. a stock is dependent on the business it‚Äôs associated with. we can‚Äôt all hit all the bangers, so why not buy a relatively independent asset only influenced solely by the public market surrounding that asset? at this point i‚Äôm starting to see the btc chart similar to investing in an index. over the next 50 years btc could very well beat the index both in returns and inflation, but lose to the banger stocks within that index. i may be wrong in using that analogy.


is apple stock dependent on a single external entity?  i would say no.  they're a multinational that has a million business factors.  and few lay people are doing single stock picking.  most buy index funds or mutual funds.  they will not all be bangers nor will they all go bankrupt.  btc has all the concentration risk of picking a single stock or bond, but you're not even rewarded with dividends or interest payments.

&gt; stocks are only cash flowing if you buy and sell appropriately. true btc believers have no intentions to sell btc for usd or any other traditional currency.

help me understand this one.  you work hard, save money, buy bitcoin, and then...just sit on it until you die? this makes no sense to me.   thinking of it as a crazy volatile and unproductive piggy bank, i can understand that, but to hold for life?

furthermore stocks don't need to flow.  since they represent ownership of future cash flows, they can appreciate without even paying dividends.  apple didn't even pay a dividend until 2012 and had plenty of growth before that.




&gt; on top of that, btc isn‚Äôt a stock. it‚Äôs not meant to be seen in the same light really. it‚Äôs moreso meant to be seen in the same light as gold. is gold a productive asset? why do people invest in gold then? it‚Äôs a secure asset over time and independent of a government. what makes btc better than gold is the relative ease of use re: transactions for both sides of the transaction



gold is a commodity.  imo, it's generally a dumb investment as it's also not productive but it has the benefit of being generally stable in prices thanks to the global markets that buy it for jewelry and manufacturing.",5,,coriolisFX,0

2. they should tell the company first (i was wrong about this article but 'cti labs' from israel behaved in a sketchy way and publicized it and amd themselves said they were not contacted),
3. yes, but after they disclose it to the company. if they name the vulnerability ""nvidiafail!"" and make a website with extreme language and then short nvidia stock without giving nvidia a moment to fix the vulnerability first, that is manipulation and it reflects poorly on their character (i didn't say make it illegal)
4. i never said 'not allow.' i agree that the information should be public - after the company is notified. the very article we're posting under had the researcher contact tesla so they could mitigate the problem - so the researcher i was wrong about agrees that you should contact the company first.
5. i never said the information should be 'hidden' - i made a judgement about people who publicize and megaphone flaws far and wide to get attention before contacting the company so they can fix it first.

i didn't say there should be a law 'prohibiting' anything, and i don't know what the best delay after informing a company before publicizing it should be. maybe a month is good? two?

if widespread hacks can hurt people, then it is poor character for a person to find a flaw and blast it on social media and tell everyone how to do the hack before giving the company a chance to fix it. i know the article we're talking about this didn't happen - but this is what happened with the cti labs example i gave.

a cpu flaw in server cpus that could let nefarious people in could lead to hacks of websites that get people's accounts compromised and cause real harm to regular people.

my opinion boiled down is:

if a person has the choice of:

1. quietly informing a company so they can solve a vulnerability that could cause damage and then a month later share the information publicly
2. blasting on social media, making websites, and press videos dramatizing the failures and naming the failures for maximum damage without even contacting the company first

doing #2 will make me think that person is an asshole.

i get your price increase that could lead to more access to capital, but that's not always the case.  a stock buy isn't necessarily a stock price increase after all.  if 10 people bought 10% share of a company for $100 each, and they couldn't sell it for $100 so they sell it it to me for $90, the stock of the company definitely didn't increase.  this isn't an ""investment"" by me, because the money isn't going to the company, the company gets literally nothing from my purchase. except possibly knowledge that people don't want to own their company as much as they did previously.

lets say i own aapl stock and i'm going to be selling those shares for a car in 6 months. i'm worried about the economy, so i want to ""lock in"" my sell price. so what do i do? i buy a put option. that way, i lock in a sell price.

my life is less stressful because now i have a minimum price i'm locked in at. maybe the option will expire worthless (ie: aapl's stock is higher), in which case i sell to the open market rather than the put-option to get my car.

--------

the reverse is going to be true. lets say i know that i'm going to be selling my car in 6 months, and i want to lock in a buy-price for aapl shares. i can buy a call option expiring 6 months from now at a worst-case price point. (what if the stock market skyrockets in 6 months? i dunno. lemme lock in a price point today. i don't have the money yet, but i know i'll have the money in 6 months).

--------

the ""other reverse"" is also true. lets say i'm exiting from the marketplace and i own aapl shares. i don't care what price i get, but i understand that people out there are worried about volatility. so instead of selling my aapl shares directly, i sell a covered call-option. in this case, i **might** be forced to sell my aapl shares (which is good), or i **might** keep my aapl shares (kinda-sorta bad, but not really). in this case, i'm providing a service and risking the price action, in exchange for $$$$.

finally, the converse-opposite is also true. lets say i'm entering the marketplace and i want to own aapl shares. i don't care what price i get, as long as its better than the current market rates, and i understand that there are people out there worried about volatility. so instead of buying aapl shares directly, i sell a covered put-option. i **might** be forced to buy aapl shares at that price (which is good), or i **might** not get any buyers if aapl skyrockets in price. in this case, i'm providing a service and risking the price action, in exchange for direct $$$$

1660262928,"i work blue collar job, i make ok money but we wouldn't be able to survive without family help (thanks for telling us to pop out all those kids tscc!). when i learned about the slush fund and that i could've just been buying apple stock on our behalf rather than a church (at that time i still saw it as a church, this wouldve been like early 2020?).

i got like angry and teared up with frustrating as it dawned on me that i was lied to. especially when they dangle that carrot of its only temporary and the church will do away with it once they are financially set bullshit. tithing could've been the difference between saving for a house, retirement, kids college, hell even to eat better or a better family trip. thank ""god"" we are lucky enough to have family than helps us freely. 

how they even justify telling people to pay an organization before the health and safety of one's family is disgusting and infuriating. we are pimo currently but if someone broaches the subject of tithing i might go off and expose ourselves. when we get asked for tithing declaration i'll just text them ""we declare a full tithe and there is no need to meet with the bishop thank you.""",29,,NTylerWeTrust86,0

typically on these loans, they give you too much money. buy apple stock, let it roll, and when she graduates, she should be able to drop a good payment on principle immediately- or a good dividend plan (to help with the bills later on). most offer deferred billing and you can always return or use pay down before you graduate.

1660264759,"**you're ignoring everything i wrote. incredible. it's a mobile phone, grow up.**

&gt;the yearly sales figures as well as the resale value of the iphone se

what has that anything to do with ""*$429 dollar phone with some of the worst specs at the time of release*"", you seem to not understand the topic at hand. **it's about specifications**, you're talking about ""***investment***"":

**a:** *""why did you buy this* ***big phone***\*?""\*

**b:** *""i use the* ***big display*** *to watch youtube, netflix, and play games. why did you buy the small phone with a* ***tiny*** ***display*** *that's difficult to view content?""*

**a:** *""investment, of course, it has massive resale!""*

you talking about re-sale when mentioning se is a useless metric. if you cared about money rather than the product itself, you would have just invested in stocks instead of a mobile phone.

&gt;it outpaces android competitors in this price range

wow, you **literally ignored my entire comment**, every single word i wrote on my previous reply..

i wrote that the se has objectively poor battery life, and an extremely tiny display, but with a v8 engine. to make that analogy easier to comprehend, it means that **the iphone se compromises luxury for performance.**

again, the vast majority does not care about a tiny-little-baby display with a powerful soc. read that again slowly.

&gt;the superior image processing of the a15 chip means that the se is producing higher quality photos than basically any phone in its price range

what is the superior part? is it rotten-eggs compared to a cookie, or a chocolate-chip cookie compared to a plain-cookie? is it worth sacrificing luxury for a photo you can barely see on such a small phone?

&gt;i think probably it‚Äôs best selling point is it‚Äôs operating system support life

so incredible that the sales are so astronimically low. the vast majority of people don't care about a tiny-little phone. you're acting as if it's like investing $400 on apple stock and getting $12,000 the next year. it's not a good investment.

you're only supporting it because of software-support and performance, while sacrificing battery life, and display-size? most people like to watch youtube and netflix. is that just not important? it is very important to majority of users, otherwise, **why does the iphone se not have hundreds of millions of sales?**

1660283326,"pwm is not a fund. a fund is basically a pool of money. if i raise $100 from every member of this sub and i invest it in the market i have a fund. i could have a vanilla fund where i just invest in equities (stock like apple stock for example) or debt securities (bonds). or i can have a more complex strategy/investing. trading derivatives (options) in order to hedge. those type of firms charge more than your more vanilla fund. i could also invest/buy in private businesses instead, this would be your private equity/venture capital funds. funds are usually a partnership. there are general partners, and limited partners. the limited partners are the rich ppl who contributed to the fund raising $650 mm. like somebody else said, there are legal reasons why a normal person like you and me could not invest in a hedge fund, but we can invest in say a mutual fund. the general partners are people who are pretty much the boss of everyone at the fund. 

pwm usually refers to the wealth management service line of investment banks. and they usually want uhnw client (ultra high net worth clients)

pwm means i am a ‚Äúwealth manager‚Äù where i have clients that have different means. maybe i advise them about how to invest their money. maybe they want me to help them plan for retirement. maybe they want me to help them with setting up a trust and they need me to set them up with someone who could do that. i don‚Äôt need to raise money from my clients and create a private equity fund because again, pwm is not a fund, it‚Äôs not a collection of money from investors. 

if you want to learn more about funds, their legal structure, how to start one, how they operate, i recommend watching bridger pennington. he‚Äôs a youtuber. his dad was a fund manager, he started his own fund, etc.

a reallife example would be philips. a multi billion dollar company active in the health industry. they  made 1 huge mistake with their cpap machines (https://www.drugwatch.com/philips-cpap/recall/). there is a lawsuit incoming and a fairly stable company went from ‚Ç¨50 a share to less than 20 within the year.

let's say apple's stock is $100 per share today and you expect it will be worth $110 by the end of next week. you can buy a put option that will give you the option to buy shares of apple for, let's say, $102. the person that you are buying the option from takes a fee to offer this to you.

at the end of next week, if apple's stock has indeed gone up to $110, you have the option to buy it at only $102 and then you can immediately sell it for an $8/share profit.

but, if the price went down, you can choose not to exercise the option. you still have to pay the fee though.",1,,aragorn18,0

1660331787,"james woods used to be a hollywood star, though in 2017 he announced he was essentially done with acting as he had been blacklisted from hollywood and didn‚Äôt need the work thanks to having bought apple stock in the 1980s‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

so, he‚Äôs willing and able to be quite open about what he thinks, and routinely uses that freedom to sound off on hot-button issues on twitter, where he‚Äôs known for being a right-leaning dissident, particularly on cultural topics.

‚ûñand now he‚Äôs back at it, this time sounding off on the topic of electric vehicles, cars that have somehow become the current thing despite being almost unusable for road trips or basic tasks expected of them.

woods, however, in his criticism of electric cars doesn‚Äôt focus on those typical, mundane problems with them. having to wait forever for them to charge, dealing with the tech as it matures and the batteries slowly become more useful, the problems posed by lithium fires‚Ä¶all those problems are real and must be dealt with, but they‚Äôve already been brought up and will be endlessly debated.

so, in his attack on evs, woods brought up the safety issue associated with them, something that no one else has really focused on as of yet.

tweeting about that, woods said:

&gt;the unspoken nightmare of owning an electric vehicle is the safety issue. a woman alone forced to sit for an hour charging her ev on a dark highway is not a comforting scenario, except to the roving gangs of hoodie thugs roaming our streets and highways.

and while there aren‚Äôt many articles on that topic yet, the problem of women being harassed at a gas station is a very real one. harassment is already a real problem at gas stations, where fill ups currently just take a few minutes. think how bad that problem will be if charging takes an hour or more. 

clean technica, for instance, ran a good article highlighting current problems with gas stations and electric vehicle charging, saying:

&gt;ev charging operators need to prioritize safety ‚Äî especially women‚Äôs safety. our friends at irishevs shared two articles with me that touch upon safety issues that women are dealing with while charging their evs while traveling. they highlight how ev charging operators need to take safety into account in order to not lose/miss customers and also simply make sure their stations are safe places to charge.

&gt;‚Ä¶..

&gt;there are countless stories of women being harassed at gas stations. just last month in atlanta, a woman was shot and killed at a gas station. so, our friends at irishevs are making an excellent point about safety at ev charging sites ‚Äî especially women‚Äôs safety.

gas stations are already problem areas from a safety perspective, particularly as crime spikes and soft-on-crime policies embolden criminals. that‚Äôll likely just get worse as the evs take long times to charge and criminals continue to be emboldened.

###[‚Äòsitting ducks‚Äô: ev charging stations leave some drivers feeling exposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatedisalarm/comments/vf3yl3/sitting_ducks_ev_charging_stations_leave_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

charging an ev is more complicated and time consuming than pulling up to a well-lit service station with cameras and attendants nearby and refuelling in mere minutes. it takes at least 20 minutes to charge, if you‚Äôre lucky enough to find a dc fast charger that can charge at the speeds promised by auto makers. if you can only find a level 2 charger, you could be at the station for hours.

1660339173,"regression is a way to ""regress"" the relevant variables in order to discover the correlation between those variables.

here's a literal way to do a regression:

let's say we want to manually calculate the intercept (alpha) and the slope coefficient (beta) for $aapl (the dependent variable y) against the s&amp;p500 (the independent variable x)

we will use returns for $spy for the s&amp;p500

download daily returns of $aapl and $spy and import them into excel.

next, calculate the daily % return for each of them (should be easy but if you need help, ask)

now, you need to go the data tab and select data analysis. a window will pop up, scroll down to regression.

select the daily % return range of $spy for the independent variable (x) and the daily % return range of $aapl for the dependent variable (y)

then run the regression. a bunch of data will pop up, you can google what each term in the regression data means but the intercept and slope coefficient are the most relevant in this case.

she does not own individual stocks and it's really misleading to even say she owns stocks but doesn't trade them. saying she owns stocks makes it sound like she has a bunch of apple stock and she just doesn't trade it actively, and that's not the case. she has mutual funds, not individual stocks, which isn't problematic (other than to the extent that no one person should have the level of wealth she does, but that's not the type of problem she's calling out with the tweet).

mutual funds don't work in a way that you can use your own inside knowledge about the companies/regulations to manipulate your gains. each mutual fund is made up of a ton of individual stocks that each contribute to a tiny fraction of the fund, and someone else makes decisions about buying and selling such that the fund's makeup changes dynamically and in ways that are absolutely outside the control, even outside the awareness, of the person who buys into a fund.

do you think that just because on monday we will get a business update that something massively new is going to be said? what more then ""we completed the testing and we are just waiting for it to be launched"" can he possibly say? the business was basically built a long time ago already. whether or not the market (not the investors, but people that might want connectivity) will value it highly is a much bigger question mark as well as the risks regarding operating such a space based system (e.g. if it came equiped with a space laser there would be less risk), particularly one in which some countries might be opposed to it being there. 

there is also the question of competition, but i wonder what really can be meaningfully patented in this space. sending signals is not new, phased arrays have been in military use for a very long time, and fpgas are also not new. 

the recent run up was irrational. 

the risk for dilution has not been removed either, so you have some rich dudes that can get shares for half the price. why would you want to fund those when you don't have to? 

i wish i could see the stupid faces of people buying above $11 in the past few days or to make it even worse a plot with iq vs price paid. 

the memes being posted just shows that someone is just hyping up the stock. a good stock doesn't need memes. so, if you bought after seeing a meme, all you are doing is funding whoever made those memes. you are going to lose money (unless of course asts becomes some massive success against all odds with no issues whatsoever (remember that first time they had to delay their launch)). asts doesn't own the satellite bus technology company anymore and sold for a fraction of the value estimated by the market. if anything, the stock should be closed to $4, if $6 was a reasonable price before. 

i have done my own dcf of the company (someone posted a matrix some time ago) and i picked my own set of squares. i think what i paid for it was already optimistic, but it was much less optimistic than whatever those people were claiming to be reasonable. usually, investment is done in some way such that the tam is actually meaningfully defined. i don't agree at all that it is. 

so, i did only what is sane. i sold on the day it hit $12 and i also sold some yesterday. 

even if there is some great news on monday (note, after the end of trading (!)), it still would not warrant going from $6 to $11, since nothing has really changed. i'd say the most volatile time of this company should be around the time it launches and during the first three quarters of actual revenue generation (e.g. is it going to flat line or it is going to the moon and can new satellites be easily funded from existing operations). 

so, what is the ceo going to say other than ""how great the team was and how they completed all the tests""? if they did something of great value, then most of the market probably didn't even know that thing existed in the first place, so in that case it would still go over the head of most investors. 

if i had a big hedge fund and larger balls, i would short it all the way to $7. 

many people are saying ""has there been any news?"". the answer was the same: all that happened that it got some media attention (translation: some normal people that don't hang around on such forums bought some shares from some more informed people and the stock will revert to the mean). you can do all the research in the world about the technology, but at some point a lot of people need to decide that they really need this. asts doesn't have signed contracts or letters of intent from some random people in africa (that's just what people *believe* will happen). perhaps some percentage of the africans will say ""i will just use wifi to call"". who knows? sure they did ""market research"", but have you seen the actual report and methods they used in their ""research"" (or, what are the credentials of the person that did this?)? no, then how can you possibly be certain that will happen? 

so, yes, asts is not a foolish investment at $7, but it is at $11. 

i have been investing for a long time. 

$asml is an _actual_ great company with a real monopoly, but it trades at a p/e of &gt; 38 (which is already high, since is it really going to outcompete $meta by 3x in the next 10 years?). the moon some people (if they are people and not bots) talk about here is just not realistic. i think the business reporting coming from asts is also weak, which should also result in a lower valuation compared to some companies that have next to perfect business reporting systems in place. businesses that know their numbers know what they are doing. does asts know? how would i know? why are you paying for something that isn't provably there?

a crash in the market is anything over a 10% reduction in value quickly.

secondly you can‚Äôt do the 2012 thing because each year new models are released per reference. you can get a 2019 daytona ceramic and 2018 ceramic. they are the same watch but priced differently due to age.

1660518578,"gonna use this opportunity to copy and paste my previous aapl dd.  i am holding a lot of nov aapl 140p and oct 145p now

tl;dr aapl had an amazing 2021 due to stimmy and other pandemic dynamics but it's valued like it will continue to perform at that level.

about 85% of apple revenue is hardware sales which is unique among big tech and actually closer to amazon than google.  2021 was a massively successful year for apple due to stimmy (increased revenue of 33% yoy with iphones up 42% yoy) compared to much smaller increases previous years (10-20%).  in fact, iphone sales, the main driver, were actually declining prior to the pandemic.  all the new iphones purchased in 2021 will likely dampen sales for next generation as iphones do not need to be replaced every year.

additonally, q3 is already a low sales quarter due to anticipation of new iphone release next quarter.  however,  this could actually mitigate a drop in sales this quarter as management could dismiss it as people just waiting for the new iphone generation.  

altogether, i think aapl is overvalued and primed for correction, especially since it has fallen the least among big tech. basically, apple is the biggest pandemic stock but hasn't yet come back to earth like zoom or peleton or amazon.  it is still priced like its 2021 performance will continue, but i think that is unlikely to be the case. 

additionally, apple stock has cult status and it will be hard to drop unless the failure is very obvious.  finally,  they don't provide guidance,  so any shock to share price will have to come from macro news or their announcements",2,,DarklyAdonic,0

as i said last week in another thread. the entire mastercard network is compromised so there's nothing we can do about it. probably visa too but we just don't know it yet. 

and ally fraud department got u on hold for so long because there's probably thousands of other customers who also just got these charges also calling. i'm not even bothering. this will be my 3rd replacement card in less than a year probably only to be hacked again before i even get it. i'm done

i‚Äôm guessing none of you have a freedom sim to try this out with. 

by the way, we use 2 definitions of an unlocked phone, especially iphones. carrier unlocked means you got it from a carrier and they unlocked it (such as freedom). completely unlocked means you got it from apple and it was never locked to begin with. your issue will fall under the former and not the latter. keep that in mind. so the next time you see a phone that‚Äôs unlocked, ask if it‚Äôs carrier or completely as the two have very different meanings. 

if it‚Äôs locked to freedom there‚Äôs only 2 valid scenarios here. that someone forgot to put the unlock request in (and you‚Äôll definitely need the original proof of purchase, not second hand as u/hairlessplanter said or it was stolen (and yes, stolen phones do end up overseas).",1,,Driver8666-2,0

the point of reflections is to reward for holding. if you want to ‚Äúget rich‚Äù from them you‚Äôll need to invest more. higher risk higher reward. that‚Äôs true of any type of interest, dividend or reward system. 

of course people that only threw a few hundred dollars aren‚Äôt getting anything worth while. that‚Äôs like complaining you bought a few hundred dollars worth of apple stock but only get a few dollars a year in dividends. or put $1,000 in a saving account and got a few pennies worth of interest. 

as far as the card goes, i‚Äôm not sure what there is to be upset about. safemoon is not meant to replace your credit or fiat. it‚Äôs meant as another option to have access to your safemoon and other crypto. to cash out your safemoon now you need to swap with the 10% fee then transfer than bnb to an exchange and then sell there. that takes days to happen sometimes.

the card allows you to purchase instantly with the fee being 75% less than what it would traditionally take to cash out your safemoon. 

also if you carry a balance on a credit card that could cost you around 25% apy a year (double the 10% buy and 2.5% purchase fee together) and some bank accounts have fees up to $30 monthly. so those cards aren‚Äôt necessarily fee free either.",6,,jaybanks16,0

let‚Äôs say you were gifted a giant load of gold. and you in turn around and sell the gold to fund a business. i don‚Äôt believe you selling gold to fund your business would all of a sudden change the status of gold from a commodity into a security. pretty much the existence of something, wether it being digital or not, doesn‚Äôt automatically make it a security. 

for something to be properly considered a security, it has to fit the 4 prongs of the howey test. which the xrp token doesn‚Äôt quite fit into all 4 prongs properly. mainly a common enterprise is hard to pinpoint. sec says the common enterprise is ripple, which isn‚Äôt exactly true. because if ripple were to create to exist tomorrow xrp would still be used by other entities like normal.

i can get you more quotes from leaders teaching this if you want but i‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to do your homework for you. 

how much literature have you read outside of church sources?  have you read the [ces letter](https://cesletter.org/) or [a letter to my wife?](https://www.letterformywife.com/the-letter)

you do know the church is incredibly sexist, actually bigoted, unlike the way you like to reference that word, towards the lgbtq community and hoards over 130 billion dollars instead of feeding the poor and needy?  do you know how gross it looks to be a member of this church and defend even these things?  

do i have a vendetta against the church that lied to me for 35 years about their history and have treated me like a pariah since leaving??  yeah maybe i‚Äôm offended by how disgustingly immoral this religion is and how it takes 10%  from the poor through coercion and threatening to take away your eternal blessings if you don‚Äôt pay just to keep piling it into apple stock and deny people who desperately need help??  yeah i would say i‚Äôm offended by being lied to, being treated less than as a woman, watching people suffer because they happen to be gay and want to hurt themselves because they believe that these leaders speak for god and they can‚Äôt have love. 

i‚Äôm an atheist, i hate all religion, i think it‚Äôs ridiculous to believe in magic and fairly tales in this day and age and to believe in a religion that a convicted con man looked in a top hat at a rock to write holy scripture is beyond silly. this religion has done so much harm to so many people, including all those that had to practice polygamy because again their eternal salvation depended on it and left them destitute. what about when they denied black people temple ordinances and the priesthood because the colour of their skin?  i would say that if you need evidence as to why your church is false, go read something and educate yourself because it‚Äôs embarrassing that someone would connect themselves to such an obvious fraud that harms people in such terrible ways.",1,,justshyof15,0

now, i know you cite a 50-year time horizon, but in finance that‚Äôs considered too long  to be meaningful. volatility is too great to count on 50 years. (this, at least, has been my experience doing financial analysis as a management consultant.)

you do mention in your comment that if you had put money in apple stock you‚Äôd be a millionaire, but likewise if you had put money in pets.com stock (considered a better investment 25 years ago) you would have nothing. so the index rate of 8% i think is the best to use. 

this is not to say you‚Äôre wrong if you‚Äôre talking about custom guitars or having 50 guitars or what have you, but i think your regret is taking on a greater value than the numbers suggest.

**apple stock price inflation**  
apple (nasdaq: aapl) has been an excellent investment for many years now. the stock price just keeps going up, and up, and up. let's find out why.  
**stock buybacks**  
financial engineering has a bad reputation because of the implication that it's used to hide flaws in a business. now, that being said, perhaps something ""dark"" and manipulative is happening with aapl stock with relation to financial engineering. here is what **cnbc** said in 2019:  
*apple's aggressive use of its copious cash resources to repurchase its shares at modest valuations in recent years has shown the power of buybacks for a maturing company that is clearly in a growth lull. and, apple is not a typical company, long-term shareholders view it more as a financial asset, and have directly benefited from the company's spending on capital investment.*  
while this may slander aapl reputation, the fact is that aapl is openly manipulating its own stock in a manner that could be described as self-dealing. the company is using its cash to proactively pander to large financial institutions and smart money investors. but the aapl stock buybacks are at least rational given the valuation.   
the slowdown in iphone unit sales in the past few years has slowed apple's overall growth since its fiscal year ended sept. 30, 2015. in fact, net income this fiscal year is projected to be almost exactly equal to what apple booked several years earlier.  
**global central banks**  
since 2020, global central banks have been pumping $834 million into the financial markets every 60 minutes‚Ä¶ and every 60 minutes the market cap of global tech stocks has risen $780 million.  
so, an insane amount of money is being printed and pumped into the financial system, which increases demand for financial assets, and then that added money pours into aapl stock itself. that is, investors buy the stock because the price of the stock keeps going up.   
when you increase the money supply, smart money people use that money to chase after financial assets, assets like aapl stock. in other words, increases the money supply inflates the price of a stock itself. in effect, when m2 increases, you get inflation in the real world, but you also get asset inflation in the price of stocks, like aapl.  
although aapl is getting more and more mature, it's still a growth stock. i mean that in terms of products and services, aapl is no longer a growth stock, but in terms of stock price, aapl still moves like a growth stock. and, as its stock price grows, it's actually acting like a battery, holding financial energy. as the m2 money supply increases at a fast pace, aapl is the kind of company that can roughly keep pace with inflation, because of investor demand.  
in plain terms, inflation is driving up prices. because of investor demand, aapl stock price increases, which causes it to capture more of that money, even if each dollar is worth a bit less. furthermore, aapl stock continues to appreciate, holding the value of previously invested money so that purchasing power holds.  
for many investors, it's far better to hold aapl as an asset than cash. as the money supply increases, every unit of ""money value"" decreases. however, if your assets can keep pace, or do better, then you can keep racing ahead of that inflation curve. again, aapl is a financial battery, because it holds value.",1,,ThreeSupreme,0

""development of the embryo begins at stage 1 when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte and together they form a zygote.""
[england, marjorie a. life before birth. 2nd ed. england: mosby-wolfe, 1996, p.31]


""human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).
""fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. this fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.""
[moore, keith l. essentials of human embryology. toronto: b.c. decker inc, 1988, p.2]


""embryo: the developing organism from the time of fertilization until significant differentiation has occurred, when the organism becomes known as a fetus.""
[cloning human beings. report and recommendations of the national bioethics advisory commission. rockville, md: gpo, 1997, appendix-2.]


""embryo: an organism in the earliest stage of development; in a man, from the time of conception to the end of the second month in the uterus.""
[dox, ida g. et al. the harper collins illustrated medical dictionary. new york: harper perennial, 1993, p. 146]


""embryo: the early developing fertilized egg that is growing into another individual of the species. in man the term 'embryo' is usually restricted to the period of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of pregnancy.""
[walters, william and singer, peter (eds.). test-tube babies. melbourne: oxford university press, 1982, p. 160]


""the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[langman, jan. medical embryology. 3rd edition. baltimore: williams and wilkins, 1975, p. 3]


""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[considine, douglas (ed.). van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943]


""i would say that among most scientists, the word 'embryo' includes the time from after fertilization...""
[dr. john eppig, senior staff scientist, jackson laboratory (bar harbor, maine) and member of the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 31]


""the development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[sadler, t.w. langman's medical embryology. 7th edition. baltimore: williams &amp; wilkins 1995, p. 3]


""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""

""zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1]


""the chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and male pronuclei. these pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2n nucleus of the fertilized zygote. this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
[larsen, william j. human embryology. 2nd edition. new york: churchill livingstone, 1997, p. 17]


""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
[o'rahilly, ronan and mÔøΩller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. this textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}]


""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
[carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3]


""[a]nimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....
""[a] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the word embryo to describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. in its place, they proposed the term pre-embryo....
""i'll let you in on a secret. the term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by ivf practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. the new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients. 'don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. they won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

whether one capitalist maintains the risk or ten capitalists share the risk, it is the relationship of capitalist and laborer that creates the exploitation and theft of labor value.

stock owners are mini-capitalists. therefore, the stock allows the theft of labor value. this is simply self-evident.

true?  


thoughts?  


also,

just my two cents and i don't mind being downvoted as long as a few of you think about this, but,  


does everyone not realize citadel has 2 million shares of bbby and they have for a while?

  
so.... giving hedgies collateral and falling for the last play hedgies have to get collateral and over saturate and keep this fraud crime game going even longer.  


even if bbby is short, and a good or bad play.  


has anyone really not questioned the timing of this?  


gme splitvidend was basically screwed by the dtcc committing international security fraud.  


popcorn about to issue a share recall in the form of ape 1:1. (no dilution morons look it up so don't even bother replying with that slime bullshit.)  


yet now, right now, timing wise, shills been out in force and instead of the usual they're pumping bbby.  


making money? great, i'm not telling you what to do.  


but... think about why it's popping, why cramer is saying how short it is and ""can't believe how the shorts aren't doing anything to stop it before its the next gme"", etc, etc, blah blah  


(edit: those who hate popcorn and will comment, ""but cramer said maybe sticky floor is a good call after the interview he had with aa so popcorn is a swap because cramer repped popcorn"", nah. aa went out of his way to be the bigger man and ask apes to be nicer to cramer. whether you agree or disagree with that, doesn't matter. an example of why cramer laid off popcorn is because aa is the popular guy, he's the face, we apes are the rest of the school wanting to be cool. cramer felt picked on because we all, obviously, said he's a fuckin con artist bought and paid for. with aa going out of his way to say hey, leave him alone, is why cramer said like three good things about popcorn because he felt less bullied. i'm sure he'll be back to slapping popcorn soon enough.)

  
so save the fud, this is about what's going on with bbby i'm just clearing the air of some common misconceptions.  


citadel has 2+ million shares.  


what's 2 million times $23.08?  


collateral is what it is...  


so... do whatever you want.  


but i implore you to not just fuckin yolo before you do your homework because every fuckin aspect about this shit smells fishy and weird as hell to me.  


pretty frustrating. anyways.  


really, really great job for falling for this bbby bullshit in the 11th hour.  


even if you're making a bunch of money (great) have you ever stopped to ask why? why now? why, why, why?  


no? well.  


do your research and don't just hop on an obvious sham bandwagon.  


oh wait, all ya'll fuckin dumb dumbs are actually falling for it.  


citadel has 2 million shares of bbby.  


2+ milly.  


maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong.but if i'm right?

so all in all i would expect that about half of the grants were set at much higher prices, rsus are 40% of the average engineer's comp, and 50% of the rsu's value is lost due to market conditions, which means tc is perhaps 10% below target for this year and should correct soon.

true?  


thoughts?  


also,

just my two cents and i don't mind being downvoted as long as a few of you think about this, but,  


does everyone not realize citadel has 2 million shares of bbby and they have for a while?

  
so.... giving hedgies collateral and falling for the last play hedgies have to get collateral and over saturate and keep this fraud crime game going even longer.  


even if bbby is short, and a good or bad play.  


has anyone really not questioned the timing of this?  


gme splitvidend was basically screwed by the dtcc committing international security fraud.  


popcorn about to issue a share recall in the form of ape 1:1. (no dilution morons look it up so don't even bother replying with that slime bullshit.)  


yet now, right now, timing wise, shills been out in force and instead of the usual they're pumping bbby.  


making money? great, i'm not telling you what to do.  


but... think about why it's popping, why cramer is saying how short it is and ""can't believe how the shorts aren't doing anything to stop it before its the next gme"", etc, etc, blah blah  


(edit: those who hate popcorn and will comment, ""but cramer said maybe sticky floor is a good call after the interview he had with aa so popcorn is a swap because cramer repped popcorn"", nah. aa went out of his way to be the bigger man and ask apes to be nicer to cramer. whether you agree or disagree with that, doesn't matter. an example of why cramer laid off popcorn is because aa is the popular guy, he's the face, we apes are the rest of the school wanting to be cool. cramer felt picked on because we all, obviously, said he's a fuckin con artist bought and paid for. with aa going out of his way to say hey, leave him alone, is why cramer said like three good things about popcorn because he felt less bullied. i'm sure he'll be back to slapping popcorn soon enough.)

  
so save the fud, this is about what's going on with bbby i'm just clearing the air of some common misconceptions.  


citadel has 2+ million shares.  


what's 2 million times $23.08?  


collateral is what it is...  


so... do whatever you want.  


but i implore you to not just fuckin yolo before you do your homework because every fuckin aspect about this shit smells fishy and weird as hell to me.  


pretty frustrating. anyways.  


really, really great job for falling for this bbby bullshit in the 11th hour.  


even if you're making a bunch of money (great) have you ever stopped to ask why? why now? why, why, why?  


no? well.  


do your research and don't just hop on an obvious sham bandwagon.  


oh wait, all ya'll fuckin dumb dumbs are actually falling for it.  


citadel has 2 million shares of bbby.  


2+ milly.  


maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong.but if i'm right?

1660934684,"1. state where you are from and how you would label your political belief, maybe describe/define it shortly

i‚Äôm a left liberal pluralist from texas in the southern united states. essentially, i believe that capitalism (meaning the private accumulation of capital and generalized commodification of labor, goods and services freely exchanged) seems like a good way to maximize output and solve the local information and price signal problems, compared to centralized planning. it's up to us to direct that capitalism and use that output for social good.

economically, i‚Äôm a bit of a mess. neoclassical post keynesian? i‚Äôm socially generally left wing, but pluralist means i think all different types of people (trads, conservative muslims, etc) can live peacefully in liberal democracies. 


2. what is your story, how did you come to the political conclusions you believe nowadays?

trump's win pushed me hard to the left, but to be honest once you examine socialism, centralized planning, mandatory workers co-ops, etc., it‚Äôs all pretty demonstrably worse than capitalism+social programs. that being said, the goals of socialism (directing production for the good of society) are great, but at least for now you need some sort of capitalist system to get there. also, being a socialist let‚Äôs you sit back and say everything the democrats do is not good enough so you never have to vote or learn about actual policy; you sit around and throw rocks at capitalism while comparing it to an idealized socialist utopia that has either never existed (all workers co ops)*, was not great at meeting people's needs and wants in reality  (north korea, the soviet union), or is basically state capitalism with brutal authoritarianism (china). 

*workers co-ops are fine and can exist now. its ok to give them tax advantages and subsidize their financing, but turning every industry into a series of mandatory workers co ops (1) is not going to solve the ills of capitalism (the exxon workers co op is going to fight action on climate change); (2) is not the best way to organize every or even many industries efficiently; (3) can be done within capitalism on a voluntary basis; (4) cause all sorts of massive problems, such as inability to start businesses, inability to acquire capital at a reasonable cost, or even capital flight; (5) forces people to own and run a business that they do not want to (they may just want to be an employee, especially the first time they take an equity hit); and (6) aims to resolve issues that can be resolved via things like requiring labor/community representatives on the bod at a certain market cap. if workers co ops were highly profitable and everyone joined them, then we could naturally transition over. let‚Äôs not force it. 


3. in your opinion, what is the selling point of your political belief?

it‚Äôs possible. we are already kind of there, it‚Äôs just going to take more liberal and leftwing democrats to pass more policies getting us further. the new ira is a good example. it heavily incentivizes private investment into renewable energies in order to drive up capitalization of those industries and drive down prices, drive up efficiency, which is going to be necessary to decarbonize our economy. it does so without driving up energy (and all prices) and harming lower income folks in particular (something like outlawing gas or taxing it would do that). miraculous. if i were further left i might be a doomer about it and say ‚Äúwell ok it should really have passed 20 years ago‚Äù without appreciating what an accomplishment it is especially because democrats somehow got the joe manchin to endorse it. manchin is from a trump plus 30 state and is basically the senator of a coal company. 

in a more general sense, my philosophy tries to mix the best of both worlds. capitalism and free markets can unleash tremendous power and output. we as society need to decide how to distribute that output generated by capitalism and how to direct that capitalism for social good. i support strong social welfare programs, social provision of healthcare, food, child care, housing, etc.  nationalizing or partial nationalizing of certain industries might be appropriate, particularly when they become socially necessary (too big to fail)? social wealth funds like alaska‚Äôs are great. imagine a federally owned social wealth fund that owned all us equities and then used the cash generated to pay social dividends. it would give everyone a stake in american businesses doing well. when apple makes money, who cares? but when apple stock makes money and you as a social holder of apple stock benefit, that‚Äôs a win.",0,,Aryan_Jesus,0

if bed bath and beyond was going to go bankrupt, wouldn‚Äôt a drastic increase in price of their stock allow them to dilute (amc, anyone?) and raise capital to prevent this? jimmy shill was screaming this on twitter, and yet bbby didn‚Äôt dilute. which seems like that would be a breach of fiduciary duties for their shareholders. ‚Äúnah, we‚Äôre not gonna raise capital at an opportune time, we‚Äôre just going to file for bankruptcy.‚Äù yeah fucking right. no ceo buys 50000 shares two months ago, ignores an opportunity to fix their balance sheet with dilution at an opportune time, and then releases a statement about their agreement with rc ventures back in march. none of that is logical. 

speculation, but my guess is that rc made a contingency offer on bye bye baby, saying he would buy it for x amount on x date unless a well qualified buyer gave them a better offer, hence why the cfo and rc both sold off shares at an agreed upon date in august. and by rc making the offer, i believe it will be under the gme kids or gmerica umbrella. the reason this speculation makes sense is the couple 700,000 square foot warehouses gamestop has made operational across the country, and while i‚Äôm no expert, seems like there would be ample room to warehouse a lot more inventory than just video games and funko toys. have you ever been to a gamestop? none of their products that they sell are huge and take up a ton of space by any means. logistically, overhead by adding these products, especially since rc is an e commerce connoisseur with the warehousing and distribution already in place, means low added overhead and high potential with profit from a company that is hyper focused on delighting customers. just look at the stories of chewy‚Äôs customer service and rc‚Äôs quotes about his dad‚Äôs advice.

the fact that there is so much fud from msm, and radio silence from rc, on top of this making sense from a business perspective, offers, imho, the best logical explanation for what the fuck is going on.

edit: ugh, have to edit this because this doesn‚Äôt even include talking about why rc rug pulling retail goes against literally everything this guy has stood for for the past two years. he‚Äôs obviously good with risk, and i think he was willing to risk his reputation in the short term (two weeks of being dragged through the mud or so) and when the announcement comes, reddit will explode in a collective orgasm for him, and jim cramer will literally lose the rest of his hair {let‚Äôs be honest, if i was a hair on his head i‚Äôd get the fuck out, too.})

also, for those who don‚Äôt know, rc is the largest individual shareholder of apple stock. yes, that apple stock. in one of his interviews post his sale of chewy, he mentions that he is approached all of the time to invest in companies and he says no. the only two other holdings he‚Äôs ever had afaik are gamestop and bbby. do you honestly think he‚Äôd purposely fuck up his reputation on this for a tiny profit compared to his net worth. this motherfucker is way smarter than that.

long story short, occam‚Äôs razor literally screams that there‚Äôs something massive coming that will delight the fuck out of shareholders, and i‚Äôll eat my hat if that isn‚Äôt for both shareholders of gme and bbby. out.",13,,NoFox_Giveth,1

makro outlook i dalje ostaje isti nista se drasticno nije promenilo. fed govnornici daju do znanja da je inflacija i price stability glavni problem a ne recesija, i da su spremni da odvedu ekonomiju u istu. 
medjutim sada je pitanje da li ce rate hikes trajati premalo i da ce efekat biti nedovoljan, a s druge strane ako preteraju, morace da pivot. sto me dovodi do zanimljivog grafikona ispod. svaki put kada je fed pivot, suprotno misljenju da je ‚Äúbuy time‚Äù, ekonomija je vec bila u recesiji.

not in the sense that delusional, ignorant pro-choicers want them to be. parents have special responsibilities to their children, and they typically aren't allowed to kill them, even if they really really want to. i can think of a scenario where a mother would be forced to at least try to breastfeed her child, if the alternative means the child would starve. you do not typically have the option exercise your ""right to bodily autonomy and security"" if that action harms or kills your child, and you yourself are not in grave danger.",0,,keyesloopdeloop,0

2. real inflation is easily at around 15%, while interest rates are/will be at a max of around 2/3%. selling your google position to get a -12% return per year?? that's fucking insane to me. yes, you can argue all the other assets have lost much more than 12%, but that's due to the markets panicking and anticipating a very aggressive move from the fed that simply cannot happen.

1661090510,"&gt;that's like saying money laundering is fine because it's part of the economy.

no. money laundering is a harmful activity. speculation is not.

&gt;speculative assets are assets that are over valued. they have a tendency to tank the economy when the shoe drops and everyone realises their speculative asset is not worth the price they paid for it. e.g. current property crisis in china, e.g us property crisis that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. e.g. (and this is really going in to economics history) the tulip mania crisis in the 17th century. all speculative assets are a ticking time bomb, all non-productive assets are a waste of resources.

that's not true. you're talking about bubbles. not all speculation is related to bubbles. speculation is simply the purchase of an asset that is expected to change in value in the near future. that doesn't mean it's *over*valued, though. if i buy some apple stock, expecting apple to launch a new, popular product and then apple does, raising the value of their stock is not now overvalued. they have secured a new revenue source, which means their company is more valuable.

&gt;no, they are sitting a digital scrooge mcduck money pile - if you converted elon musk's 240 billion net worth into gold coin, it wouldn't fit in uncle scrooge's vault.

but it's not in gold coin. it's in spacex and tesla stock. by investing in spacex and tesla, musk ensures that those companies have cash to finance their business activity. that means they can employ people, they can buy things from other companies that also employ people.

musk isn't just sitting on a pile of money. his money is invested in companies that enageg in productive enterprise.

&gt;here's the thing, if you do economics and/or study how rich people get rich, they \*don't\* invest it, the rate of return is too low. in the modern economy, wealth attracts more wealth, without the wealthy having to do anything. that's what they mean by ""get your money to earn for you"".  
&gt;  
&gt;no this is not a correlation vs causation moment - it's just called economics.

you don't know the first thing about economics.

simply leaving your money in the bank to accrue interest is a terrible strategy for accumulating wealth. the rate of return for that is even lower. that is not how the rich manage their money. the vast majority of their wealth is invested in companies and funds. if you think the vast majority of billionaires' wealth is held in the form of liquid cash or physical property then you are so unbelievably ignorant of the subject that you have no business commenting on it. you certainly have no business trying to present yourself as some sort of authority on it.

&gt;every country in any time period in any location on the planet that has become a wealthy one has done so via 1. investing in public education 2. investing in infrastructure (i.e. productive assets) 3. enabling a shift of people from lower class to the middle class (which is where most of the economic activity takes place.  
&gt;  
&gt;whereas all countries that have had their economies collapse have done so after a concentration of wealth in a small elite. no country has ever got rich via tax cuts and subsidies for the wealthy.  
&gt;  
&gt;economists are generally have a better grasp of economics than politicians. politicians tell you the story you want to hear, economists just tell you how it is.

(for the conspiratorially-minded among us, pelosi unexpectedly visited taiwan on august 2, setting off an international dustup. to some extent, this has had the effect of forcing american chipmakers' stock prices further downward during an already rough run this year, though it hasn't been a massive drop. it's possible that paul pelosi anticipated his wife's visit having more effect on his holdings than it did, and sold at a loss thinking that he was forestalling even deeper losses in the immediate future.)",75,,allthesemonsterkids,0

spy is actually rebalanced quarterly so they only rebalance 4 times a year. the reason it changes so much is because you can imagine an etf like a portfolio. you may start of with 10% apple stock, but if aapl outperforms the rest of the stocks in the portfolio, then apple will become a larger part of the portfolio and after a year or two aapl is maybe 20% of your portfolio, even though you didn't change anything. this of course works in the other way too, if aapl crashes -50% then it will be a signicantly less portion of your portfolio.

so the constant change is due to the change in stock prices changing the value of the given holdings, and this can be quite apparent if for example the tech sector has a very bullish week and the healthcare has a hugely bearish week.",11,,MamamYeayea,0

1661171124,"you have to learn about nominal value and real value.

if you buy apple stock (or a diversified basket of many different securities) and its price does not move, but chf goes up, you get less nominal chf when selling.

that would mean the same amount of chf buys more apple stock and also more milk, more meat, more property, more energy, more bread, more clothes. everyone holding chf is richer.

but it doesn't because swiss companies have to pay their employees in chf, and swiss exports are sold for ‚Ç¨ and usd so unless swiss exports are increasing in value, you get less chf for your exports, but still have to pay employees and taxes in chf. people hoding ‚Ç¨ or usd can afford less swiss products if priced in chf and not becoming cheaper.

that means either swiss salaries gown down, productivity goes up or chf must go down in value.

if you know chf will not go down in value, you should bet on swiss stock because swiss productivity will go up, or prepare for your salaries to go down. salaries are not allowed to go down unless there's massive unemployment. that is why central banks react to unemployment by correcting exchange rates.

over the long term, unless there's a huge productivity improvement, the difference in exchange rate should not be meaningful.

in the short term if you want to benefit from exchange rates changes, then you should invest in currency maybe short term government bonds. stocks are for the long term where exchange rates are just noise.",2,,ivanreddit,0

we don't need to rely on canada's data, because late abortions happen in the us as well. here's an actual knowledge drop. according to arizona's data, which is the best data i know of, only a small fraction of later abortions are performed due to the health of either the mother or the fetus.

in this case, looking at abortions that occurred at 21 weeks or later.

[here's the 2020 report.](https://azdhs.gov/documents/preparedness/public-health-statistics/abortions/2020-arizona-abortion-report.pdf)

*tldr: in arizona, in 2020, at most 10% of abortions performed at 21 weeks or later were due to medical conditions of either the mother or fetus.*

- in 2020, there were 13,273 abortions performed in arizona (page 4)

- there were 169 abortions performed at 21+ weeks (page 17, table 10)

- fewer than six 21+ week abortions were performed due to maternal medical conditions. values under 6 are suppressed. (page 14, table 7)

- twelve 21+ week abortions were performed due to fetal medical conditions. (page 15, table 8)

**so, at most, 17 of the 169 21+ week abortions were performed due to medical conditions of either the mother or fetus.**

1661277546,"&gt; pair anarchy with privacy and bad things come. bad actors can not be punished. this is not freedom this is chaos.

and you know that because ...? where is any substance for your claim? why would you think bad actors can not be punished in anarchy? that's completely false coming from ignorance. if you are interested i can recommend a book or two so that you can understand the topic.

&gt; bitcoiners need the distinction and i can understand and respect that.   
however on an higher level you gotta consider other cryptos like consequences of this ''wave'' of technology and way of thinking about money. bitcoin is vulnerable to all of the movement that it has created. dominance will keep going down leaving new opportunities for more blatant and more unsustainable projects.

quite a bad take. that's like saying that amazon or google or other internet successes are somehow responsible for all the early internet failures and scams. are you saying that just because a part of the technology stack being used in two completely different applications means that those applications are somehow connected? this is not how it works. the ""dominance"" is a nonsense metric. why would anyone put something like usdt in the same table as bitcoin so that it affects its ""dominance"" number? why don't you put apple stock in the same table? do you think mobile phones from apple do not use the very same cryptography as bitcoin?

&gt; are you even serious? even if that was true which is not without the help of scaling solutions (additional layers that sacrifice security) that's not even a relevant point. paypal works and it doesn't need much else to do so.

what you mean that it is not true? how much do you think you can use paypal in iraq, iran, lybia, pakistan (and 15-20 others)? but even in non-sanctioned countries, paypal accounts of businesses and individuals have been closed for political and other reasons. are you saying this is not happening or what do you mean that it is not true?

&gt; is this how you bank the unbanked? you get them to buy miners and spend money for electricity? great plan! do you understand how improbable this is? the unbanked don't have money to buy food and they should bother investing the little they have to buy a volatile asset like btc? and by the way. nobody is using btc to pay for stuff. nobody is accepting it. you still need fiat for everything and in order to do that you must use a cex and then a bank. crypto solves nothing

can you quote where i'm talking about mining at all? or have you just ignored what i wrote because it does not fit to your agenda?

also because you don't know anyone who accepts bitcoin it does not mean there is not quite a huge market with it. i'm buying stuff with bitcoin for many years, including stuff from amazon. so you are just ignorant of real world and instead of learning about the topic, or asking someone, you just create and spread this fud.

&gt; currency is not supposed to generate revenue at all. 

is this not exactly what i wrote?

&gt;  just because the dollar has become a trust based currency ,doesn't mean that the governments do nothing but steal.

here you are correct. there is no such implication. that ""the governments do nothing but steal"" is half of what governments do, but it does not come from the currency thing. the other half is that they give what they stole to someone. and that's then really all they do.

&gt; i would argue we live in a constantly improving world even though we are going trough tough times right now and maybe for some years ahead.

on longer time scale i agree, you are just mistaken that it is because of democracy and government. in fact, this is despite the democracy and government and because of the capitalism.
 
&gt; democracy has given birth to amazing cities, economies and cultures.

no, it did not.

&gt; what is the bitcoin culture? f**k everybody let's boycott the government? democracy is not perfect but it's the best we got.

maybe just read the article i linked before that i wrote about the democracy. or read some book, if you want i can give you some recommendations. democracy is certainly not perfect but it's certainly not best we got.

and yes, part of the bitcoin culture is fuck the government, but not fuck everybody else, that's quite contrary to it. it's more like fuck government and government only and voluntarily and freely transact with people on the market.

&gt;&gt; this is a good thing. money laundering is a good thing.

&gt; by this point i'm left speechless...

it seems ridiculous to you, right? you have a long journey in front of you if it does. and it's up to you if you choose to go there. but try to thing about - what is the actual crime? why would you think money laundering is a bad thing? there is no dirty money, there is just money and then there is crime. punish the crime, don't punish people (even by spying on them) just because they might commit a crime. every real crime in the world can be punished without money laundering to be a thing.",2,,only_merit,0

so when you hear someone price anchor to these specific points, understand where the hf pain will be. 

during the aapl squeezes in the late oughts, i had some leap calls for $300 or $350, but i have know idea what that price is in today's dollars because of all the splits, i think it was about $4.5. from the red line ""float traded"" charts yesterday, it appears that aapl stock squoze for about 15 years and is only now returning to some kind of normalcy.

no one is going to remember what the prices were, or when they sold. they'll just have regret.

our moass could just be bbby being an abnormally buoyant stock for the next few decades. and these price anchoring points will just be some pennies down at the bottom of a massive stable climb.

1661280865,"here is your actual allocations:
67% us market cap

5% canada market cap

5% international market cap

5% emerging markets market cap

17% air canada

6% t-mobile


i assume you have good reasons for air canada and t-mobile, so i won't comment on that. one thing you might want to do is set aside a certain percentage for buying individual stocks so that you don't go nuts, and can have some fun trying to pick companies in that narrow sleeve.

in terms of assets, that's 100% stocks, completely non-diversified.

in terms of index method, you have 100% market cap, then your two individual stocks. completely non-diversified. pretty concentrated in the us, but at least you have some global exposure.

everyone here says go 100% stocks, but that's frankly just plain stupid. consider 2000-2010, that's an entire decade where a 100% stock allocation will have you losing money. there is no way you'd stick with your allocation through an entire decade of losing money.

you need diversifiers from different asset classes. bonds, commodities, etc. simply having different stocks is not diversification.

you also have all your stocks concentrated in market cap indexes. these are the worst kind of index, since they overweight what's already gotten big. do you want to buy apple stock in 2022 when it's the biggest company, or in 1997?

equal weight is better, but you should be diversifying across factors too. so you want value to get those 1997 apples, but also momentum. market cap is kind of like shitty momentum, so why not go for actual momentum? why own apple after it's gone up, when you could own it only while it is going up? low volatility is also good, as are indexes that focus on smaller and quality companies. diversify how your stocks indexes are created.

then within your stocks, i assume you're just buying and holding. this means you're 100% short volatility, which means when the next crash happens, all of your positions are going to drop. that's when you'll panic sell and make your terrible allocations even worse.

so in sum, you've created an extremely concentrated, non-diversified portfolio that you'll likely have trouble sticking to because it could have extremely long periods of decline combined with extremely sharp drawdowns.

so you need to diversify across asset classes, and across index strategies at the very least.

what you have is:

100% all in on one asset class.

100% all in on one indexing method.

100% all in on one strategy (buy and hold).

100% all in on one volatility class.

100% all in on one economic cycle (growth).


what to do:
first do what you're saying and don't have copies of the same etf.

second, change up some of your stock indexes to add at least value and momentum based indexes. 

add some diversifying asset classes. bonds, commodities, alternatives.

add some different strategies, look into things like risk parity, trend following, or global macro to add some diversity.

pay attention to volatility, get something that will go up when the next crash hits and everything else is plummeting. this will help you stay the course when you at least have something that is going up when everything else is plummeting.

consider other economic regimes, everyone looks at the last 10 years and says 100% stocks but from 2008-2020 was a growth cycle. consider what does well during periods of inflation, deflation, recession. you'll find in those situations 100% stocks, which do awesome during growth periods, start to look like a terrible strategy.

save your concentrated bets for your stock picking sleeve, and let the rest of your portfolio be highly diversified so that you can survive any conditions.

my parents were not wealthy. my father is a dead beat who never worked and gaslight my mother and beat my siblings and i. my oldest sister had to call the cops of him too many times to keep him from shooting us when he took out his guns to threaten us. i was anti-gun for a long time because of this, but recently changed my tune with so much crime occurring in less affluent areas.  my mother worked 2 full-time jobs and one part-time. two full time was for 35 and 26 years respectively. the part-time was for 15 years. she retired but works on software jobs to keep herself active. she almost committed suicide a few times when we were younger but knew nobody would care for us as much.

she never spent on herself. her retirement pays out $360k a year from her pension plans and shes got about $3 million in aapl stock which was mostly luck as it was the only stock outside of retirement accounts she ever bought and never sold- she did this by taking out a loan on the house so it was very risky since she had no money at the time but knew she had to invest outside of retirement accounts.  i have more than a dozen siblings so you can imagine how hard it was to raise us when my father basically did nothing but party with other women.

&gt;these tanks received the product code ""object 184"". while it is certainly quite confusing for one model of tank to have two product codes, this was not unprecedented. the t-72a was accepted into service in 1979 under the product code of object 172m-1, but the code object 176 was also used despite the fact that the actual object 176 was merely an experimental tank used as a testbed for various technologies that were eventually implemented in the t-72 series. in particular, the t-72av was given the code object 176v; there is no object 172m-1v.",6,,Sadukar09,0

&gt;the research and design work on the further improvement of t-72a tanks was done under the research topic of ""—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç-72–∞"" (""**improved t-72a**""). the tanks created in 1983 and 1984 are therefore most accurately referred to as ""improved t-72a"" tanks. this term is used in several russian articles, and the tanks are referred to as such by n.a. molodnyakov in the collection of memoirs ""life given to tanks"" dedicated to the ukbtm chief designer v.n venediktov, published in 2010.

&gt;these tanks received the product code ""object 184"". while it is certainly quite confusing for one model of tank to have two product codes, this was not unprecedented. the t-72a was accepted into service in 1979 under the product code of object 172m-1, but the code object 176 was also used despite the fact that the actual object 176 was merely an experimental tank used as a testbed for various technologies that were eventually implemented in the t-72 series. in particular, the t-72av was given the code object 176v; there is no object 172m-1v.",2,,Sadukar09,0

the criteria have to be up to you.  what would be a good stock for you?  how about aapl?  would you be ok holding aapl stock for a few months if it took that long to recover?  think about blue chip stocks as a good starting point as they tend to not drop as much, and can recover sooner.

if you hire the right people and run a tight ship, set a clear vision and achievable but ambitious goals with a road map to do so, and those people you hire for each department are hiring people with the same attitude and vision and attention for detail. man. 

then you pay those people good money and they love working for you, and they feel like what they do matters, like they're a part of something. man. that's what i been trying to see ever since the new rc crew took over. setting up a structure of incentives to be a competitive employer in the retail, tech and corporate space that can net gme the best talent and continue their multifaceted growth is what i'm about.

gme's future? bullish. 

everybody buckled up? here's a thought:


you need a job, you were thinking something local, probably retail, somewhere in the mall. given all this, i see a massive paradigm shift where gamestop may now stack up somewhere around working at the apple store. (*mic drop emoji) . i see that off this move because one of the key things about working at apple is they offer their stock purchase plan that automatically puts 10% of your paycheck into apple stock at a 15% discount to market price. fucking amazing. they offer 401ks and iras. to be fair, this isn't all that, *yet*. this is the start of gamestop building a similar employee base, and a similar position as an employer in the retail space. sick . mental. bullish as all hell.

i see a future where gme is a more desirable job than the apple store. wtf you think is gonna happen when the stock vesting stuff they just announced is still in place after moass? does everyone apply? i think so. does every good hire you have right now stay for life? i think so. have they already had a couple years to shape up the company, restructure every level from management to the sales floor? i think so.

1661383709,"there are three types of possible ways to get money with a mutual fund, or with an etf. either way, it's a collection of stocks. 

(a) dividends, which are a form of profit sharing from stocks. about half or 60% of stocks pay dividends. chevron or home depot earns a profit, so they distribute a small bit of it to every stock holder.  most mutual funds will have some dividend payout. this is also known as the 'yield', which is described as a percentage. a 1.6% yield means for every $100 invested in the fund it will pay about $1.60 in dividends per year. 

(b) capital gains, which is when the fund manager sells assets within the fund. maybe they decide to sell part of their microsoft stock, for whatever reason. they sit on this cash for a while, and distribute some of it back to those who hold the fund. 

either way, you can take the dividends &amp; capital gains as cash, or you can re-invest it back into the fund. if it's in a retirement account there are not taxes on any of this, but you're taxed on both dividends and capital gains in a regular brokerage account. 

(c) you can also sell mutual funds, like the others said ... you buy for $100 per share, a few years later it goes up to $120 per share. you earned a $20 profit per share. 

there are periods of time when the stock market is doing so-so that dividends will be your main  source of growth with investing, so they're an important part of the mix.",2,,nostratic,0

&gt;‚Äúdespite a sharp 40%/30%/25% 2022/23/24e eps cut on gaming, we maintain our long-held thesis that the stock remains a data center story with major auto inflection next year‚Ä¶ remain buy rated on secular ai growth and competitive moat,‚Äù malik said in a client note.

&gt;bernstein analyst stacy rasgon said the results were ‚Äúweak‚Äù but expected. he is especially positive on the nvda stock given that much of the overall risk is already priced in.

&gt;‚Äúwhile the results were a bit breathtaking (and not in a good way), we don't think we necessarily hate the way this is turning out. it is clear the company is under shipping gaming by a substantial amount. datacenter is holding in well with china de-risked. automotive is inflecting. we should never have to worry about a crypto cycle ever again. and as the dust settles we have two brand-new product cycles set to kick off within the next quarter or two. so investors looking for a de-risked profile have much to grab onto,‚Äù rasgon explained to investors in a note.

lucked out that another company had a ceo that was on the board of trustees at my alma mater and so when looking for new employees came to alum first and just liked whatever he saw on my very mediocre resume. 3 years later the company is struggling and they let go an old manager so i replaced them to ""bring in new ideas"" even though i knew nothing about that org function.  a few months later, as a manager, i get wind that we've got like 3 months before bankruptcy. 

since i had some time i shot my resume to all my moonshot companies and low and behold, one was looking for exactly the role that i had only been 6 months into. 

i jumped ship and it turned out to be one of those ""if i could go back in time..i'd buy apple stock"".

1661474871,"they‚Äôve moved the estimated share value to $22 a share, or $88 pre split, for a company they said was as good as dead a year ago i‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty damn
convincing. they are making moves into e commerce, they are expanding from just video games into game merch and other toys. there was a time we joked about selling used games but that used to be a huge portion of their profits, now that they are selling more than just games it expands their profit making abilities, since new games have a very low margin of profitability. 

i‚Äôm not going to sit here and screem ryan cohen is daddy, or what so have you about gamestop, i‚Äôm an avid believer in them, and have been in the game pre 21 sneeze, but fundamentals wise, i‚Äôm really liking their direction. from the nft market place(which has huge profitability on their side) to the merchandise expansions of their stores(seriously go check one out), so far every move they‚Äôve made not only seems like it‚Äôs grabbing a relatively uncharted market, but it‚Äôs doing it well. gamestop has become less about just video games and more about the gamer, at least in terms of products offered.  i think within the next 5 years gamestop, or whatever conglomerate it becomes, is going to be a well known name, and not just because of a stock squeeze. 
with the excitement my son gets going into gamestop, and he‚Äôs too young for video games, i could imagine a future where they become the next ‚Äútoys r us‚Äù so to speak, or a place for games and toys in general.  i can‚Äôt argue that atm they are in the beginning stages, so it‚Äôs hard to really pin down anything specific that makes them great just yet, but once the ball starts rolling, it won‚Äôt stop. 
what‚Äôs to come will be amazing, everyone would have loved to have bought apple stock back in 06, but if you heard the people making macs we‚Äôre going to try to compete with microsoft in the mobile phone world would you have thought it was a good investment? yet here we are. 

we‚Äôve got a very big recession/depression/economic collapse on the horizon, try as we might i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre getting out of this one. it‚Äôs what‚Äôs to come after this though, that will shape the future.

the comments about gpu being down in the earnings call was for it to be down ""a couple quarters or so"". 

another comment said something about expecting gpus to go up with lovelace in 23(calander, not fiscal, since they are on q3 fy 23 already).

they didnt use the word digestion, just sell in and sell through, but what i got out of it is its going to take at least 2 or 3 quarters for the channel to digest the excess inventory before they can get their sell in back up to sell through.

the jist i got was they are expecting their gpu segment to be depressed for at least 2 and probably 3 quarters.

on top of that i have a feeling they hid(or lumped) some of their crypto sales into datacenter. 'datacenter' could be depressed more then expected because of that as well.

with the mood in the q2 earnings call, and their lack of any guidance for the q4 or revised guidance for the year.....i don't think q4 is going to be very good. i'm not even sure q1 fy24 will be very good for them.

don't take the above as investing advice. just saying it seems like its going to take them at minimum 2 or 3 quarters to work through their current issues. its also unlikely that there will be another crypto boom to pick up the slack form etherium going proof of stake either, i think they are looking at their baseline being reset a few billion lower. 

there could be a massive title wave of cards on the horizon hitting the used market, if so this is going to hurt nvidia more then amd. the current hash rate still mining etherium will go somewhere. i don't think any of the other coins can adsorb it, i think its going to crash onto the used market.

2.) there will be fluctuations in your tsp, but also steady growth. the tsp is based on the economy, when the economy does good so does the tsp, when it does bad so does the tsp. don‚Äôt worry about fluctuation too much, as historically the economy always goes up over a period of time. go look up microsoft stock right now. look at how it fluctuated in the last day. now look at the last month. now look at the last 5 years. you‚Äôll notice that although it has constant dips and spikes, it steadily increases over time.",1,,Acceptable_Light_557,0
1661513596,"&gt;personally, i think one of its best use cases is company stock.

as a software engineer, this seems unlikely. blockchains are good for de-centralization and security. stock markets require transactions per second, not seconds per transaction. they need speeds that no blockchain can achieve without a less centralized, less secure layer sitting on top of it.

it would definitely be nice to have more transparency and security in the market, but (as much as i would love to see hft and dark pools go away) blockchains are simply too slow. also, we already tried icos. how did that work out? think of how many bored apes have been stolen by hackers versus major blocks of amazon or apple stock.

everything has changed in the mean time but people still are the weakest link, i've had customers at a company i worked for that wanted a and b as the account name and password for the domain admin at their small company because anything else was too much typing. locking the account after one minute also was deemed a hassle and they had to be able to use rdp from everywhere without any annoying firewall &amp; token authentication or vpn. they got infected by a cryptolocker a few times before they reconsidered but my boss was the real prick for allowing them to do this because it took us more billable hours to get this fixed and replace all encrypted files with a good backup then just implement a secure solution for 1 time.

1661537476,"i hear you, but here's the ""corporate hr"" line from when i worked hr: incentives.

most non-store lead retail staff aren't going to be lifers like store leads are. would it be good to pay them more? always.

it's also worth noting - if all employees got this, how will dedicated store leads feel?

there's a lot more at play. but ultimately, i agree with you.

that said, maybe this is the start. rewarding your tenured employees is a standard play. hopefully stock options for ft retail and then maybe even pt retail will follow.

i got apple stock options as a pt apple employee, but it was at a dramatic cut from what senior associates and managers earned. which is normal. even if your base compensation is adequate for retail, you need to reward your leaders more to keep them motivated.

it's naively idealalistic to think employees won't notice if they're being rewarded at the same rate as others who don't put as much time or work in. 

compensation is a difficult formula at best. gamestop offering stock options even to store leaders is bringing it closer to getting to an apple-level of ability to add stock options for everyone.

you can't expect them to make sweeping changes on a whim. it's not how business works.",1,,shinynewcharrcar,0
1661539268,"&gt; according to researchers b.e. zhilyaev, v.n. petukhov, and v.m. reshetnyk, the main astronomical observatory of nas of ukraine ‚Äúconducts an independent study of uap‚Äù which has managed to collect imagery depicting several anomalous aerial events. the team says it employs a pair of meteor stations located in kyiv and in the vinarivka village, each fitted with video cameras observing the daytime sky.

&gt; based on the events they have observed, they break down their observations of uap into two primary categories, which they call ‚Äúcosmics‚Äù and ‚Äúphantoms.‚Äù

&gt;‚Äúwe note that cosmics are luminous objects, brighter than the background of the sky,‚Äù the authors write, noting three subcategories of cosmics each named after various birds: swift, falcon, and eagle, whereas ‚Äúphantoms are dark objects, with contrast from several to about 50 percent.‚Äù

&gt;the ukrainian team says they have detected uap under a variety of conditions and have observed what they characterize as ‚Äúa significant number of objects whose nature is not clear.‚Äù

&gt; flights of single, group and squadrons of the ships were detected,‚Äù the paper states, with several of the objects exhibiting speeds ‚Äúfrom 3 to 15 degrees per second‚Äù and varying degrees of brightness that the team gauges within a range of 10 to 20 hz. the research team also employed synchronized camera systems that in one instance, according to their paper, ‚Äúallowed the detection of a variable object, at an altitude of 1170 km.‚Äù

&gt; ‚Äúphantoms are observed in the troposphere at distances up to 10 ‚Äì 12 km,‚Äù the researchers state in the paper, estimating their size as being between 3 and 12 meters and capable of speeds of as much as 15 kilometers per second.

&gt; unidentified anomalous, air, and space objects are deeply concealed phenomena,‚Äù the authors conclude, adding that the primary characteristic of the uap they have observed is ‚Äúextremely high speed.‚Äù

using today's closing prices.

* your position:  sell $aapl short at $163.62, sell the 9/2 162.5p for $2.04, buy 170c for $0.50.  net option credit of $1.54.
* same exposure:  sell 9/2 162.5c for $3.30, buy the 170c for $0.50, net credit of $2.80

the difference is close to the intrinsic value between the current stock price and the atm strike ($163.62-$162.50 = $1.12) on your position, but you have less slippage with the call vertical.

this is a bearish strategy.  max profit is $2.80, max loss is $4.70.

1661614666,"**i still believe in the long term $nvda story.** 

these are the negatives that will create an opportunity to buy on declines.($120 to $150)

1)the lack of ethereum mining pounds gpu's used for mining - **that market is gone.**

2) a crypto winter ensures used gpu cards being returned to the market and sinking asp's.

3) gaming inventory will take at least 2-3 quarters to clear.

as a result, nvda's fy jan 2023 eps will be closer to $3.5, a huge drop over fy 2022.

looking forward is key to buying this company on declines and owning this stock for the next 3-5 years.

data center overtook gaming for the 1st time in 2022. 

my estimate for data center for fy jan 2023 is 16,300 growing 53% yoy and about 7,800 for gaming, a drop of 38%. 

my revenue estimates for the next 2 years are as under.

|**eps**|**5.00**|**43%**|**6.50**|**30%**|

nvda's fy jan 2023 eps will be closer to $3.5! terrible! but crypto did earn them a lot when the going was good..no point crying about a market that's disappeared.

more importantly, i expect $nvda to earn $5 per share in fy jan 24 and $6.5 in fy jan 2025. 

i'll start accumulating in 20% increments below $150; given current market conditions after powell's hawkish speech, the stock could tank to $120.

1661619085,"hi.  one of your comments suggests you're not from the us?  where are you from?

""the stock market"" is not actually a thing... there are actually stock markets.  back in the day, a stock market worked something like this:  there were known locations within the market building where stock could be exchanged for money.  the market was really a way for a potential buyer and potential seller to come together and agree to a price.  as things got bigger, it became more automated and eventually computerized.

stock are shares of ownership in a company.  if you own 100 shares of apple computer, inc, for example, you own a tiny slice of the company.  in the worst case, if the company goes out of business, after debts are paid off, their assets would be sold, and shareholders would get cash for their share of the company.

so ""the stock market"" is really just the way that people buy and sell tiny slices of companies.

as an investor in apple, you tie your fortunes to apple...to some extent.  if you invest $1000 in shares of apple stock, then the value will go up and down as different buyers and sellers of apple stock, on the stock market, agree to a price.  

some companies pay ""dividends"" -- those are a cut of the profits that the company chooses to give back to its shareholders.  for a long time, apple did not pay divide.  nds, instead choosing to spend their profits in other ways.  

so why buy stock in a company?  because ultimately you think you'll profit from that stock.  but very often it doesn't work out, or it takes a long time to work out.  i remember thinking about buying apple stock when it was trading around $23.  those were the dark days when steve jobs wasn't associated with the company.  or maybe he'd just returned.  i had no faith in the company surviving, and although i prefer macintosh computers over pcs, i did not want to risk my money by investing in apple.  seeing how much more that money would be worth, i wish i had felt different...but given my belief, the decision not to by was the correct decision.

a long time ago (at least 80 years), people started pooling their money together for the purpose of buying stock.  those associations would buy stock in multiple different companies, for the *mutual* benefit of all the shareholders of the pool.  those are now known as **mutual funds**",1,,micha8st,0

1661646752,"they certainly can be. here‚Äôs something you should look at - not financial advice. 

you have 100 shares of $msft (options contracts are in shares of 100). $msft closed at $268 on friday. 

when the market opens you could buy a put contact for the right to sell 100 shares of $msft at a set strike price. the options contract will list the per share price so multiply by 100.

my recommendation if your worried about retaining profit would be to use a put contract like insurance. 

you could buy a put for jan 20, 2023 (all options contracts have an expiration date, you can exercise anytime until then unless you buy a european option but you won‚Äôt cuz ‚Äòmurica) with a strike of say $250.

that means that anytime between now and jan of 23 you can sell your 100 shares for $250 per share. locking in your profit. 

however there will be a significant premium for doing this - nobody on wall street is your friend. you have to pay for the privilege. 

so i think you look at your cost basis and find an acceptable strike price, factoring in the cost of the contract. you should be able to figure out how to protect some of your profits. or - you‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs too expensive to do so and you make a decision about selling or holding the underlying shares. 

unfortunately, everyone and their mom thinks shares are going down so the premium for an options context at or near ‚Äúthe money‚Äù (near the current trading price) will probably cost so much money your profit will evaporate in contract costs. 

the options contract itself has intrinsic value and if the market is liquid enough you can sell your contract back to the market before it expires to either recoup losses on the premium (if the price goes up) or to make a tidy profit if the price goes down. 

people talk a lot about options trading to make money but it‚Äôs very hard. you have to guess the market direction correctly, and time the market correctly, and you have to have cash or share to exercise the contract or the options market has to be liquid enough to sell into it. 

if you don‚Äôt have a round number of shares (increments of 100) using the put contract as a form of insurance isn‚Äôt realistic. 

that‚Äôs how an options contract could be favorable to you, this is not financial advice. do your own research.",1,,bluemasonjar,0

lets say you want to buy 1 share of apple for $100 even, and you place the order using webull. webull sends that trade to the market maker, in this case its citadel. citadel gives you an iou for 1 share of apple. well citadel sits on that obligation for anywhere between 2 days to 31 days, where they will create thousands of ious for other apple stock holders, who also bought at $100. when they accumulate enough ious, they short the apple to drive the price down to lets say $93, buy up all those ious they owe, close their shorts bringing the price back up, then create fake media articles to justify the price swing. citadel profits $7 off every share that retail bought, plus they profit from the shorts they opened and closed, and pays webbull and robinhood a slice of their profits for the trades. while you and every other apple investor lost $7 a share on their investment.

its all a rigged game, thats why its important to buy and hold long term, because the system has been rigged for decades. this all happens behind the scenes away from public eye. if you're curious, look up ""failure to deliver"", or ftds thats what they call the ious. every stock on the market has these ftds, and they they go into the millions per stock, per day.",1,,SM1334,0

1661722034,"**whatever the crisis, republicans want another tax cut for the rich--why?**
-----
how republicans made millions on the tax cuts they pushed through congress

----

when apple stock hit a then-record high in october 2018, among the shareholders counting their gains were 43 republicans in congress, who collectively owned as much as $1.5 million worth of the tech giant‚Äôs shares.

apple‚Äôs stock jumped 37 percent in its runup to that record. several variables were behind the climb, including higher-than-expected earnings. but congressional republicans themselves had a hand in the spike, stock analysts say. legislation they championed ‚Äî the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ‚Äî doled out nearly $150 billion in corporate tax savings in 2018 alone. one effect: a big boost in stock prices.democrats also stood to gain from the tax bill, though not one voted for it


as part of the bill, republicans approved tax breaks in 2017 for seven classes of assets many of the wealthier members of congress held at the time, including partnerships, small corporations, real estate, and several esoteric investment vehicles. while they sold the bill as a package of business and middle-class tax cuts that would not help the wealthy, the cuts likely saved members of congress hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes collectively, while the corporate tax cut hiked the value of their holdings.


contrary to republican claims, the law is not paying for itself and is not likely to burden rich

as part of the bill, republicans approved tax breaks in 2017 for seven classes of assets many of the wealthier members of congress held at the time, including partnerships, small corpora nation with an additional $1.9 trillion in debt over 11 years beginning in 2018, according to the congressional budget office.

 at the time of its passage, most of the bill‚Äôs republican supporters said the cut would result in higher wages, factory expansions, and more jobs. instead, it was mainly exploited by corporations, which bought back stock and raised dividends. in 2018, stock buybacks exceeded $1 trillion for the first time ever, according to trimtabs, an investment researchpromises that the tax act would boost investment have not panned out. corporate investment is now at lower levels than before the act passed, according to the commerce department. though employment and wages have increased, it is hard to separate the effect of the tax act from general economic improvements since the 2008 recession.he boost in stock prices, however, was predictable.orrin hatch (r-ut) was chair of the senate finance committee in 2017, when he and his wife owned mutual funds and a limited liability corporation valued between $562,000 and $1.430 million, paying them between $12,700 and $38,500 in dividends and capital gains, according to hatch‚Äôs financial disclosure forms. they also owned a blind trust worth between $1 million and $5 million. (congressional financial disclosure forms do not require members to report the precise value of assets and income but rather in 11 different ranges, each with a minimum and a maximum value.)

senate finance committee chair orrin hatch in the senate president pro tempore office in washington, dc, on july 11, 2018. 
for decades, hatch, who retired in 2018, had been one of the loudest deficit hawks in congress. just 10 months before he would shepherd the tax bill through his committee, hatch said, ‚Äúthe national debt crisis poses a significant and growing threat to the economic and national security of this country.‚Äù

his concern over national security lasted two months. in april, hatch signaled he was open to a republican tax bill that would likely add to the national debt. when republicans passed the tax bill in december 2017, he beamed. ‚Äúthis is a historic night,‚Äù he said at a press conference.

(the center for public integrity sought comment from 13 current or former members of congress mentioned in this article; only two responded.)
republican lawmakers also boosted the value of their stock holdings when they encouraged american corporations to repatriate money they were holding overseas. the tax law decreed that future foreign profits would not be taxed at high rates, and that previously earned profits stashed abroad ‚Äî an estimated $2.7 trillion ‚Äî would be taxed one time at no more than 15.5 percent.

in 2017, apple was sitting on $250 billion in overseas profits. in january 2018, the month after trump signed the tax bill into law, the tech behemoth and third-largest american company said it would pay the new, lower tax and start bringing the cash home. just four months later, apple said it would buy back $100 billion of its stock and hike its dividend by 16 percent. apple shares increased almost 9 percent by the week‚Äôs end. in april 2019, apple announced $75 billion more in buybacks, a move analysts said would likely drive its stock price higher. a day after the announcement, shares increased in value nearly 5 percent. the stock continued to hit record highs late last year.

that increase and higher dividends augmented the holdings of 43 republicans who voted for the tax bill, including seven senators and their spouses who owned apple stock in 2018: john hoeven of north dakota; david perdue of georgia; arizona‚Äôs jeff flake, now retired; jim inhofe of oklahoma; and the spouses of pat roberts of kansas, maine‚Äôs susan collins, and shelley capito of west virginia. a spokesperson for hoeven said that he ‚Äúfollows senate regulations and reporting requirements.‚Äù sen. collins‚Äôs husband‚Äôs portfolio decisions are all made by a financial adviser, a collins spokesperson said, and he has not bought or sold apple stock since 2015.

perdue is one of the wealthiest senators, with a net worth of $15.8 million, $14 million of which is in stocks, according to roll call. in 2018, with his wife, perdue owned $100,000 to $250,000 in apple stock, he reported. the couple sold some of it and received annual dividends and capital gains that year between $15,000 and $50,000.

the optics that the tax cuts would boost the prices of stock he owned apparently didn‚Äôt concern perdue. weeks before republicans passed the tax bill, fox news host maria bartiromo asked perdue if he was worried that the corporate cuts would result in buybacks and increased dividends instead of new jobs. ‚Äúwell, maria,‚Äù he answered, ‚Äúi come from the school that, you know, all of the above is acceptable. this is capitalism.‚Äù he later added that it was all about ‚Äúcapital flow,‚Äù whether for jobs, economic growth, or dividends.

an affinity for ‚Äúsmall business‚Äù ‚Äî and pass-throughs
passing a law that helped fuel increases in stock prices wasn‚Äôt the only way republicans enriched themselves. the new law also contained a 20 percent deduction for income from so-called ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù businesses, a provision called the ‚Äúcrown jewel‚Äù of the act by the national federation of independent businesses, a lobbying group.

pass-throughs are single-owner businesses, partnerships, limited liability companies, (known as llcs) and special corporations called s-corps. most real estate companies are organized as llcs. trump owns hundreds of them, and the center for public integrity‚Äôs analysis found that 22 of the 47 members of the house and senate tax-writing committees in 2017 were invested in them.

pass-throughs can be found in any industry. they pay no corporate taxes and steer their profits as income to business owners or investors, who are taxed only once at their individual rates. despite their favored treatment as a business vehicle, the 2017 tax act did them another favor: it allowed 20 percent to be deducted off the top of the pass-through income for tax purposes.

in the senate, the champion for the pass-through break was ron johnson, a wisconsin republican who was a budget committee member when the tax bill was being written. he argued that because the bill was slated to give big corporations a 14 percent cut in their tax rate, smaller businesses should get a break, too. ‚Äúi just have in my heart a real affinity for these owner-operated pass-throughs,‚Äù he told the new york times when the senate was considering the tax bill in november 2017.

no doubt johnson, with his wife, held interests that year in four real estate or manufacturing llcs worth between $6.2 million and $30.5 million, from which they received income that year between $250,000 and $2.1 million, according to his financial disclosure form.

how much money lawmakers will pocket from the 20 percent pass-through deduction can‚Äôt be determined without an examination of their tax returns. there are limits on how much of the deduction can be taken based on total income and business category. but in some cases, the tax savings could run into the tens of thousands of dollars. johnson declined to comment for this article.

and while the provision did help small businesses in certain favored categories, the benefits of the pass-through deduction are heavily tilted toward the wealthy. sixty-one percent of the benefits of this provision will go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers in 2024, according to the joint committee on taxation, the congressional agency that analyzes tax bills.

gop real estate owners make out big
besides the law‚Äôs benefits to real estate p  ass-throughs, real estate in general was hugely favored by the tax law, allowing property exchanges to avoid taxation, the deduction of new capital expenses in just one year versus longer depreciation schedules, and an exemption from limits on interest deductions.

**‚Äúif you are a real estate developer, you never pay tax,‚Äù said ed kleinbard, a former head of congress‚Äôs joint committee on taxation.**",1,,1000000students,0

1661739288,"the best frugality tip is to know the difference between your needs and wants. for example, if i want anything online, then i'll add it to my cart but i'll sleep on it overnight. 99.99% of the time, i'll forget about it, so that item was not important to me at all. in the rare case, i'll think about it non-stop, and then it will become more productive to just buy it than to waste brain space to think about it. with this mindset, i rarely bought nonessential things and would wear out clothing items until there were holes and needed replacing - i'm a female and go to non-grocery stores maybe once a year. i guess you can say that i live a minimalist lifestyle (and this continues postgrad, when my current salary is 100k).

i also do not believe that more expensive things = better quality = long lasting. for example, the $35 costco winter coats are long lasting, warm, and more comfortable than the name branded winter coats. if there is a viable logo design on any of the items, then you are paying for the brandname/marketing rather than the item quality. secondarily, if you drop a high quality cup vs a low quality cup, then in both cases, you are still out a cup. i can also say the same for a lot of clothing items, especially when i find that repetitive wet lab work always seems to make holes in the same locations. 

because i had little money, i actually learned to manage my money much much better than before. credit card churning paid for trips and expensive things that i wanted and needed. i got into investing and would weigh any of my purchases against the price of a stock - do i want this new material item or do i want to buy another share of apple stock? because of compound interest and the growth of the market, i ended grad school with ~70k in stocks and ~10k in cash (emergency saving and checking account). grad students, especially single individuals, can definitely save and invest...if that is what you want. but only you can define what your needs and wants are.",15,,chillzxzx,0

1661797264,"nothing wrong with thinking big, and setting big goals for yourself at a young age. 

there's 3 ways usually, that people get 'rich.' maybe not f-u money rich but enough to retire early and work very little. 

most common is to work hard, and climb the ladder at a corporation and be c-suite where bonuses are in the millions. or, start your own business and make it super successful, so it either runs without you being involved day to day or you sell it. requires good people skillz and a lot of your efforts to reach this goal but is totally achievable. 

second way, also quite common but you won't know most of these people they don't make news, is to live very frugally and invest well. you have to decide if you have the personality for this, because it's sometimes hard to be a super social person and live like this (especially when you're younger). but if you start investing now, even like $50 a week, you will be much richer than any of your peers by college time. there's stuff written about trump, and how if he had invested his inheritance in index funds rather than gone into real estate, he'd have significantly more money now. he never made any money in real estate, if you subtract his losses from his gains over time. not everyone gets an inheritance, but it doesn't take much work to stash $50 a week in something. read some books about investing. also you're young so, speculating with your money is fine now,you might get lucky like people who bought apple stock at $15. 

i would say a little caution here about real estate is warranted... if trump couldn't make money even when starting with that much money, it's not like, a sure thing. lots of people try real estate investing and screw it up. read as much as you can but don't spend any money on a seminar or a guru, everything you need to know is available for free. here i'd say don't make speculative or risky investments like you might with stocks, because the stakes are so much bigger. be smart, be conservative. 

the third way is the least likely to succeed, but if you do, you will get f-u money. that's to have a best seller of some kind. a hit record, a movie role, a best selling book. something creative that gets big. i think most of these folks get rich almost by accident. they are doing something they really love, they'd be doing it even if they were just getting by.",6,,Chen__Bot,0

1661825235,"congratulations on starting your investing journey early! i wish i had started sooner! i am not an investing guru, but here is what i am doing with my capital/ money. hopefully, this gives you some insight on my strategy: 

  
1. 401k from the employer: i am investing bi-weekly in my 401k account- i chose 4 different funds to equally contribute (25% each): 1 s&amp;p 500 fund, 1 high growth tech fund, 1 small cap fund, and 1 international fund. i do rebalance this account once or twice a year, but other than that it's purely passive ""buy &amp; hold"" investing (time horizon 15-20 years). 

  
2. roth ira account: i have a roth ira account, where i mostly invest in high-quality dividend stocks. i don‚Äôt have to pay taxes on my dividends in a roth ira account, so that‚Äôs the primary motivation for choosing a roth ira for dividend investing. i have some high-quality growth stocks too, which don‚Äôt pay any dividends now, but hopefully, in 10-15 years, they will. also, i do some active trading on this account to boost my returns: buy low/sell high (tax-free capital gains, however, the risk is if you lose the money you can‚Äôt claim a capital loss, so be careful!). some of my holdings: $goog $intc $lrcx $amat $mmm $vz $meta $baba $vti $iwf $trow $sbux $blk $jpm $csco $rio $cmcsa $dpz $adbe $mdt $klac $sny $rhhby $gsk $nvs $ul $qcom $dow 

  
3. individual brokerage account: this is my individual account where i buy high-quality growth stocks to hold for long-term (5-10 years or more). i can claim losses on this account. at the end of the year, i look at my taxable income on this account and sell some of the losers to offset my taxable capital gains. some of my holdings are: $amzn $meta $nflx $pypl $bkng $dis $ea $googl and about 25% cash to deploy (hopefully soon)

  
4. individual brokerage account (for options): a separate individual brokerage account only for options trading. this is around \~5% of my entire portfolio.

these are the negatives that will create an opportunity to buy on declines.**($120 to $150)**  
1)the lack of ethereum mining pounds gpu's used for mining - that market is gone  
2) a crypto winter ensures used gpu cards being returned to the market, which will lead to sinking asp's.  
3) gaming inventory will take at least 2-3 quarters to clear.  
as a result, nvda's fy jan 2023 eps will be closer to $3.5, a huge drop over fy 2022.  
**why am i buying on declines?**

* the long term growth story is still intact; owning this stock for the next 3-5 years will pay off very well.
* data data growth will remain strong - data center overtook gaming for the 1st time in 2022 and should grow 53% yoy to $16.3bn for fy jan 2023, as gaming drops 38% to $7.8bn.
* as nvida clears out its bloated gaming inventory over the next 2 quarters, i except decent in gaming as well in fy 24 and fy 25, especially on what is now a lower base.
* nvidia's cuda software is a big competitive advantage and allows it to price its hardware much higher than competitors.
* the introduction of hopper, besides additional revenues from its mellanox acquisition will also contribute to revenues
* nvda also has an 11bn auto pipeline over the next 5 years  
my revenue estimates for the next 2 years are as under.  
all numbers are in $bn.

there is a layer of separation there.    
so if they loose a bunch of customers and the fees they charge customers cant pay their staffing costs then they go bust and will make arrangements for another provider to take over.    
if they decide, as managers of the fund making the day-to-day decisions, to sell everything that the fund owns and invest in a japanese fax machine factory then yeah your share in the fund is gonna be worth not much.   
however there are audits in place and performance leaderboards to discourage them from doing that.   
the idea is that they, as managers, make decisions to diversify the contents of the fund so your share of the fund stays profitable and reduce risk. eg. if its a growth fund which has some tolerance for a small amount of risk they might invest in apple stock as well as a forestry company.",0,,raytaylor,0

i grew up in hospitality industry so i was basically at working businesses 24x7 since i was in third grade.  that taught me a lot.  it's hard to get that type of experience through working for someone else, but it is possible.

i saw what was happening with computers in 1995, so i bought microsoft stock and a few others and some mutual funds.  i still hold the microsoft today.

when i bought my first car, it was a porsche boxster and i wrote a check for it.  the dumb part about that was if i didn't buy that car (and some others), i would have had enough of a return on my investments to buy a car like that new every year.  that was the biggest lesson i ever learned--10% of 100k is a lot, but 10% of 1m is a salary that you don't have to work for--save that 1m as fast as you can.  don't worry about living, just saving--you'll catch up and pass everyone on the living part later because 100k/yr isn't exactly easy to spend if you have no work. ;)

1661876663,"depends on what you're getting from that $1m. 

technically speaking, ""interest"" is primarily from something like a savings account.  you give a bank that $1m and they promise you can have it back whenever you want.  but in the meantime, they ""borrow"" that cash from you for their own business, usually making loans, earn some money back on that and give you a cut.  this is usually minimal, even ""high yield"" accounts are only offering 1.5-1.8% right now.  so that pile of cash would get you about $15k a year.  interest is treated by the irs as regular income, taxed the same as getting paid from a job.

more commonly, you're dealing with ""earnings"" from investments.  this has two methods of getting you more for your money.  

some companies pay dividends to share holders.  take apple: they're offering about 0.5% dividend (as a percentage of share price) for each share you own.  if you buy 6500 shares of apple stock at $154, then when the dividend is paid out you'll get about $5000 from them every so often.  usually quarterly, but i can't remember if the dividend percentage is per quarter or annually (so you'd receive $1250 every three months).  the ""catch"" is that the per-share price drops by that same 0.5% so your total value is pretty much the same $1m.  but now part is in spendable cash, and the hope is that the share price goes back up as the company does well.  ""qualified"" dividend payouts (i think the most common) are usually taxed like ""long term capital gains"", which is 15% for most people (though ltcg has it's own income-based brackets for very low or very high total income).  the same concept applies to things like mutual funds, which are just collections of a bunch of company stocks (or other financial assets).

or you hold onto the shares, the company does well, their stock price goes up, and your overall portfolio value rises with that increase.  but that doesn't get you liquid (spendable) money: you have to sell shares at that higher price to get dollars.  the profit you get from this sale is taxable, like regular income if held &lt;1 year, as ltcg.

in general, you get a nest egg built up and determine your ""safe withdrawal rate"": how much you can siphon out of your investments each year so that the balance lasts long enough (like until you die).  4% swr is the typical recommendation for retirement, a diversified portfolio with a reasonable risk allocation (so more than just apple) has a high chance of last 30-ish years.  if you've got a longer timeline (early retirement) then you may need a lower percentage.",79,,sciguyCO,0

1661883844,"&gt;fundamentally, i believe people do understand that public policies has a role in ensuring the overall healthy development of a free market, and much of which people can even adopt more willingly that otherwise lead to believe. property taxes in the us for example, is voted in at a local and state level, where most people do agree that there is a place for it to exist, to provide for local municipal services.

property taxes carve out massive loopholes that encourage uneconomic uses of property. california's prop 70 has caused the elderly and retired to refuse to leave their expensive real estate in the middle of the city, rather than move to the countryside as they have historically always done with old age and retirement. this is a significant contributor to rental crises in cities. corporate owners of real estate also are encouraged not to sell or redevelop the land since their property taxes would be readjusted from what they paid when they originally bought the property. 

almost ever state has some version of a homestead exception to their property taxes, though not as extreme as prop 70, allows elderly homeowners to freeze their property taxes. again, this is uneconomic because it encourages to elderly to sit on real estate in expensive places without paying equivalent property taxes.

&gt;not all market failures can be addressed by government, and some times the opportunity cost might just be too high, when the highest levels of most concentrated power uses very blunt tools to ""solve"" it.

land ownership in general is a market failure. it's an intrinsic monopoly, as no one has ever figured out how to create new land. thus it ends up being the most important thing for public policy to solve. because the venn diagram of people who own property and people who have political power is a circle in basically every city in the country, many cities choose policies that are at the expense of other citizens (renters) and do not encourage growth.

it's especially true because the average property owner is significantly leveraged, owing substantial portions of debt for their property. voting on property issues for many property owners is like voting on computer policies when your entire investment portfolio is significant amounts of apple stock on margin.",1,,xkjkls,0

1661896913,"i am going to tell you about three assets.

gic's: you give your money to the bank and they guarantee that you can have the principal and some interest as well

bonds: a business needs debt to fund expansion (or something) even if the business goes under you will get your money back (usually) but no gains.  pays better interest than a gic historically, but the money printer did some work and no one needs debt today so the returns are bad.

stocks: you buy a piece of the company. a piece of the risk, a piece of the rewards.  this is how ceo's are compensated (but instead of buying shares at $200 each they get them way cheaper) if the company is worth nothing the shares are worth nothing. but if the company does well and issues a dividend then you get a new paycheck.

what does any of this have to do with compounding interest?

the first two are pretty easy.

you have $100 today, next year you will have $104.  twenty years from now (with 4% gics forever) you will have over $200. not 4x20, but a full $100!

bonds work the same way. they pay better because they aren't guarenteeing anything. $100 might yield $107, twenty years of that and you have over $350. again better than 7x20.

equity is the most common.  but you know businesses like to grow, right? dominoes isn't going to get all excited about opening up there 1234th branch - they want to open 10% more each year.  or something. sell 1,000,000 teslas this year, great - but 1,000,001 doesn't make anyone happy next year.  they are growing at 10%, 20%, up to 50% a year.  so equities do the same. look at a chart of aapl stock and looks like a ramp. normalize it with logs and it makes more sense to our brains. growth is exponential.

so we expect 10% yoy growth on equities. like xeqt.

so $100 becomes $110, becomes $600 over twenty years.  even if you never bought another share of apple.  but you should reinvest dividends!",1,,Mysterious_Mouse_388,0

1661927253,"fundamental analysis on okse 

okse is the first non-custodial wallet directly with a visa card. it is made available to more than 170 countries with all transactions being on chain and also enable payment with crypto in more than 60 million merchants worldwide.

the okse wallet is a defi payments platform designed to revolutionize the financial market. it aims to replace all third parties in a financial transaction with smart contracts ‚Äî so that users can avoid unnecessary fees as well as credit/debit card fraud. 

okse card functions like a debit card backed by a very strong belief in a decentralized financial system. 

with the okse card you can spend and top up tokens like, bnb, busd, usdt, avax, usdc , ftm and several others. 

okse utility token called $okse can be use to apply as a discount option and as a valuable asset to increase your daily spending or top up limit for your okse card . apart from that, it can also be  use to participate in protocol governance and to vote on proposals , staking , payment and rewards of up to 5% of the monthly subscription .

having done a thorough research and due diligence about the okse project , i strongly believe that this project will appreciate better in the market .

the okse project is based on several networks (chain) and are backed by reputable investors such as the cypher capital, celer network and already gain limelight across the globe . 

 with some recent developments in the crypto industry and some major industries such as stocks, tech e.t.c, this project is coming in at the right time . 

recently, mercado libre which is the latin america‚Äôs largest e-commerce company launched its own cryptocurrency for its 80 million users in brazil . also, the recent one from samsung ,which is one of the high reputable company in the world launches into the metaverse with its own game and also google ($googl) has invested $1.56 billion into blockchain companies till this moment . the recent $430 billion inflation reduction act signed by the president of the united state can‚Äôt be understate because it will reduce the persistence increase in inflation rate and have a positive impact on the economy and purchasing power of the citizen .

the adoption of cryptocurrency has increase drastically of recent and this will help a lot of new project to appreciate provided they have a strong utility and backing . the okse project has what it takes to appreciate in both the short run and the long run .

although the underlying economic condition and situation around the globe must be taking into consideration such as the persistence increase in inflation , high interest rate , economic unrest of some nations, taxation rate and demand/supply which may just have a little effect on the performance of this project in the short run .

conclusively , with the spend-to-earn mechanism entails in the okse project and using of the okse card on different tokens to purchase goods, i strongly believe this project will appreciate in due time . most people will surely adopt the use of the okse wallet and card because it will be easier for them to open an account at your convenient time and purchase any goods you want more than the conventional bank account which has some kind of stress in it .

=sumif(indirect(""'38-2022'!$v:$v""),indirect(""'38-2022'!$u:$u""),$c890)

where everything in the indirect is a string which will be converted to formula. 

to use dynamic reference you will have to split up the string and add the week number as a dynamic reference, for example 

=sumif(indirect(""'""&amp;$a890&amp;""-2022'!$v:$v""),indirect(""'""&amp;$a890&amp;""-2022'!$u:$u""),$c890)

where cell a890 contains the number 38.. so u could just drag the formula down, and a891 contains 39, and so on...

1661959627,"i recall vaguely that there was a way to suppress a function from coming in the stack trace when doing assertions in rust. like i have a test utility function, which i call from multiple places in a test, and when the test fails the stack trace shows the line number in the utility function, not the place where it was called.


```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use serde_json::{value::number, value};

    fn a(v: value, out: &amp;'static str) {
        assert_eq!(super::to_json(&amp;v), out);
    }

    #[test]
    fn to_json() {
        a!(serde_json::json! {null}, ""null"");
        a!(serde_json::json! {1}, ""1"");
    }
}
```

if any test fails, i get stack trace showing line number inside `a()`.

i there any macro i can apply on the definition of `a()` so that it is ignored, and the call site is reported?

i can convert `a()` to a macro and achieve that:

```rust
    macro_rules! a {
        ($s:expr, $m: expr,) =&gt; {
            a!($s, $m)

1661962556,"it's a great question, actually. the the answer is messy. but it's a really, really important answer.

consider this question: ""how much money is in circulation?"" there are several very different answers to this question. there's the sum total of all the cash people have in their wallets. most people would argue that's too narrow a definition. what about chequing accounts? okay, so include those too. what about high interest savings accounts? people treat that like money. okay, maybe we should include those too. how about gics? is a 5 year gic different from a hisa? maybe. how about a 6 month gic? how about a government bond?

there's not really any right or wrong answer to the question: what counts as money. there's some things that are definitely money (cash), and there are some things that almost certainly aren't (collectible pogs). it's a sliding scale and there's no single right answer to where the line is. do we generally consider stocks to be money? no, most economists generally treat stocks as productive assets, but not money. 

so why don't we? well, consider this question: what is money used for? money is a medium of exchange. it isn't a productive asset. it's used to facilitate transactions. you use it to buy stuff. ultimately, the prices of things are determined both based on the relative scarcity of valuable goods and services, and *also* the relative scarcity of money. if you have lots of money but few goods, prices will be high. if you have lots of goods but little money, prices will be low.

so why does a stock price going up not count as printing money? because stock prices go up when a business demonstrates that it is becoming more profitable. typically a business becomes more profitable as it increases either the quantity or value of goods and services it provides. apple sells more iphones? apple stock goes up. investors feel richer, but conversely the supply of iphones has risen. so the balance isn't upset and the increase in stock price doesn't create inflation.",6,,PoliteCanadian,0

okse is the first non-custodial wallet directly with a visa card. it is made available to more than 170 countries with all transactions being on chain and also enable payment with crypto in more than 60 million merchants worldwide.

the okse wallet is a defi payments platform designed to revolutionize the financial market. it aims to replace all third parties in a financial transaction with smart contracts ‚Äî so that users can avoid unnecessary fees as well as credit/debit card fraud.

okse card functions like a debit card backed by a very strong belief in a decentralized financial system.

with the okse card you can spend and top up tokens like, bnb, busd, usdt, avax, usdc , ftm and several others.

okse utility token called $okse can be use to apply as a discount option and as a valuable asset to increase your daily spending or top up limit for your okse card . apart from that, it can also be use to participate in protocol governance and to vote on proposals , staking , payment and rewards of up to 5% of the monthly subscription .

having done a thorough research and due diligence about the okse project , i strongly believe that this project will appreciate better in the market .

the okse project is based on several networks (chain) and are backed by reputable investors such as the cypher capital, celer network and already gain limelight across the globe .

with some recent developments in the crypto industry and some major industries such as stocks, tech e.t.c, this project is coming in at the right time .

recently, mercado libre which is the latin america‚Äôs largest e-commerce company launched its own cryptocurrency for its 80 million users in brazil . also, the recent one from samsung ,which is one of the high reputable company in the world launches into the metaverse with its own game and also google ($googl) has invested $1.56 billion into blockchain companies till this moment . the recent $430 billion inflation reduction act signed by the president of the united state can‚Äôt be understate because it will reduce the persistence increase in inflation rate and have a positive impact on the economy and purchasing power of the citizen .

the adoption of cryptocurrency has increase drastically of recent and this will help a lot of new project to appreciate provided they have a strong utility and backing . the okse project has what it takes to appreciate in both the short run and the long run .

although the underlying economic condition and situation around the globe must be taking into consideration such as the persistence increase in inflation , high interest rate , economic unrest of some nations, taxation rate and demand/supply which may just have a little effect on the performance of this project in the short run .

conclusively , with the spend-to-earn mechanism entails in the okse project and using of the okse card on different tokens to purchase goods, i strongly believe this project will appreciate in due time . most people will surely adopt the use of the okse wallet and card because it will be easier for them to open an account at your convenient time and purchase any goods you want more than the conventional bank account which has some kind of stress in it .

1661973644,"most stock exchanges have a system where you can bet against a company.  basically this works by borrowing and selling the stock.  for example if microsoft stock is $250, and bob shorts 100 shares of microsoft, basically bob scrawls on a sheet of paper ""iou 100 shares of microsoft"" and sells that piece of paper for $25,000 through the same system used to trade actual shares.

""short covering"" is making good on your iou.  if microsoft stock goes down to $200, by short covering, bob can buy 100 shares for $20,000 and send them to make good on his iou.  bob makes a profit of $5000.

if microsoft stock goes up to $300, by short covering, bob now needs to buy 100 shares for $30,000 to make good on his iou.  in this case, he makes a $5000 loss.

basically, bob is betting against microsoft -- bob wins $100 for every $1 microsoft's stock price goes down, and bob loses $100 for every $1 microsoft's stock price goes up.

why doesn't bob take the $25,000 and run?  well, the system's designed to keep from being infected by bad iou's.  meaning the government and stockbrokers have a bunch of rules for customers like bob, for example ""you have to have enough money or other stocks in your account to be sure you can cover your iou's, plus a safety margin,"" plus ""you're not allowed to withdraw money or stocks from your account if it would put you in danger of not being able to make good on your iou's,"" plus ""if a stockbroker's customer sells a faulty iou and the stockbroker forgets to enforce the rules on them and they withdraw all their stocks and money and disappear, the stockbroker is on the hook to make good on the faulty iou, though they can try to sue the customer  -- if they can find them and if the customer isn't broke after spending all the money on booze and hookers.""

if microsoft stock goes up, why wouldn't bob just let his iou stick around forever?  well first of all, bob's stockbroker charges bob a fee for every day he owes on an active iou.  second of all, bob's stockbroker can make a ""margin call"", basically there's a rule that says ""if bob's losses mount and his iou obligations are looking like they might soon get bigger than the money and stocks in bob's account, his stockbroker can seize the money and stocks in bob's account and use them to make good on his iou's.""  usually this doesn't happen immediately, the stockbroker will typically first send bob some urgent, strongly worded emails and phone calls telling him he *must immediately* either make good on some of his iou's, or deposit additional money or stocks in his account.",3,,white_nerdy,0

nvidia doesnt even manufacture the product, nearly all final board manufacturer are chinese.

1661988160,"&gt;let's rebuild the entire housing market on the basis of past performance s&amp;p500 index returns

for that past 132 years, the stock market has outperformed housing.

source: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052015/which-has-performed-better-historically-stock-market-or-real-estate.asp

a huge part of the roi of housing comes from capital gains. if you take that away, there is no way housing will come anywhere near stocks in the long-term.

&gt;surely it's never possible those returns could look like those of europe, emerging markets, china, or japan

if this comes to pass, then it's a problem for governments to solve. housing is a non-productive, dead asset (like gold), that drags the economy as an investment, thanks to over-leveraging and period bubble/bust cycles.

&gt;also what use does it have if more money flows into stocks? if you buy apple stock today it's not like apple has more money to do something productive

this demonstrates a misunderstanding of the value of the secondary market in stocks. it's a long explanation, so i won't go into details, but here are the main benefits to a company from having its shares traded on the stock exchange:

1. share trading lets a company know how much money they can realistically raise in the capital market, which is crucial for any decision on financing. a good stock price gives you improved credit scores and superior financing.

2. price discovery and signals that let a company know if it's moving in the right direction.

3. liquidity for investors, means that anyone purchasing a stock is also selling it to someone else for either re-investment into the economy, or for spending. both of which are good for the economy.

putting money into the stock market is a direct investment into productive businesses.",0,,BJPark,0
