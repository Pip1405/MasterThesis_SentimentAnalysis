1662025431,"#### okse fundamental analysis ####

okse is the first non-custodial wallet directly with a visa card. it is made available to more than 170 countries with all transactions being on chain and also enable payment with crypto in more than 60 million merchants worldwide.

the okse wallet is a defi payments platform designed to revolutionize the financial market. it aims to replace all third parties in a financial transaction with smart contracts ‚Äî so that users can avoid unnecessary fees as well as credit/debit card fraud.

okse card functions like a debit card backed by a very strong belief in a decentralized financial system.

with the okse card you can spend and top up tokens like, bnb, busd, usdt, avax, usdc , ftm and several others.

okse utility token called $okse can be use to apply as a discount option and as a valuable asset to increase your daily spending or top up limit for your okse card . apart from that, it can also be use to participate in protocol governance and to vote on proposals , staking , payment and rewards of up to 5% of the monthly subscription .

having done a thorough research and due diligence about the okse project , i strongly believe that this project will appreciate better in the market .

the okse project is based on several networks (chain) and are backed by reputable investors such as the cypher capital, celer network and already gain limelight across the globe .

with some recent developments in the crypto industry and some major industries such as stocks, tech e.t.c, this project is coming in at the right time .

recently, mercado libre which is the latin america‚Äôs largest e-commerce company launched its own cryptocurrency for its 80 million users in brazil . also, the recent one from samsung ,which is one of the high reputable company in the world launches into the metaverse with its own game and also google ($googl) has invested $1.56 billion into blockchain companies till this moment . the recent $430 billion inflation reduction act signed by the president of the united state can‚Äôt be understate because it will reduce the persistence increase in inflation rate and have a positive impact on the economy and purchasing power of the citizen .

the adoption of cryptocurrency has increase drastically of recent and this will help a lot of new project to appreciate provided they have a strong utility and backing . the okse project has what it takes to appreciate in both the short run and the long run .

although the underlying economic condition and situation around the globe must be taking into consideration such as the persistence increase in inflation , high interest rate , economic unrest of some nations, taxation rate and demand/supply which may just have a little effect on the performance of this project in the short run .

conclusively , with the spend-to-earn mechanism entails in the okse project and using of the okse card on different tokens to purchase goods, i strongly believe this project will appreciate in due time . most people will surely adopt the use of the okse wallet and card because it will be easier for them to open an account at your convenient time and purchase any goods you want more than the conventional bank account which has some kind of stress in it .

1662032827,"while that is a good mindset for regular people,  with politicians like pelosi, there are only so many coincidences before it is obvious that she is insider training.  

reminder that the same coincidence happened just a few months ago with microsoft after she bought a lot of microsoft stock right before a government contract was assigned.

there is visa that she just let go of and guess what,  congress is planning on going after the dominance of visa and master card soon.

these are happening to much and there is no way for us to ever prove definitively that is happening. the only way to stop it would be to ban congress from trading stocks. they have an obvious way to abuse the power with no real oversight. the stupid ones have been caught doing it and even they walk away fine from it (think perdue). 

the whole idea of ""well give me evidence"" when we are talking about a government official, not an individual without power,  doesn't work when the people have the ability to hide the evidence. 

best recent example of this i can think of is the torture discovery. there has been rumors that the us was brutally torturing members of terrorist groups and at times civilians.  these continuosly could not be proved until finally someone came out and showed the pictures. for years we had been doing these things and nobody knew because nobody could provide the evidence.  

or we can look at the iran missile crisis. it was entirely fabricated at the time and thousands of civillians died because of bush's and cheney's lie. 

we must have a higher level of scrutiny for those in power and if there is part of a system that can be taken advantage,  we should block it off from those in power.",5,,pylio,0

i agree with you though, there are plenty of politicians doing this, she's just one of them, and a slew of them either made a ton or avoided losing a ton surrounding the pandemic, which i always found incredibly suspect. but until laws are changed, what can anyone do other than point out that this happens? that's the problem - we essentially invite the power-hungry and wealth-hungry to become politicians and then wonder why they don't really serve us well or rush to pass laws to limit their ability to make dirty money.",2,,SunriseSurprise,0

1662058289,"some additional info since this is what got me digging.

i saw this segment this morning live on cnbc¬† and decided to look around for other sources on chris schwarz and his paper. becky segways from bath so i didn't want to post it.

https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/01/new-study-shows-no-fee-trading-may-be-costing-investors-34-billion.html

i had a listen to the recorded version and they trimmed it. i decided to post the link as a source  for some additional information. for those who do not want to click the link i did a rough transcript.

intro after bath segway

becky: trading has been done by retail investors on platforms that often offer zero commission trading. however, there's a new study out that shows no fee trading isn't what it seems, and it may be costing investors billions
of dollars a year. 

joining us now is one of the authors of that study, christopher schwarz. he is a finance professor at university of ca. irvine. 

chris, let's talk about this study because when i saw it, it really grabbed my attention. 

*you went about doing this with some other professors, you put your own money
at work executing trades, did the trades simultaneously over 5 different platforms, and found some very wide differences in terms of what you ended up getting with those charges. i guess its proof that there is no free
lunch.

chris: cough, cough. we basically, what happened was we were doing another
study and we opened a brokerage account, and we decided to do one other brokerage account in parallel, so nothing related to this, and after the first day the one account lost $150, and the other brokerage account
actually made $12.

what we found that lead us to this rabbit-hole that you talked about was we ended placing an 85k trades for $17m dollars over 5 1/2 months on 6 different brokerage accounts. 

basically we found that the very best broker, you lost about 7 basis points on a round-trip trade. so on a $1k trade, you lose about .70c. 

on the very worst broker, you actually lose about 46 basis points, $4.60.

the spread between the best and the worst broker was almost 6 ¬Ω times the cost.

becky: which is shocking! i mean, there had to be reasons behind that. what did you find?

*chris: what the sec would probably tell you is pfof, but what we actually found was that there was no relation between the variation of payment for order flow and the variation or execution.

just to give you a concrete example our #1 broker has pfof, but our #3 &amp; #5,
in terms of execution and price actually don't have pfof. so that didn'texplain it.

ultimately, what we found was, essentially the market centers, though as you know when you place a retail trade now it doesn't go to an exchange it goes to citadel, virtu, or some other market center. 

basically the market centers were giving different pricing to different brokers. so you would have 2 trades go to the same market center at the same time and get radically different pricing on a consistent basis. 

becky: chris what did citadel and virtu have to say when you reached out to them? 

chris:¬† so, you know, basically all of them said that each broker has a different value for their order flow. so, just to give you an idea, if i'm a brokerage and i have one person buy apple stock and one sell apple stock, that's great for the market maker because they can just cross the 2 trades and make a profit.

but if all of us go out and buy bath at the same time, then obviously that is incredibly expensive order flow for the market centers, like i'm guessing right now citadel, virtu and others wish they didn't have to actually fill orders for that stock. 

so the explanation we got was, basically the value, or the profitability for order flow from different brokers is different. 

becky: when i read this study i was kind of amazed because when you read free trades you think it's free trades but obviously there are costs behind the scenes.",12,,awwshitGents,0

hard to defend that statement when every major corporate news outlet you listen to and every corporation is working overtime to boost the regime and unelected establishment. your argument sounds like mainstream 2016 clinton campaign rhetoric.

just yesterday it was announced that pelosi made 600k on nvidia stock trades linked to her chip legislation. the dems are firmly the party of wall street. this has been the case for nearly a decade. some r's too but dems are in bed with wall street. very tight.


&gt; the truly baffling part is that the vast majority of the state will defend millionaires and billionaires that they feel somehow represent them.

they want to be left alone. they'll straight up tell you if you listen to them. kinda hard to be left alone when potus was trying to pass vax mandates, pass new regulations, etc. so yeah, if the rich kid will shield them from that so they can experience the liberty and freedom they value above cash then that's the price. 

blue collar workers used to make up the base of the dems. you hinted at this yourself when you say that it's the less educated hard workers and manual laborers who supported trump as opposed to the out of touch ivory tower intellectuals. the republican gov in va and his black female partner only won because of black men and hispanic voters who tipped the scales. they also turned out in record numbers for trump, both times.

trump was the one appealing to them with his campaign speech; ""rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation"" while hillary courted liberal college feminists, celebrity and gave private talks to wall street investors about her [""public vs private positions""](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/8/hillary-clinton-says-she-has-both-public-and-priva/) that benefited them (and lined her pockets).

that was me, and i was quoting a fund validator and admin for unification‚Äôs official discord who stated that xfund was simply a utility token that is used to pay for unification‚Äôs services, such as oracle as oracles (ooo) which powers shibaswap to track prices and as automated market maker (amm), or verified open randomness (vor) which was used for shiboshis and soon for the blockchain version of shib‚Äôs collectible card game.

it took me a while to _finally_ verify that xfund is indeed an oracle after asking unification devs themselves and they pointed me to a description on their site that mentions the oracle portion of xfund being limited to **querying ‚Äúfund mainnet for the current active validator set, along with their current fund stakes.‚Äù** ‚Äî full text of the blurb so you understand exactly what the oracle version of xfund does:

_‚Äúeach day, the xfund oracle queries fund mainnet for the current active validator set, along with their current fund stakes.

each validator‚Äôs stake is then calculated as a percentage of the total network stake, which is used by the emission algorithm to calculate the probability an xfund will be allocated to the validator. the emission algorithm runs 24 times, each time emitting 1 xfund and allocating it to a validator based on the probability.‚Äù_

xfund powers shibaswap in that it is used to _**pay**_ for unification‚Äôs service that makes it work, oracles of oracles (ooo).

## after learning this info, i updated my post and mentioned that in fact xfund is an oracle. no shame since the goal of the post was to educate the community and dispel fud.

shytoshi refers to the unification dev team and the $xfund token interchangeably as ‚Äúxfund‚Äù which is why he said they are a ‚Äúbig part of it‚Äù ‚Äî he gave a hint of this by stating in the tweet that known_form loves to share by describing  $xfund as their ‚Äúoracle provider‚Äù which is exactly what the unification foundation is, the ones _providing_ the oracles and services used to make shib products work.

someone else in this chat linked an article as ‚Äúproof‚Äù that xfund is more involved than already stated by the shib team previously, but completely dismissed that the article itself also says that an official shib team member, trophias, says xfund is its own thing and that ‚Äúwe only use their services‚Äù ‚Äî which is exactly what it is, **think of the unification devs building the os that shibarium will run on.** trophias is now an official member of the metaverse team along with helping out with defense and community building.

going back to comparing the services that the unification devs have built as the os shibarium (and other shib projects) will run on, we can see their value which no one here is denying.

## what we‚Äôd like to clear up is the confusion and fud that xfund has a bigger role than the services they‚Äôre providing or that other community-made projects, such as shibaverse, are an official shib product which it‚Äôs not.

think of xfund as apple, and shibarium as a popular ios game. imagine apple enthusiasts brigading a forum specifically made to discuss said game, telling people they should buy apple stock because it‚Äôs going to make them rich. also imagine those same apple enthusiasts saying that the game‚Äôs success will be owed to the fact that it‚Äôs running on ios, nevermind its community, gameplay, and upcoming release updates the dev team has in-store.

**in the illustration above, ios devs are completely separate for the game devs even though apple is providing a quality product, the operating system the game is running on.**

i share your xfund enthusiasm but, please, instead of dismissing people or going as far as asking them to ‚Äúsuck [your] bawss‚Äù as known_form did, the best way to motivate someone to buy xfund is through education.

when i was confident that xfund wasn‚Äôt an oracle because i was told it wasn‚Äôt directly from one of their validators, i got a link from one of the commenters to my post about a twitter spaces ama where they mention xfund‚Äôs role in the shib ecosystem, including other services that unification has built. it was a non-biased talk breaking down what every service did and how exactly they interact with shibaswap and other shib products.

to give credit to xfund for the success of shib products is akin to saying the top selling apps  on the appstore would be nothing without ios. what made them top selling was the product itself, the app, not the ios. if the ios was that influential in the success of an app, then _all_ ios apps would be top selling.

for my dad, partly perhaps it was a lesson on having an emergency fund. but even in his case, alternative in that moment was what? homelessness? he needed the money. no need to beat yourself up for it after the fact.

i sometimes fantasize about what my life today would be like if back then i got a part time job in high school and bought apple stock with every pay check. i definitely felt that i knew the potential of that company back then. but that‚Äôs all it is, a fantasy. the best i can do now is put my extra money in to the market.",37,,Uknow_nothing,0

my stock positions are divided as such:

\- 65%: etf: vwrl

\- 35% aapl stock (350 shares)

in the last 2 years, the aapl stock outperformed the all world etf by a lot (currently up +5% on etf, and +35% on aapl).

i'm a big apple user and i see the company going up and up and that is the main reason i doubled down on aapl, even if the top company of the etf is indeed apple.

apple is on a down trend currently and as i would not mind buying its stock, i don't see why i shouldnt leverage myself and go with leaps as far in time as possible.  
the way i see it, worse case is that i get called and i need to buy the stock, but as my current plan is to hold my positions for at least 5-8 years from now, i don't see this as a big downside.

what have we seen in comparison from sony ? a smoke and mirrors talk from cerny focusing on mostly the magic ssd which as we have seen is not magic, rebranded amd tech like tempest audio and older tech like primitive shaders which first appeared on vega

&amp;#x200b;

ps5 has nothing like sfs and if you believe being able to scrub the gpu cache is the same as offering fine grain access to assets and textures on the fly, then you are clearly delusional. the cache scrubbers just saves wait times on system ram and the ps5 doesnt even feature any arm cores like the pro design had.

by designing a fast io system combined with compression, the ps5 needs to do a lot of decompression too. this is possibly why the actual performance of the magic ssd has been so lacklustre and of course controller thermals

spiderman is built on proprietary engine designed for freebsd os and sonys proprietary apis, so the performance hit could come from implementing windows and dx12. how can they offload onto magic co-processors when the ps5 design doesnt have them?

&amp;#x200b;

really amd calls its a rdna family now and rdna 2 is a refresh of navi with added dx12u compliant features, sony themselves was only classing it as rdna originally just like navi....

[https://imgur.com/lynowii](https://imgur.com/lynowii)

those  ue5 engine techs will work even better with full hardware support and acceleration though

the console contracts gave amd the x86 gaming market so really i dont see your point. ive stated a few times now nvidia dominates the aib market but with the ever decline of the consumer market its doing them no favours with their tech all but trapped in their, especially compared to how many markets amd now covers

last year mining was still viable and why cards from both parties was selling like hotcakes, sadly that bubble has now burst. both amd and more so nvidia stock has been taking a hammering since the us banned chip exports to china. amd have their fingers in many pies and this is paying dividends in both market share and revenue

no my comment about drivers was not a joke i have been building pcs since the 90s and currently amds driver stack is very stable and has more features than nvidias

the problem with the proper g-sync monitors has always been the price which is why nvidia started to properly support vesa adaptive sync and started rebranding freesync panels.

freesync again has the market as it has support on consoles (well apart from the ps5 and ms even offered it the previous gen), support on tvs from the likes of lg or samsung, has support over hdmi. while nvidia can use freesync branded panels it cant use the proprietary tech amd added to the vesa adaptive sync spec like lfc, hdr, hdmi support. 

hdmi 2.1 vrr does not offer lfc, 120hz+hdr etc. why sony has not adopted freesync seeing as they are a amd partner is beyond me. 

amds fsr will also become the main choice because its open source and cross platform, the ps5 has already implemented v1 in a game and ms is supporting fsr 2.0 on xss/s. again dlss being proprietary and locked in the aib market does it no favours, the only tech outside of aib that might use it is a new nintendo switch but that is in a niche anyway

the s is what the gaming market needed a cheap next gen one s replacement and like ive already stated once we see sfs in games even the smaller memory pool wont be a issue. gaming should always be accessible and affordable, with ms ramping up xcloud now people wont even need a console to access gp content

if by co-processor you mean a customised compute unit to handle decompression, xsx/s has this too which is why the gpus are larger by 4cus than what is available for graphics

hardware decompression ‚Äì hardware decompression is a dedicated hardware component introduced with xbox series x and xbox series s to allow games to consume as little space as possible on the ssd while eliminating all cpu overhead typically associated with run-time decompression. it reduces the software overhead of decompression when operating at full ssd performance from more than three cpu cores to zero ‚Äì thereby freeing considerable cpu power for the game to spend on areas like better gameplay and improved framerates. hardware decompression is one of the components of the xbox velocity architecture.

1662486915,"**main question**: how do i incorporate ito's lemma into the solution of a continuous-time stochastic cake-eating problem if i'm writing down the hamilton-jacobi-bellman equation?

**elaboration**: i'm interested in finite-horizon, continuous-time cake-eating problems in which the agent has a time-horizon $w$ over which to eat the cake, and then chooses an optimal consumption path $\{h\_t\}_0^w$, subject to stochastic utility shocks.

in particular, my setting has a brownian process $a\_t ~ g(a)$ with $e[a] = 1$, and the instantaneous utility from eating $h\_t$ cake is $a\_t v(h\_t)$.

the agent discounts the future at a rate $\rho$, so the formulation of the optimization problem is:

$$
\max\_{h_t_0^w}  e [ \int\_0^w e^{-\rho t} \times a\_t v(h\_t(s\_t,a\_t)) dt ]
$$

where $h\_t(s\_t,a\_t)$ is cake consumption as a function of the amount of cake left $s\_t$ and the utility shock $a\_t$.

i'm familiar with discrete-time optimization using bellman equations, and have been reading about solutions to continuous-time optimization via the hamilton-jacobi-bellman equation. however, i haven't found a single full solution method for the case with a finite horizon *and* stochastic utility.

so far, my approach has been to write down the hjb equation which looks like:

$$
\rho \mathcal{v}(s,a,t) = \max_h a v(h) + \mathbb{e} \, \mathcal{v}^\prime(s,a,t) \dot{s}(h)
$$

where $s$ is the amount of cake left and the following transition equations and boundary conditions hold:

$$
\dot{s\_t} = -h\_t(s,a\_t)   s\_w = 0   s\_0 = t
$$

but i don't know if this equation &amp; set of conditions fully characterizes the solution. in particular, based on my reading of ito's lemma, i'm not sure if i need to add a second condition on the solution path which takes ito into account.

since i'm working with a general form of utility $v$, i don't need to find a closed-form solution (i'll eventually take a discrete approximation and solve the associated bellman equation via value function iteration), but i'd like to make sure that i'm writing down the 'correct' solution form to the continuous-time equation. 

i asked the problem on math.stackexchange [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4521703/is-this-an-accurate-solution-to-a-finite-horizon-continuous-time-stochastic-cake) but got no replies (but the formatting might be nicer there!)",1,,fogele,0

`foreach ($v in‚Ä¶`

1662488213,"&gt; the customers cover the cost of the products and services. 

ok i will try again. think of a rental property as landlords providing housing-as-a-service. just like you pay when you rent a car, you are making a payment to a landlord in exchange for the service of living in a maintenance free low obligation low risk space.

the same thing applies when a homeowner gets a mortgage. the bank is providing a service by giving a loan and homeowners have to make payments on the service (loan). but in a mortgage, the financial instrument is slightly different and uses 30 year amortization. 

&gt; a company is not the same as an investor. investments are stocks, bonds, property, etc. you buy your own stocks and bonds, and you don't expect someone else to pay for those investments until you decide to sell. 

wrong. as an investor in apple, i own a share of apple, the company. i expect customers of apple (similar to renters) to pay for the service apple is providing them to generate a return of capital on my money that i invested. this is business 101.


&gt; with real estate you put in a down payment and expect someone else to pay the rest, and when you sell you stand a really good chance of not only selling for enough to get back your down payment but also walking away with a profit. 

it‚Äôs the same when i put in $100k towards apple stock (akin to a downpayment), and i except customers of apple to buy apples overpriced shit which work their way through the income statement of apple generate returns on my money so i can walk away with a profit.

&gt; meanwhile when you sell your tenant is probably going to be kicked out into a more competitive and more expensive rental market, and will have nothing to show for all the money they put into your investment.

funny enough, this absolutely ridiculous conversation actually gave me an idea to help you renters. i will look into as i kind of understand your argument now.

&gt; investing in real estate with the intention of bleeding someone else dry in order for them to pay for your investment is greedy af. 

i can argue that apple or any cell phone manufacturer is bleeding their customer dry to pay for their investment in manufacturing the phones.",3,,p3rmstar,0

how then apple stock performed so well? their user base is close to a cult which doesn't mind paying much more for little improvement each year. as a result apple successfully increased their sale revenue from a stagnating user base.

is it sustainable in a recession affecting 99% of the population? probably not as even higher earning us incomes have started pulling back on their spending habits. and the pull back will obviously be more pronounced in foreign markets more impacted by recession such as europe or china ( russia was also a popular market until last year )

1662573072,"&gt; okay, but in order to have skins you need to have games that are associated with those skins. and steam doesn't allow users to sell games to each other because that would be a terrible business model both for them and the companies who publish the games.

but steam literally made their flagship games *free* because the skins make them so much more than the title sales 

&gt; gamestop is never going to have any quality games, so they won't be able to make money off skins.

you can make a lot happen with $100+ million grants though. furthermore you don‚Äôt need in house games, what this would be is the infrastructure for publishers to be able to plug and play digital assets into a liquid marketplace without having to hire an entire team to create and maintain a market that is separated from every other ecosystem (imagine having to use a special broker to buy aapl stock, and to swap for msft, having to sell there, wait for settlement, transfer funds to a bank, wait for settlement, transfer to another special brokerage to buy msft) gamestop is collecting a royalty off of the transactions themselves, they don‚Äôt need to own the parent publisher to profit off of market activity. i‚Äôm not sure i would say gaming titles will be traded as there isn‚Äôt precedent for that, but skins? there‚Äôs incredible amounts of money to be made there, *disgusting* amounts of money, look into the video game skins world and you‚Äôll be absolutely shocked at how large it is 

&gt; also notice how useless the nft technology is with this use case. you could just as easily allow users to sell games and/or skins back and fourth to each other without utilizing the blockchain at all. that is why nfts are a dumb gimmick with no real purpose. a solution in search of a problem.

you‚Äôre just too committed to the nft = bad mindset here, yes you can easily enable cross ecosystem value exchange‚Ä¶by sharing the same ledger. which is what nft essentially does. people who don‚Äôt understand how blockchain works imagine it like this over complicated endeavor when in reality it is literally the easiest and most simple way for separate entities to trust assets that are not solely bound to an internal ledger. they can allow assets to trade outside of their game and be ported back in seamlessly without having to concern themselves with whether the assets coming back are legit or not.  whether through gamestop or not this is going to be utilized all over gaming ecosystems. instead of creating a skin and making a few grand on sales, you essentially turn it into a crypto currency, involve a massive market of speculators and traders, and reap benefits from it for years to come. skin collections as nfts will be seen as a higher value by end users, will outperform the sales of any other skin collection that does not allow resale, and the publisher gets to continue reaping benefits from them for years and years in the future. 

one thing i‚Äôd agree with you on is that you need a fun game for players to value the skins. but honestly that‚Äôs inevitable in my eyes, these companies want profit, and there‚Äôs so much money to be made by doing this. if a high value game like fortnite released an nft skin they‚Äôd probably make $5m+ within mere *minutes* of release, and then would reap fees from speculators and users trading it back and forth for years to come",0,,moneyhustardsauce,0

&amp;#x200b;

also, they just added their first nft game, partnering with ftx, two other blockchain partners, and im sure there is more to be announced as more and more time goes on, just look at whos backing them, basically everyone except the media and wsb, and theres theories many of u are bots or paid shills, not saying you are, but they exist, in large numbers...

theres so many big names rocking with gme one way or another, and gme clearly stated they are focused on evolving into a tech/ecommerce company and are still undergoing massive changes in the company, other than that, no forward guidance... 

do u remember when amazon sold only books? yeah, me too, my mom made 400% on it selling at like $12 a share.. lmayooooo ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)

any way, we learned our lesson on apple, amazon, rim, and mad other stocks, sometimes 400% is nice, but when your investing in a company going from bankruptcy to tech/ecommerce, that, my friend, can take years... which is awesome, longer means more shares for me.. yayyyy.

1662595696,"you‚Äôre right, and your wrong at the same time. 

yeah, the marketplace isn‚Äôt doing much right now. it‚Äôs mostly just fasclitating shitty jpg sales, which has to be one of the all time most redarded use cases. 

but i don‚Äôt really give a fuck what it‚Äôs doing right now, i care about what it‚Äôs going to do in 10 years. 

imagine not buying apple stock in 2007 because ‚Äúthe iphone is a flop, they only sold 1.7m iphones!‚Äù

or not buying tesla because ‚Äútesla is a flop! they only sold 10 cars!!!‚Äù 

i‚Äôd anticipate volume continues to be shit for the nft marketplace as long as they keep using it for shitty uses cases like redarded monkey jpgs.

but ask yourself honestly: is there a use case for it in regards to things like limited release games, gaming collectibles, skins, and the other things that people pay big money for? like yah yah, gamers hate nfts and blahblahblah. but gamers also hate the monetization that comes with skins, loot boxes, and locked content, and it still happens in games because the companies making games want to make money. as an investor, i don‚Äôt really give a fuck about the broke gamer who buys a game for $30 on sale and complains that they don‚Äôt get access to all the content. look at the most recent diablo game - hated by reddit gamers for micro transactions, and literally just fucking shoveling money at activision/blizzard from the smaller subset of people with actual money who are willing to pay. i care about winning those people over, and nfts are fucking great for those people, because now they can buy *and* sell them for profit, giving gamestop and the company residuals each time they change hands. everybody wins but the poors, and who gives a fuck about them? i‚Äôm here to make money, not run a charity organization for poor gamers who can‚Äôt afford all the content. 

and there‚Äôs an even stronger usecase in the realm of music streaming, sales, and digital ownership. if i stop paying for my apple music account, all the music i‚Äôve downloaded goes kaput. and if i download something and don‚Äôt like it, i can‚Äôt sell it and get some money back. i‚Äôd love to go to a digital ownership model and say fuck streaming. 

and with the amount of money that spotify/apple music / pick your poison pulls away from the artists, i can guarantee there are a lot of artists who feel the same way. 

more challenges exist in the world of movies and shows, as production tends to cost a fair amount and it‚Äôs less common for people to spend time producing in their bedroom, but look at what just happened over at wb/hbo where the fucked a bunch of smaller shows by permanently shelving them without ever seeing the light of day so they could take a tax write off, fucking all the artists who poured time and effort into them and preventing them from ever making any money on residuals. i‚Äôd have to think there are quite a fight artists that are pissed off about that.

and i‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to be the next apple, or spotify, or that it‚Äôs going to take netflix out of business tomorrow. 

but there is room for them to make pretty massive inroads into those services, and there‚Äôs a viable product with which to do so already developed and on the table. all they need to do now is start marketing it to move forward. 

you‚Äôre worried about their runway right now? they have 909m and no debt. at their current burn rate they have about 2 years without borrowing a dime. they just laid off about 20% of the company which will show up on next quarters report, and their e-commerce is moving along quite nicely. if the runway starts looking shorter, it‚Äôd be pretty straightforward to start closing the brick and mortars and save costs there. 

the reality is, they‚Äôre not going out of business due to lack of funds anytime soon, and there‚Äôs absolutely no reason that they‚Äôll need to do another share offering with any sort of immediacy whatsoever. they have a stellar product right now that nobody else can really compete with, enormous amounts of public goodwill, and a bunch of major companies getting antsy about diving in on a new gold rush.

maybe your right. maybe nfts flop, the marketplace never gets beyond where it‚Äôs at right now, and the longs investment doesn‚Äôt pay out. but me? i look at the negative sentiment towards nfts as a starting point, not an ending point.

1662691889,"the democrats pretend to care. the republicans dont. so we vote democrat. everyone works for corporations. they just wanna get rich. nancy pelosis husband buys and sells stocks based on when legislation passes.  


this is just a period in history were politicians are corrupt as hell. and one group is not as bad as the other one.  


but if you think anyone cares about you its because you dont understand how campaign financing works.   


if the democrats cared about us everyone else besides biden would have dropped out of the race and let bernie win in 2020 and hilary would have let bernie win in 2016  


but then the rich would whine and take funding away. and corporations would have to pay fair taxes. and everyone in dc would get sent home because they failed to keep the rich satisfied.  


thats why they cancel student loan debt for young people... who have college educations... because that is a voting block they want  


if they wanted to stimulate the economy and help everyone they would give everyone money to pay off whatever debt they have... not just the people who they want to show up to vote, who are statistically more likely to earn higher incomes in the long run because they have secondary educations!  


once you own a couple thousand dollars worth of stocks you start to realize the government is made up of people who own a few million in stocks, who do favors for the people who own billions in stocks... so those millions grow into more millions and the billions grow into more billions  


and the peasants take out student loans to pay for tuition at the highest prices ever to learn chemistry and biology and engineering to work for the lowest inflation adjusted wages for the corporations owned by people whose names we do not know because they invest through family vehicles created years ago by the last generation of billionaires  


its pretty badass how brainwashed they got everyone into thinking the other half of regular stupid brainwashed americans are the problem  


if they gave a shit they would all be as mad as bernie sanders is every time he opens his mouth. but they dont. they're pretending.  


and bernie has to pretend to so everyone doesnt just give up like the people who live in the projects and stops voting  


this is how a nation that borrowed too much money for wars collapses. with a political class of whores that dismantles the government because the stupid elite class of wealthy inheritors literally thinks taxes are pointless.  


then the barbarians come and ask for the gold at fort knox  


and the government says we lied we aint got shit   


and everyone sees the emperor is naked   


and then we get feudalism again  


but slow enough for every generation to not notice it.  


our great great great grandfathers knew that gold was money. the most valuable coins were gold and silver. our great grandfathers got to use paper money as well as gold. our grandfathers were forced to trade their gold in for paper.  


gold was money. now paper is money too. now gold is gone and paper is money. paper became debt once gold disappeared. so money is debt now. then credit cards.  


everyone works for the banks. thats all america is. a race to buy up all the stock. and a bunch of people who don't know about the race because the more regular fucks who know the less the rich can buy up.   


so they look for jobs and careers and work they are passionate about. as if feudalism is not staring us in the face like a freight train.

it is my view that series 3 ceases receiving new features starting with watchos 9 due to this deep incompatibility.  

i am not a worshipper at the church of planned obsolescence, so i give little weight to the possibility that apple will release a watchos update that includes s8 but excludes s7.

&gt; trade-in resale value 

i agree this is a valid concern, but in my view it reduces to ‚Äúthere is no bad apple watch, there is only a bad price.‚Äù    

ovulators as a group will always value s8 more than series 7, but in my view worried ovulators are much less likely to be bidding in the second-hand market, so i heavily discount their preferences in my secondary-market price model.  

&gt; ‚Ä¶ ‚Ç¨90 more ‚Ä¶  

buy the s7 and ‚Ç¨90 of apple stock. then, when you sell the s7, also sell the apple stock. if your profit on the stock does not cover the price difference between an s7 and s8, come back and call me names.

1.  crypto market is in the trash so the market is being flooded with used mining gpus, so why buy a new gpu when you can get a used one.
2. there is no real reason to upgrade cpu's or gpu's currently.  the aaa game market is absolute trash.  look at the steam charts.  cs:go, dota, apex, lost ark.  all of these games can run well on older hardware so no reason to go out and upgrade currently.  look at how popular vampire survivors has been.  

so now what?   well, with those factors in place amd is shifting focus from the consumer market and slowly clawing at the server market, since the release of ryzen then went from less than 5% market share on servers to 27.7%.   what we probably will see is a huge jump during the q3 calls that they clawed in another 3-5% of the server market.

1662870699,"because a lot of people are fools.

non-dividend, non-voting stocks are effectively useless because they have no utility (as you have rightfully observed). they don't give you anything or let you do anything you couldn't do without them.

there might be some weird situations where you might still get some rights in the event of bankruptcy or other events, or you might have the expectation that, even if the stock doesn't currently pay dividends, it might someday in the future, and so on. 

but barring that, not only are non-dividend/non-voting stocks useless, there is no functional difference between the non-dividend/non-voting stock of one company and that of any other. regardless of how well or poorly google does, if your google stock doesn't give you a share of the profits or a say in how the company functions, it doesn't give you any more a ""share"" of google than a microsoft stock does. and there's no reason to pay more for that google stock than a microsoft stock.

in fact, i would suggest that you don't actually ""own"" anything at all when you hold such a stock, because you gain no enforceable rights by holding it -- you essentially just gave google (or whoever you bought it from) money for nothing.

of course, humans obviously buy *many* useless things. and non-dividend/non-voting stocks are an example of this. there are a lot of people in the world who don't really understand how stocks work and who just assume that, if people are paying money for something, it must have some value. and in a way, it does--it is worth something because people think it is worth something. however, because there is no underlying utility that everybody will always agree is worth at least something, it can just as easily become worthless once people *stop* thinking it's worth something. which can happen at any time for reasons beyond your control.

so people play this game where they buy something useless because they think someone else will pay more for it (and because that buyer similarly expects they will also be able to sell it for more to someone else). 

some people are ruthlessly conscious of this and are just exploiting suckers. some people are just following the crowd because there is an established idea that buying ""stocks"" in a successful company will make you money, and these non-dividend/non-voting shares are called ""stocks"" and are bought and sold in the same exchanges as those that do pay dividends/give voting rights. 

if you don't believe me, then consider this: how many people would pay for a piece of paper that doesn't give them any share of profit or any voting rights in a company if you called that paper a ""commemorative certificate"" instead of a ""stock""? probably far fewer (though sadly some people would still probably buy them). the only reason so many people are okay paying for useless non-dividend/non-voting stock is because we call it a ""stock"", and that name hijacks the historical expectation of what a ""stock"" means and fools people. personally, i think calling such things ""stocks"" is actually a misrepresentation and should be illegal. but the people who decide those things aren't asking me what i think about it, so hey!

it's all very irrational and very stupid, and it drags our real economy down because so many resources are tied up in things that are complete wastes. and while some people do quite well playing this game (they are able to buy non-dividend/non-voting stock and successfully sell it to someone else and use the money to do things), i personally think it's a bad idea to get involved because you have no way of really knowing whether you'll be the sucker who ends up holding the useless stock when the party is over.",1,,helmutye,0
1662871298,"good evening!

hope your day is treating you well. 

thank you for posting your concern here to give us the chance to help you.

to me, your burnout situation is a clear and inevitable end of any person who trades hours for money. 


my teacher robert kiyosaki explains 4 different ways every person gains money. 

i will explain them so you see which ways naturally will exhaust any person over time, and which ways will naturally not exhaust and instead energize you over time.

these ways are explained in a book i highly recommend you reading called, rich dad, poor dad by robert kiyosaki

here is the pdf link to the rich dad poor dad book - http://fop86.com/rich%20dad%20poor%20dad/rich%20dad%20poor%20dad.pdf

the book teaches how a person can grow their wealth powerfully throughout a person‚Äôs life. 

i will now explain the 4 different ways every person gains money as explained in the book.

the 4 different ways a person gains money or grows wealth is this:

1. employee
2. self-employed
3. business owner
4. investor

these 4 different ways are called, the 4 different parts of the cashflow quadrant.

i will happily explain them all.

employees trade hours for money. example. a mcdonalds cashier.

self-employed also trades hours for money. example. a person who created a door repair service business who actively fulfills orders personally. another example is a freelancer who works on fiverr. 

say the front door in the mcdonalds breaks down. mcdonalds calls the door repair service business. and the person who created the door repair service business comes to the mcdonalds personally to fulfill the order.

both employee and self-employed are the highest taxed. and most exhausting because a person is always trading hours aka their time for money. 

and the instant they stop working. the money stops being earned. 

employees and self employed personally effort passionately aka work hard to make money. trading their personal energy endlessly, over years to make money.


employee‚Äôs tax rate can be up to 40% or higher. self-employed‚Äôs tax rate can be up to 60%.

the next 2 parts of the cashflow quadrant are the least exhausting, most energizing.

these next two parts are. business owner and investor.

a business owner builds a system that efforts passionately aka works hard to make money for him.

an investor makes their money effort passionately aka work hard to make more money for them. 

i‚Äôll explain business owner more first. then i‚Äôll explain investor.

business owner will hire other skilled business owners, skilled employees and self employeds to build a business system that passionately efforts to make money for them. 

an example of a business owner. is ray croc the founder of mcdonalds. ray croc along with the people he hired to build mcdonalds, built the system of mcdonalds in a way where he doesn‚Äôt have to personally trade his time to make money.

the countless mcdonalds restaurants that exist. some owned by mcdonalds themselves and some owned by franchisees (aka people who request permission to open a mcdonalds restaurant so they can own a mcdonalds)...

these countless mcdonalds restaurants that exist operate with their own managers, employees. and the profits from every single mcdonalds restaurant goes to mcdonalds headquarters and ray croc. 

to highlight: ray croc doesn‚Äôt trade hours for money.

he built the mcdonalds business system that passionately efforts to make money for him. 

so in your situation. as a lover of food. you could build a restaurant business, hire successful restaurant business owners who have proven they created successful restaurant businesses,  hire skilled employees, managers, self employeds. train them excellently. 

then let the business run while you as the business owner makes money from all the business‚Äôs profits. 

a business owner can operate one restaurant or business or several restaurants or businesses. 

the key here is the business owner built the business system that passionately efforts to make money for him.

so, you as the restaurant business owner has efforted passionately to build a restaurant that works hard to make money for you, instead of you constantly personally trading hours and energy for money as a head chef.

the energizing component of being a business owner is instead of you trading hours for money. 

you could be in bed while the restaurant business opens for the day and makes money for you.

if you note issues wrong with the business. rather than personally dealing with it with your hours, you could hire and train skilled people who will deal with problems as they come. 

this is how facebook, amazon, microsoft is able to operate powerfully and stably over the long term. they use teams of skilled people. 

while mark zuckerberg, jeff bezos, bill gates, after passionately efforting to build their business systems. can now relax and let their business systems passionately effort to make money for them. 

the last part of the cashflow quadrant is an investor. 

an investor makes their money effort passionately  to make more money for them. 

contrasting with an employee and self employed who personally trades their time and energy for money.

example of an investor is. a person who buys dividend paying stocks.

apple stock is a dividend paying stock.

a dividend paying stock is a stock that pays you money just for owning the stock 

apple stock, coca-cola stock are both examples of dividend paying stock.

apple and coca cola both pay a dividend aka money, 4 times a year, to people who own their stock. 

warren buffet‚Äôs berkshire hathaway company bought a great amount of coca cola stock. which means warren buffet gets paid 4 times a year just for owning coca cola stock. 

to give full context. in 2021 warren buffet collected $672,000,000 (672 million dollars) from coca cola just because he owned 400 million coca cola stock.

to put this another way. coca cola paid warren buffet 672 million dollars for just owning 400 million coca cola stock.

another example of an investor is a person who writes a book, puts their book on amazon and whenever their book sells, the person collects money. 

jk rowling, author of harry potter series is an investor in this way.

you as a person who loves food. could write a book about food, or write several books about food. and every time your book sells on amazon, you will gain money.

this is an example of your asset you created with your own money or other people‚Äôs money (bank loan), efforting passionately to make more money for you. 

also known as, making your money effort passionately to make more money for you. which is what an investor is.

business owners and investors are the least exhausted, most energized. because they do not trade their own personal energy and time for money. 

instead a business owner creates a business system and the business system works hard to make money for the business owner

an investor makes their money effort passionately or work hard to make more money for them.

taxes? business owners and investors are the least taxed. the government makes it easy for business owners and investors to be very low taxed and keep the majority of their wealth.

contrasting with employees and self employeds who the government punishes with high taxes. 

everything i have said about employees, self-employeds, business owners and investors is universal. this knowledge applies to every single country and person world-wide.

the tax treatment i mentioned for employees, self employeds, business owners and investors is also worldwide and applies to every single person world wide. 

all the tax numbers i mentioned are united states tax numbers. 

in the united states, business owners have a 20% tax rate. 

investors can have a 0% tax rate. 

0% tax rate for investors is not the default. yet the tax rules allow investors to have a 0% tax rate if they want. which is fascinating. 

even business owners can have 0% tax rate because the tax rules allow business owners to have 0% tax rate even though it is not the default. 

example. amazon paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. 

again. these tax rules are worldwide. 

so, now you know the most exhausting ways to gain money. which are employees and self-employeds.

the most energizing, least exhausting ways to gain money you also know. which are business owners and investors.

since you already have passion for cooking enough to continue for a long while till exhaustion came.

you can definitely pour passion and energy into building a food restaurant business system and being a food related investor by writing a book to make your business system and money effort passionately to make more money for you.

for more amazing details and some of the most lifelong valuable teachings about money. i recommend reading the rich dad poor dad book in the pdf link i pasted earlier.",1,,DanoTheKing,0

these numbers make it clear that the shorts never closed. why would the msm care so much about gme and be constantly reporting on it if it didn't matter? i've been using the apple stock app and it adds news articles relating to stocks you follow and my uranium stocks have had a few jumps based on energy needs from europe recently, but the latest news on them is weeks ago. gme is in the news daily about how it's time to sell. why would they care so much? meme stocks aren't noteworthy by crazy jumps or falls any more, gme has been a bit volatile, but nothing insane for the market, why are they so obsessed with it? 

where there's smoke, there's fire. if they want to create fud on gme, it only serves to further jack my tits. even looking at shit like victor calling in to mad money. when he mentions he bought gme and towelstock, cramer doesn't laugh it off as bullshit, doesn't ridicule the guy, he freezes like a deer in the headlights, weakly tries to deny, then tries to quickly move away from the guy.

you do understand that home prices have soared because of government policies right?  easy money, artificially low rates, reduced down payments, and exotic mortgage products all drive prices up.

your argument is essentially saying that the government should set policies to drive prices up to force people out of their houses with increased property tax rates to collect more and more revenue.

i'm not saying taxes should increase but having them fluctuate directly with pricing is not sensical and not a reliable tax stream (it would also drop significantly in a housing crash)

basically, when you get a cgt bill - say, you sold a lot of apple stock and had ¬£10000 capital gains - you'd have to pay ¬£2000 cgt if you have no other allowances.

instead of just paying,  you could take your ¬£10000 gains, invest them into an eis scheme (such as this one) and ignore  that ¬£2000 cgt liability until when you sell the new eis asset. which could happen many years into the future.

sorry about your situation. i can understand, and i‚Äôve been dead broke for the first half of my life. you have to get to a point where you have a little something extra to pad your life with. if you own property maybe there‚Äôs a way you can create income from airbnb or by turning the garage into a rental or something. i recently sold my house but i used to rent out my back shed. i had it insulated and drywalled and painted. electric run to it and set up w a c tv sofa bed etc. my buddy was even going to set it up w a sink and toilet and shower but we never got that far w it. i‚Äôd allow them in for the guest bathroom. i imagine with a family to worry about the concerns would be different. 
also i like to scalp crypto and sometimes stocks for a quick few bucks. i don‚Äôt recommend doing this with stock options as you can lose your principal. but the losses are more limited on stocks that move on news / earning reports / stockholder meeting etc. w crypto you read the chart like a stock chart but i both invest persistently in a few coins/tokens. the other times i tend to look for a coin or token that‚Äôs recently dropped maybe 10 percent or so and bet on whether it is going back up. sometimes they drop further and you‚Äôre stuck holding that coin till it rebounds or selling at a loss. but oftentimes if you stick to the top 25 or so coins you can make a quick 5-10-25% on whatever you tossed into that coin.  i‚Äôm not too proud to take $103 back from a $100 investment for a week or two. compound that enough times and you have a nice little extra scalped money. also right now we are still technically in a near market w stocks but it looks like we may be coming out of it. google amazon tesla all split recently and just a few shares of any of them should show returns. apple stock is about 160 right now.  it pays dividends plus if you‚Äôre holding onto your shares you will see it explode. in addition to their products they have now there‚Äôs glasses and a car coming out in the next several years. i‚Äôm expecting a true level 3 autonomous electric vehicle that they have set up so
you can let it go be a driverless taxi when it‚Äôs not in use by you, based on a schedule you set. i can imagine your car returned to your garage fully cleaned and charged by the time you need it with a quick look at your apple statement showing you earned 1/6 the entire months car payment by letting it go out one night as you sleep and be a taxi. i could be wrong on those car details but not about it being a future apple device. owning $1000 in apple now may get you 25-50-100k in 10 years. 
don‚Äôt be afraid to apply for any types of grants or such that will let you access a lump sum as long as you aren‚Äôt committing fraud to do so. there‚Äôs nothing shameful about getting help w food and anything else from food banks and foundations. if it frees up a few dollars for investing or even to take care of your family that‚Äôs great.",1,,GriffinA,0

skimming through it, looks like tl;dr:

1. you get 15% of the rebate. robinhood pockets the remaining 85%. before they pocketed 100%. 

2. rebate rates on stock fluctuate daily, and there is no guarantee your shares will be loaned out. it's based on supply and demand. common stuff like $aapl is practically free to short, you'll never earn anything on it. meme stocks and shitco's you might actually earn something. however, then you'd be owning meme stocks and shitcos.

3. you lose voting rights on shares.

4. taxes on divvies are different.

5. if the broker goes tits up, you're fucked.


if you're okay with that, it's free money. honestly it's just another reason not to use robinhood. other brokers give you the same terms, but better splits. for example interactive brokers gives you 50%. if you have a larger account, you can get 100% from places like fidelity.",13,,NathanEpithy,0

1663176270,"if it is more intuitive , think of options (put or calls) as stocks trading at a price, or a premium in options' world.

calls
when you buy a stock - you can say i am long apple, you make money when it goes up or lose when it goes down. call options behave in the same way - you buy a call option, pay a price (premium), you are buying an option to purchase a stock at a certain price (excercise price) in the future, limited by time frame within which you may exercise that option, say 6 months.

puts
long put = long an option to sell apple, or other company, at a certain excercise price. say you are long an $appl put at $120. it means you get to sell the underlying aplle stock at $120. so if appl drops to $100, you get to sell the option still at $120. hence, when apple stock price goes down, your option to sell it at $120 increases in value.

now you can be short a stock, just like you can be ahort an option.

short call option = selling an option contract at a premium (price). you collect the premium but it comes qith the obligation to sell aplle at the excercise price to whoever is ""long"" the call. so like,  you sold a call option at $120 excercise price, price goes to $200, you are obligated to sell aplle stock at $120. obviously, your counterparty is able to buy from you at $120 and sell at tge current market price in the mkt for $200. thus collecting the $80 difference. which by the way is one of the drivers of prwmium. other factors come into play, but might be a good start to think of it in those terms.

short a put = you've sold the option for someone else to sell the stock to you at an excercise price. yvalue of your position increases when stock goes up, and decreses when sto price drops because someone else has the right to sell the stock to you at the excercise lrice. you soled the put at $120, stock has come down to $100, when counterparty excercise (sells stock to you) the lut, they have the right to sell to you at $120. and you must buy.",1,,kewboo,0

i‚Äôm sorry but i feel like there‚Äôs a lot of people speaking about vr, who haven‚Äôt actually tried them or don‚Äôt play games.

when i can load up gta on my vr headset and run about murdering folk, or when i can play fifa and feel like i‚Äôm actually in the game, ok i‚Äôll buy meta stock 

indeed, the issue i see with vr is it‚Äôs just kinda hard to do.

for one, if it‚Äôs super immersive, you‚Äôre only going to play at home, which is fine, but at that point i may as well have an entire rig where i can physically be in the metaverse, like on some sort of hamster wheel like existence, moving in space. none of that is feasible or realistic.

so, it‚Äôs going to be semi mobile, in which case, i can‚Äôt have it be too immersive or it‚Äôs just overwhelming. i can‚Äôt be on the train getting robbed and shit while in the metaverse.

there are mods, its kinda hard to find because the community is small, but they are there. you can turn anything, gta, fear, etc. technollogicaly it is easy to turn game to vr.

&gt;when i can load up gta on my vr headset and run about murdering folk, or when i can play fifa and feel like i‚Äôm actually in the game, ok i‚Äôll buy meta stock. i have tried a few vr headsets, have a friend who is designing a game for vr, and it‚Äôs just really not fun at all. and, it sounds like you have an entire pc setup. are the masses going to have that!? how‚Äôs that mobile? should it even be mobile?

standalone vr is in the current version gimmick. did you try alyx on airlink on high end pc?

if masses buy iphones for 1k usd they will buy pc or console for hyper realistic vr. but pcvr is still young software wise and it is not directed towards idiots, so you dont see them buying pc's or consoles for vr in masses.

about mobility, you play wireless in your room. 

&gt;for one, if it‚Äôs super immersive, you‚Äôre only going to play at home, which is fine, but at that point i may as well have an entire rig where i can physically be in the metaverse, like on some sort of hamster wheel like existence, moving in space. none of that is feasible or realistic.

you do not need hamster wheel, when you move, you move in the game, so you need biger room (and use joystick when you get to the border of the room), you cant obviously sprint, but it is still fun.

&gt;how is the tech ready? i‚Äôd buy a vr headset today if it wasn‚Äôt absolute garbage. there‚Äôs no games anyone wants to play on vr.when i can load up gta on my vr headset and run about murdering folk, or when i can play fifa and feel like i‚Äôm actually in the game, ok i‚Äôll buy meta stock.

you can get such experience with alyx on high end pc. alyx works because:
1. game is in closed space
2. it is insanely well optimized.

the problem is with other games such as gta or skyrim that for the clarity in the distance (15 meters+) you need higher resolution or it will look like shit. you could buy reaaaaaally expensive pc and supersample the shit out of it + better headset and you might get there.

but the main point was that now you can get the mind blowing experience everyone has on mind with alyx on high end pc. and once hardware will improve and get cheaper (mainly gpu) you could get alyx experience playing gta or skyrim. headsets will improve too.

the short answer is yes, the law requires corporations to maximize stock value for their shareholders and gives major shareholders the tools to enforce that. people will argue that maximizing shareholder‚Äôs value takes away from maximizing corporate and consumer value. the common place where people point is enron, where management went so far that they even committed fraud to look better for their shareholders. 

however in practice, maximizing value for shareholders and maximizing value for customers is one and the same. the reason apple stock is so high is because investors buy the stock. investors buy the stock because they know consumers will buy apple products. that‚Äôs why apple the company will focus on making better products for its customers to drive better results and deliver a higher share price. in exchange for a higher share price, apple has greater access to capital which further enables them to succeed. however, since it involves humans there are inherently flaws in the system. people on both sides will try to exploit loopholes for their own gain. overall though it is fairly efficient.",1,,bunnite,0

oh quite the 'intelligent' investor we have amongst us. pray do tell how do you make the investment knowing 100% in advance that it is going to beat inflation? kindly do enlighten us lesser mortals on those avenues of investments that as-a-given will always beat inflation. and kindly do not say equity because for whatever little it is us poor uneducated folks do know is that when you say that you're essentially throwing two variables into the mix - equity and inflation, so i'd like to know how is any investor to know before hand he will hands down beat inflation?

&gt; for the uneducated, a ""premium"" is the difference between the stock's nominal price and the current price

the uneducated would also like to point out, premium is a very subjective word and can have various meanings. very convenient for you to delve into the text-book definition to suit your needs but even when you would like to reign in text-book definitions to support your argument you seem to have failed. rather if you had stuck to 'garbage' here meaning absurd or too high it would still leave your argument comprehensible. as of now i can't distinguish the head or the tail of your argument. i am guessing what you mean when you say nominal value or par value is the face value. and premium suggests the difference in the face value and last market traded price for that security. rarely does a share trade below it's nominal/face value. the closest one green/renweable energy related stock that is trading close to its face value is suzlon and even that company is not a pure green energy play but rather an infra play and is as a matter of fact trading above it's nominal value and at a premium. the others that i can think of are tata power, adani green energy, adani enterprises, borosil renewables, ntpc listed on the indian exchanges and all of them are trading at a massive premium to their nominal value suggesting like you said a market expectation of incoming and maybe sustained high growth and others like renew power which are an india play but listed abroad and still ablve nominal value. if you're by any chance(obviously not) referring to nhpc and sjvn they trade at lesser premiums like all psu's do.

&gt; in which country were you talking about semiconductors being growth companies? i'm looking at both $intc and $nvda and their 5 year numbers aren't that exciting.

$nvda is a fabless company and not a semiconductor foundry that only designs the chips and outsources the manufacturing to a foundry say for example tsmc(taiwan semiconductor). so they don't have a lot of control over the industry/costs. as a matter of fact they're at the mercy of chip makers. $intc designs and makes its own chips but it's financials are not as strong as pure-fab foundries because of its loss in market dominance and issues with chip design and manufacture where in its not being able to compete with below 14nm chips which $amd designs and outsources the manufacturing of(note : $amd used to make its own chips but found a better edge and business model in design and outsourcing fabrication and was hence able to snatch market share from $intc)

if we are talking semiconductors and chips let's talk about the real players who do the actual heavy lifting and i'll just take the example of the first name that will come right off the bat which is tsmc. here's the text of the first result from a simple google search of ""tsmc last 5 years revenue growth"" and i'll leave it for you/you all to decipher and make what you will of it :

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing revenue for the quarter ending june 30, 2022 was¬†$18.161b, a¬†36.33% increase¬†year-over-year.

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing revenue for the twelve months ending june 30, 2022 was¬†$66.691b, a¬†25.36% increase¬†year-over-year.

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing annual revenue for 2021 was¬†$57.225b, a¬†19.98% increase¬†from 2020.

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing annual revenue for 2020 was¬†$47.694b, a¬†33.32% increase¬†from 2019.

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing annual revenue for 2019 was¬†$35.774b, a¬†6.17% increase¬†from 2018.

mind you, this is just one example, you're free to do your own research on other actual taiwanese and chinese chip-makers and foundries and not fabless companies to get a better idea about the industry. also do note that raw materials for these foundries had shot up massively during which time they were still able to grow revenues by 18-35%. not to mention none of these digital businesses would even exist without the chip makers.

and next time you have a go at someone with what numbers excite you and what numbers don't, first do your research and due diligence on the subject and if you can't/won't or don't have enough information, there's never any harm in admitting you're less informed or unaware about something. anyway, good day!",1,,doughslingerTT,0

1663337447,"also by dzogchen teacher acarya malcolm smith:  
here, the nirvana sutra clearly and precisely states that buddha-svabhaava, the ""nature of a buddha"" refers not to an actual nature but a potential. why, it continues:  
""child of the lineage, i have said that ‚Äòcurd exists in milk‚Äô, because curd is produced from milk, it is called ‚Äòcurd‚Äô.  
child of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there is no butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the curd arises from milk with the conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have the ‚Äòcurd-nature‚Äô.""  
so one must be quite careful not to make an error. the lanka states unequivocably that the tathagatagarbha doctrine is merely a device to lead those who grasp at a true self the inner meaning of the dharma, non-arising, the two selflessnesses and so on, and explains the meaning of the literal examples some people constantly err about:  
""similarly, that tathaagatagarbha taught in the suutras spoken by the bhagavan, since the completely pure luminous clear nature is completely pure from the beginning, possessing the thirty two marks, the bhagavan said it exists inside of the bodies of sentient beings.  
when the bhagavan described that‚Äì like an extremely valuable jewel thoroughly wrapped in a soiled cloth, is thoroughly wrapped by cloth of the aggregates, aayatanas and elements, becoming impure by the conceptuality of the thorough conceptuality suppressed by the passion, anger and ignorance ‚Äì as permanent, stable and eternal, how is the bhagavan‚Äôs teaching this as the tathaagatagarbha is not similar with as the assertion of self of the non-buddhists?  
bhagavan, the non-buddhists make assertion a self as ‚Äúa permanent creator, without qualities, pervasive and imperishable‚Äù.  
the bhagavan replied:  
‚Äúmahaamati, my teaching of tathaagatagarbha is not equivalent with the assertion of the self of the non-buddhists.  
mahaamati, the tathaagata, arhat, samyak sambuddhas, having demonstrated the meaning of the words ""emptiness, reality limit, nirvana, non-arisen, signless"", etc. as tathaagatagarbha for the purpose of the immature complete forsaking the perishable abodes, demonstrate the expertiential range of the non-appearing abode of complete non-conceptuality by demonstrating the door of tathaagatagarbha.  
mahaamati, a self should not be perceived as real by bodhisattva mahaasattvas enlightened in the future or presently.  
mahaamati, for example, a potter, makes one mass of atoms of clay into various kinds containers from his hands, craft, a stick, thread and effort.  
mahaamati, similarly, although tathaagatas avoid the nature of conceptual selflessness in dharmas, they also appropriately demonstrate tathaagatagarbha or demonstrate emptiness by various kinds \[of demonstrations\] possessing praj√±aa and skillful means; like a potter, they demonstrate with various enumerations of words and letters. as such, because of that,  
mahaamati, the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha is not similar with the self demonstrated by the non-buddhists.  
mahaamati, the tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those grasping to assertions of the self of the non-buddhists, will demonstrate tathaagatagarbha with the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha. how else will the sentient beings who have fallen into a conceptual view of a true self, possess the thought to abide in the three liberations and quickly attain the complete manifestation of buddha in unsurpassed perfect, complete enlightenment?""  
thus, the lanka says:  
all yaanas are included  
in five dharmas, three natures,  
eight consciousnesses,  
and two selflessnesses  
it does not add anything about a true self and so on.  
if one accepts that tathaagatagarbha is the aalayavij\~naana, and one must since it is identified as such, then one is accepting that it is conditioned and afflicted and evolves, thus the lanka states:  
tathaagatagarbha, known as ‚Äòthe all-base consciousness‚Äô, is to be completely purified.  
mahaamati, if what is called the all-base consciousness were (37/a) not connected to the tathaagatagarbha, because the tathaagatagarbha would not be ‚Äòthe all-base consciousness‚Äô, although it would be not be engaged, it also would not evolve; mahaamati, it is engaged by both the childish and aaryas, that also evolves.  
because great yogins, the ones not abandoning effort, abide with blissful conduct in this at the time of personally knowing for themselves‚Ä¶the tathaagatagarbha-all basis consciousness is the sphere of the tathaagatas; it is the object which also is the sphere of teachers, \[those\] of detailed and learned inclinations like you, and bodhisattva mahaasattvas of analytic intellect.  
and:  
although tathaagatagarbha  
possesses seven consciousnesses;  
always engaged with dualistic apprehensions  
\[it\] will evolve with thorough understanding.  
if one accepts that the tathaagatagarbha is unconditioned and so on, and one must, since it is identified as such other sutras state:  
""\`saariputra, the element of sentient beings denotes the word tathaagatagarbha.  
\`saariputra, that word ‚Äòtathaagatagarbha‚Äô denotes dharmakaaya.  
and:  
\`saariputra, because of that, also the element of sentient beings is not one thing and the dharmakaaya another; the element of sentient beings itself is dharmakaaya; dharmakaaya itself is the element of sentient beings.  
then one cannot accept it as the aalayavij\~naana-- or worse, one must somehow imagine that something conditioned somehow becomes conditioned.  
other sutras state that tathaagatagarbha is the citta, as the angulimaala suutra does here:  
""although in the \`sraavakayaana it is shown as ‚Äòmind‚Äô, the meaning of the teaching is ‚Äòtathaagatagarbha‚Äô; whatever mind is naturally pure, that is called ‚Äòtathaagatagarbha‚Äô.  
so, one must understand that these sutras are provisional and definitive, each giving different accounts of the tathaagatagarbha for different students, but they are not defintive. understood improperly, they lead one into a non-buddhist extremes. understood and explained properly, they lead those afraid of the profound praj\~naapaaramitaa to understanding it's sublime truth. in other words, the buddha nature teaching is just a skillful means as the nirvana sutra states  
""child of the lineage, buddha-nature is like this; although the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses, compassion, and the three foundations of mindfulness are the three aspects existing in sentient beings; \[those\] will be newly seen when defilements are thoroughly conquered. the possessors of perversion will newly attain the ten powers (44/b) and four fearlessness, great compassion and three foundations of mindfulness having thoroughly conquered perversion.  
because that is the purpose as such, i teach buddha-nature always exists in all sentient beings.  
when one can compare and contrast all of these citations, and many more side by side, with the proper reading of the uttataratantra, one will see the propositions about these doctrines by the dark zen fools and others of their ilk are dimmed like stars at noon.  
............  
   
lankavatara sutra then states:  
""o mahƒÅmati, with a view to casting aside the heterodox theory, you must treat the tathƒÅgatagarbha as not self (anƒÅtman).",3,,xabir,0

xfx exclusively produces radeon cards, and maybe that's why over the last few months they've consistently been undercutting the market on radeon price points.

maybe because they understand their specific and fluctuating market and the dangers of not staying competitive, or perhaps radeon cards weathered supply chain markups a lot better giving xfx a cost advantage to undercut rivals burdened with nvidia stock.

i'd leave school, skip army stuff, skip college stuff and just work as a laborer. putting every penny into investments. that way, by the time i'm 25 i'm retired with more money than i could ever spend. 

personal growth wise? don't be so angry. you've been through a lot, but shit, so has everyone. stay stupid. trust me, those dumbasses are the happiest motherfuckers on earth. oh also, make sure to play on vashj eu. and gank xxxxxxxx as you go on to marry that chick. (i'd want the same wife)

i'd like to warn people about 911, but i honestly don't think anyone would believe me and or have the potential to be tied to the attack for having prior knowledge of it. however someone once mentioned that calling in fake bomb threats on the world trade center that morning would have forced clearing the buildings before they opened to workers. also calling the fbi tip line weeks and days before detailing what's about to happen. especially if you specify the names of the terrorists, and link them to osama bin laden prior to anything happening. potentially preventing a war in iraq and afghanistan, and having one target in the form of a mad man.

much later the big one for me is how you can lie on the internet and people would believe you. people telling lies for political gain and a rather large amount of the population just believe what they see without question. i got into an argument with one of my high school classmates about wind energy. we teach this stuff, but he read somewhere and was convinced that they would never exist at all without the government paying for them. i even pointed out that many other countries use them, it didn't help.

sept is seasonally the weakest month  -- using a histogram you can see this seasonal weakness over time repeat itself.  from what i have read 140-145 might be offered

the economy and further fed moves this tuesday and wednesday  and then the later release of fed minutes will definitely have an effect on the market.  

the last several fed hikes have seen head fake rises and the quick sell offs days late as further tightening is estimated

right now the stock market has been for day traders getting in and out.  some big guns at big banks and investment houses have suggested a flat  10years. i don't expect that at all.

but i do expect a recession and further bigger fed rate hikes and these will affect apple stock price short term.  i also have a contrarian view on the fed letting those hikes stay in place for longer than mr market suggests 

 it's all guessing based on reading lots of sources that i agree and disagree with

blabbering cut short, you will do best if you dca slow
y through this year and the next.  it's less thrilling but your chances of green success are greater historically 

there are some free trading platforms that let you auto buy stocks once a week,every two weeks or once a month.  over time you let it run providing you keep depositing money in the account

mark zuckerberg‚Äôs pivot into the metaverse has cost him dearly in the real world.
even in a rough year for just about every us tech titan, the wealth erased from the chief executive officer of meta platforms inc. stands out. his fortune has been cut in half and then some, dropping by $71 billion so far this year, the most among the ultra-rich tracked by the bloomberg billionaires index. at $55.9 billion, his net worth ranks 20th among global billionaires, his lowest spot since 2014 and behind three waltons and two members of the koch family. 


falling fast
zuckerberg's $71 billion wealth decline has dropped him 14 spots in list of world's richest



it was less than two years ago when zuckerberg, 38, was worth $106 billion and among an elite group of global billionaires, with only jeff bezos and bill gates commanding bigger fortunes. his wealth swelled to a peak of $142 billion in september 2021, when the company‚Äôs shares reached as high as $382. 
the following month, zuckerberg introduced meta and changed the company‚Äôs name from facebook inc. and it‚Äôs been largely downhill from there as it struggles to find its footing in the tech universe.
its recent earnings reports have been dismal. it started in february, when the company revealed no growth in monthly facebook users, triggering a historic collapse in its stock price and slashing zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune by $31 billion, among the biggest one-day declines in wealth ever. other issues include instagram‚Äôs bet on reels ‚Äî its answer to tiktok‚Äôs short-form video platform ‚Äî even though it‚Äôs worth less in advertising revenue, while the industry overall has been affected by lower marketing spending due to concerns over an economic slowdown.
the stock is also being dragged down by the company‚Äôs investments in the metaverse, said laura martin, senior internet analyst at needham &amp; co. zuckerberg has said he expects the project will lose ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù amounts of money in the next three to five years.
in the meantime, meta ‚Äúhas to get these users back from tiktok,‚Äù said martin. it‚Äôs also hampered by ‚Äúexcessive regulatory scrutiny and intervention,‚Äù she said.
the menlo park, california-based company is faring worse in 2022 than most of its faang peers. it‚Äôs down about 57% this year, far more than the declines of 14% for apple inc., 26% for amazon.com inc. and 29% for google parent alphabet inc. meta is even narrowing the gap in 2022 losses with netflix inc., which is down about 60%.
if not for its endeavor into virtual reality, the social media giant ‚Äúwould be more in line with where alphabet is,‚Äù said mandeep singh, technology analyst at bloomberg intelligence. meta could circumvent this issue by spinning off some of its other businesses, like whatsapp or instagram, he said.
almost all of zuckerberg‚Äôs wealth is tied up in meta stock. he holds more than 350 million shares, according to the company‚Äôs latest proxy statement. the price was little changed at $146.18 at 12:22 p.m. in new york.
zuckerberg has attempted a rebranding of sorts. he recently uploaded a video of himself practicing mixed martial arts and repeatedly referred to himself as a ‚Äúproduct designer‚Äù in a three-hour conversation on joe rogan‚Äôs podcast.

1663663758,"caveat: i'm not a financial professional.

that depends on exactly what you mean, but in the case of companies with aggressive stock buyback schemes (which have accelerated in the 21st century, due to deregulation by reagan), they own things of greater value and things that are rarer. if we both have 10 stocks of ge and the going market value is $10, but for some reason, i buy your 10 stocks for $100 a piece, that means that the ""price"" of all of those ge shares just shot up an order of magnitude, so if ge owns a lot of its own stock, on paper, it just got very wealthy.

how exactly to realize those gains with something like stocks is a complicated and potentially very illegal thing. for instance, if the market now somehow thinks that ge is really ""worth"" 10 times what it was worth before, ge can sell a small portion of its stock at this new price and get an injection of cash for free. they did nothing to in any way improve the economy, solve problems, or innovate: they just moved money around on a ledger and manipulated finance to their advantage. needless to say, doing this in a coordinated manner to manipulate the market or engage in a pump and dump scheme is wildly illegal, but on some scales, who can prove that? who will investigate or prosecute it?

many large companies now do this just to make money on paper rather than do things like hire new workers, raise wages of existing workers or provide better benefits, open new factories, or innovate new products which materially impact the economy and actually help someone other than stockholders. while apple have released m1 and m2 chips recently, which is genuinely innovative, for quite a few years, they did not release any truly industry-changing products, but they engaged in a lot of stock buybacks. and if they purchase their own stock and hold it, that refusal to sell means that there are effectively fewer stocks on the market, and the rarer something is, the higher its price will be. this may be legal, but it provides no value to anyone other than the fraction of a percent who owns apple stock. they can also then leverage this wealth on paper for things like getting huge lines of credit, never paying it off, and sticking everyone else with the bill. they can also [leverage this mammoth credit for schemes that mostly benefit themselves and sometimes have an impact on the economy at large](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/06/29/5-ways-rich-people-use-credit.aspx).

alternately, these companies can also use their inflated wealth on paper to actually encourage more real investment. as always, how the rich *use* money and what constitutes *wealth* for them is not the same as us: the rich have nothing in common with you and me and they leverage the law, class warfare, and intentionally obscure financial instruments (e.g. spacs) for their own benefit.

so yes, in short, me buying your ge stocks at an inflated price (or any price really) doesn't directly give ge money, but it gives them some useful leverage to generate wealth using legal, semi-legal, or illegal schemes.",10,,koavf,0

mark zuckerberg‚Äôs $71¬†billion wealth wipeout puts focus on meta‚Äôs woes

nur dayana mustak

3 - 4 minutes

12:41 am ist, 20 sep 20227:07 am ist, 20 sep 202212:41 am ist, 20 sep 20227:07 am ist, 20 sep 2022

(bloomberg) -- mark zuckerberg‚Äôs pivot into the metaverse has cost him dearly in the real world.

even in a rough year for just about every us tech titan, the wealth erased from the¬†chief executive officer of¬†meta platforms inc. stands out. his fortune has been cut in half and then some, dropping by $71¬†billion so far this year, the most among the ultra-rich tracked by the bloomberg billionaires index. at $55.9 billion, his net worth ranks¬†20th among global billionaires, his lowest spot since 2014 and behind three¬†waltons and two members of the koch family.¬†

it was less than two years ago when¬†zuckerberg, 38, was worth $106 billion and among an elite group of global billionaires, with¬†only jeff bezos and bill gates commanding bigger fortunes.¬†his wealth swelled to a peak of $142 billion in september 2021, when the company‚Äôs shares reached as high as¬†$382.¬†

the following month, zuckerberg introduced meta and changed the company‚Äôs name from facebook inc. and it‚Äôs been largely downhill from there as it struggles to find its footing in the tech universe.

its recent¬†earnings reports have been dismal. it started in february, when the company revealed no growth in monthly facebook users, triggering a historic collapse in its stock price and slashing zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune by $31 billion, among the biggest one-day declines in wealth ever. other issues include¬†instagram‚Äôs bet¬†on reels ‚Äî¬†its answer to tiktok‚Äôs short-form video platform¬†‚Äî¬†even though it‚Äôs worth less in advertising revenue, while the industry overall has been affected by lower marketing spending¬†due to concerns over an economic slowdown.

the stock is also being dragged down by the company‚Äôs investments in the metaverse, said¬†laura martin, senior internet analyst at needham &amp; co.¬†zuckerberg has said he expects the project will lose¬†‚Äúsignificant‚Äù amounts of money in the next three to five years.

in the meantime, meta ‚Äúhas to get these users back from tiktok,‚Äù said martin.¬†it‚Äôs also hampered by ‚Äúexcessive regulatory scrutiny and intervention,‚Äù she said.

the menlo park, california-based company¬†is faring worse in 2022 than most of its faang peers. it‚Äôs down about 57% this year, far more than the declines of 14% for apple inc., 26% for amazon.com inc. and 29% for google parent alphabet inc. meta is even narrowing the gap in 2022 losses with netflix inc., which is down about 60%.

if not for its endeavor into virtual reality, the social media giant ‚Äúwould be more in line with where alphabet is,‚Äù¬†said mandeep singh, technology analyst at bloomberg intelligence. meta could circumvent this issue by¬†spinning off some of its other businesses, like whatsapp or instagram, he said.

almost all of zuckerberg‚Äôs wealth is tied up in meta stock. he holds more than 350 million shares, according to the company‚Äôs latest proxy statement. the price was little changed at $146.18 at 12:22¬†p.m. in new york.

zuckerberg¬†has attempted a rebranding of sorts. he recently¬†uploaded a video of himself practicing mixed martial arts and repeatedly referred to himself as a ‚Äúproduct designer‚Äù in a three-hour conversation on¬†joe rogan‚Äôs podcast.",15,,WasabiForDinner,0

1663684147,"that's how short-sales work, both in stocks and in derivatives.

basically a short-sale is this: you borrow the stock (or derivative) from someone else and sell it immediately with the intention to buy it back and return it later (or with the intention that it becomes worthless and can just be written off later with some derivatives).

for a case of that in stock: let's say i think microsoft ($msft) is overpriced.  i might borrow 100 shares and sell them to someone else (who thinks it's not overpriced).  i collect the spot value of the 100 shares in cash...but owe someone else 100 shares of $msft (that i borrowed).  if it goes down (like i'm anticipating), i can buy those shares later at a lower price, return them, and pocket the difference.  if it goes up, eventually i'll likely have to buy those shares later at a higher price to return them...and eat the difference as a loss.

for a case of that in derivatives, applying the same logic to a call option on microsoft that expires in 10 days at a strike price of $250/share.  if i'm shorting that option, i collect the value of the call option now with the hope that $msft will be at or below $250/share in 10 days.  if it is, the option expires worthless (because nobody's going to use an option to buy it at $250/share when you can buy it on the open market for less) and i can write off the liability (b/c it's now $0 as the option is worthless).

in both cases, notice that i'm selling something that's not mine (in the first case i'm borrowing the stock then selling it, in the latter i'm borrowing the option then selling it), hence ""sold, not yet purchased.""",3,,evil_little_elves,0

that has increased to cagr of 17.6% from 2014-2022.

1. first off, the people using p/e clearly don't understand the purpose of p/e. you don't use p/e to measure the profitability of a company that isn't quite designed to be as profitable as possible. this same reason is why many of you would have never bought apple, amazon, etc., at their early stages and would have made enough $ to retire by now. 
2. ""but their market cap is higher than all the other automakers combined."" that's because traditionally, auto companies have never been valued highly in the market. why? because it's a low-growth business... the market was saturated with ice vehicles, no differentiation between products, and a lack of innovation. hence, people didn't really care for the auto companies in the markets. it was boring and while they made good profit that was being distributed via dividends, people largely stayed away from auto companies. just look a their historical stock performance... the ath for ford was two decades ago. and a lot of you might not realize this but in 2008, gm and chrysler got hit badly. why? because consumer financing with a broken economy meant gm and chrysler had a pile of debt that consumers couldn't pay off. these auto companies are highly leveraged. a bad economy means they will have piles of vehicles that consumers can't afford to finance again.
3. tesla changed the auto industry. this is undeniable. ask yourself, when was the last time the auto industry was this interesting? when was the last time you saw these auto companies actually start to innovate? never, until tesla shook the market. and that's why people are betting highly on tesla. they're the ones innovating in a brand new industry. and yes, ev's are a brand new industry. it's why auto companies are spending billions trying to revamp or create new manufacturing plants. it's why they are having huge supply chain shortages particularly for ev's. it's why gm had to pause sales on their chevy bolt for over 7 months because they had an exploding battery issue. new industry, not the same as ice. same way renewable energy products are different from oil. both can be used as energy generation fuel but they are entirely different in composition. ford's ceo even openly admits that they are trying to copy tesla. gm's ceo, mary barra, her entire ev strategy is literally what tesla did..... like 6 years ago.
4. what's the p/e of vw, ford, gm, toyota, honda, etc., if you only include their ev segment? because that's what matters here and that is what many of you are are missing. tesla isn't in the business of competing against other ev companies as much as they are in the business of taking market share from ice companies. right now, outside of luxury ev models such as the porsche taycan, there are no profitable ev's other than tesla's. and it will be that way for many more years. so if you're going to be fair and start comparing p/e of these ev initiatives, at least look at the broader comparison. why compare ice vehicles, a dying industry, to ev vehicles? look across the board: almost every auto company in the world are looking to stop selling ice vehicles by 2040 (latest). california already plans to ban ice sales by 2035. using the p/e and market cap of an ice company to compare against an ev company is the same logic as saying 'why buy apple stock when they released the iphone instead of nokia?' they both sold phones and nokia had a much larger revenue/profit than apple at that time. there were many apple pessimists who made such claims... stating that no one wanted a touch screen phone, it's a fad, it won't last, etc., 
5. tesla already has the highest margins in the auto business outside of exotic luxury vehicles. think about it from this perspective: while other auto companies lose money for every ev they sell, tesla makes the highest in the industry for every ev they sell. that's because tesla is the most vertically integrated auto company in the world dating back to the fact that many of their parts couldn't be purchased elsewhere and they had to use cost-saving measures due to the fact that they were on the verge of bankruptcy. that mindset led to tesla constantly innovating in engineering. their gigastamp is a revolutionary process in creating the vehicle chassis and significantly reduces costs. even the car seats are made by tesla. the software, made by tesla. batteries are made by tesla and with strong emphasis on 4680, they will likely be one of the biggest battery makers in the future as well. auto companies historically do not do this type of shit. they are just assembly lines. they get the parts and build the car. while that's a good thing for ice, it's a bad thing for ev's. software is the biggest key here. vw recently came out and stated that their software will likely be outsourced to apple instead... aka, apple carplay. they don't even know how to improve their software. meanwhile, tesla is capable of creating software allowing them to play steam games, push ota updates to perform self-driving features, improve vehicle performance, improve firmware for their cameras. much like how you would buy a laptop or phone, the software capabilities for a vehicle will largely be the differentation as competition increases.
6. tesla is already going to be the most profitable auto company in the u.s. by this year. by next year, they will be the most profitable auto company in the world. for reference, tesla only became profitable on an annual basis in 2020. so in a span of five years, they would have went from being unprofitable to being the most profitable auto company. the numbers are insane when you look at it... per vehicle sold, tesla is already the most profitable company. automakers like vw and toyota largely made vehicles that are low profit-per-unit but they earn money through high volume. if they can't push towards more ev sales in the future, they are going to be toast. bmw and benz are high profit automakers. yet, neither of them sell any ev's that are affordable compared to their ice version. the performance of those ice versions also significantly outperform their ev's so in a sense, there is no incentive to purchase their ev's currently. toyota doesn't even believe in bev's. they are still of the mindset that hydrogen fuel is the way to go because after spending billions of $, they are too stubborn to admit it was a failure. all they push out are hybrids and they did so because they wanted to meet the regulatory standards and not be hit with a carbon tax. they are falling behind..... so let me guess, tesla is a cult? in two years, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world while selling a product (ev's) that other automakers will  be losing money selling. sign me up!
7. i've been investing in tesla since 2014... believe me, the amount of criticism that tesla gets today pales in comparison to what they received in 2018 when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. this is peanuts. it went from, 'ev's are a fad, tesla can't mass manufacture ev's, they will be bankrupt, they're only profitable because of regulatory credits, other competition is coming (oh, really, the same automakers who pledge to go fully ev in 15 years but the competition is coming...?). heard it all by now. this isn't anything new. 
8. not even going to go on about their energy storage capabilities, supercharging network, ai expertise (currently the largest ai company in the world), robotics (watch their ai event next week), tesla insurance, no dealership model, fsd, etc.,... those are things you can either choose to believe or not believe in. i'm more focused on the fact that they are the only company even willing to engage in all of this. that shows me a company that is constantly innovating. the very fact tesla does all this while other automakers don't should tell you one thing: they don't have the expertise nor are they focused on shareholder value. hence, why auto companies have been terrible performers in the stock market for the past two decades until tesla ignited the ev formula and now you're seeing companies like byd, nio, xpeng, lucid, rivian, etc., all pop up trying to take market from the ice segment. remember, they are not competing against each other as much as they are competing for the ice sales.

this dude runs a company that builds rockets and wants to take civilization to mars.... think about that for a second. you might say it's stupid and i would probably agree with you. but this is the type of person you are dealing with. once he stepped into the auto business, it became revolutionized. once he went into the aero industry, he revolutionized it. this is not a person you want to bet against and the market will find that even more evident when tesla and spacex both become top five companies in the world by market cap.",152,,Apart-Bad-5446,1

1663690102,"this isn't flip-flopping, you're just confused about the timeline of events and what's happening:

1. crypto shits bed. mining demand goes down.
2. glut of 3000 series chips starts to pile up in nvidia warehouses. glut of 3000 series boards piles up in aib partner warehouses and retailer warehouses and shelf space.
3. some miners start selling gpus in response to eventual release of ethereum proof of stake change.
4. nvidia tries to lower tsmc wafer orders to artificially control supply to keep margins fat.
5. nancy pelosi visits taiwan. sells nvidia stock.
6. us weighs sanctions on china to prevent invasion of taiwan.
7. ethereum moves to proof of stake. gpu mining dies in under 24 hours.
8. nvidia sees writing on the wall. asks for tsmc order sped up to prevent possible price / supply disruption on 4000 series.
9. **you are here**.
10. gpu prices crater over the coming 30-180 days as miners slowly realize that gpu mining **will never** be a thing again.

none of this is flip-flopping.

we haven't seen the full fallout from timeline item #10 yet, but it's coming.

over the past 2 years, over 100 million gpus were sold. and we all know they didn't all go to gamers... and i'm pretty sure that figure doesn't cover the gpus sold directly to miners.

if china invades taiwan, the united states has to go to war with china, because the western world can't allow china to have control of tsmc. too much of our economy and computing infrastructure come from there. nvidia wants 4000 series chips to be scarce **but under their control**. they **don't** want scarcity because china has invaded taiwan and is how hoarding all their 4000 series chips. that's bad scarcity... because they can't sell those chips. they can trickle out 4000 series chips **but only if they're in nvidia's control**.",7,,Rathadin,0

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;enter after two consecutive green candles (for longs) or red candles (for shorts).

that entry sounds like it is way too late. you should be getting in near the close of the reversal candle (aggressive), or the very next candle which takes out the reversal candle's high (confirmation). lower timeframe typically means earlier entry.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i also end up with an unfavourable risk to reward ratio - my stop loss is 0.3-0.5% below/above vwap while my take profit is just below the previous swing high/low.

the late entry is most likely the reason why your r2r is not favorable. if a stock is truly trending, the prior swing high/low should be taken out. it's a good place to take partial if you want to secure profits, however.

**can chip giant nvidia shrug off china sales ban?**

***the share price for chip giant nvidia (nvda) has fallen more than 53% year-to-date***

analysts have reduced their price targets after the company revised down its earnings outlook in august, and the us government-imposed restrictions on nvidia selling chips to china and russia.

*is now a good time to trade the stock?*

**history of nvidia**

nvidia was founded in the us in 1993 by electrical engineers jensen huang, chris malachowsky and curtis priem. huang currently serves as the company‚Äôs ceo, malachowsky remains a senior executive and priem retired from the company in 2003.

nvidia invented the graphics processing unit (gpu) in 1999, a high-performance processor that generates interactive graphics for virtual reality, high performance computing and artificial intelligence (ai).

nvidia reported its first $1bn-revenue quarter in 2007 and shipped its 1 billionth graphics processor in 2011.

in september 2020, the company announced plans to acquire uk chip designer arm from japanese investment firm softbank (9984) for $40bn. however, the deal collapsed under opposition from uk regulatory authorities, with nvidia announcing the termination of the transaction on 7 february 2022.

on 6 may, the us securities and exchange commission (sec) agreed a $5.5m settlement with nvidia over the company‚Äôs failure to disclose in 2018 that cryptocurrency mining was a significant source of revenues from sales of its gpus designed for gaming.

nvidia stock slumps on as trade war compounds slowdown

based on nvda stock historical prices, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $334.12 on 29 november 2021, with lockdowns around the world increasing demand for computing and entertainment systems. the stock had been trading around $51 in march 2020 at the start of pandemic-related restrictions.

the share price began to retreat as technology stocks sold-off heading into 2022. nvda started the year at $301.21 a share and dropped to $219.44 on 27 january. it rebounded to $267.05 on 9 february and $286.56 on 29 march, but began to fall sharply in april as analysts started to downgrade the stock on signs of slowing consumer demand for gpus and concerns about the impact of high inflation.

technology stocks have borne the brunt of stock market selloffs, as central banks, including the us federal reserve (fed), have begun aggressively raising interest rates and some investors have shifted from stocks to fixed-income assets.

the nvda share price fell to the $161 level in may and despite an uptick to $195.92 in june, continued to decline, reaching $145.23 on 1 july. the stock rose to $192.15 on 4 august, but was unable to hold at that level.

on 24 august, nvidia reported revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended 31 july of $6.7bn, up 3% from the same period in 2021, but down 19% from the previous quarter. earnings per share fell to $0.26, down by 72% from a year earlier and 59% lower than the previous quarter.

jensen huang said:

‚Äúwe are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this.‚Äù

the share price rose from $171.81 on 23 august to $179.13 on 25 august, but at least 14 wall street analysts downgraded their ratings on the stock on 25 august amid expectations of lower projected growth, weighing on the share price as investors sold the stock in response. the share price ended the month at $150.94.

nvda dropped to $139.37 on 1 september in response to an sec filing that the us government had informed the company on 26 august of a new license requirement for exports to china and russia for the company‚Äôs a100 and h100 integrated circuits and any products that incorporate them.

the government indicated that the license is intended to ‚Äúaddress the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a ‚Äòmilitary end use‚Äô or ‚Äòmilitary end user‚Äô in china and russia.‚Äù

nvidia said that it ‚Äúdoes not sell products to customers in russia,‚Äù but ‚Äúthe new license requirement may impact the company's ability to complete its development of h100 in a timely manner or support existing customers of a100 and may require the company to transition certain operations out of china.‚Äù

based on the outlook nvidia provided for its third fiscal quarter in its results on 24 august, approximately $400m in potential sales to china could be subject to the new license requirement, the company said in the filing.

the nvda share price subsequently dropped to $134.65 on 6 september, its lowest level since march 2021. the stock then ticked higher to close at $139.90 on 8 september.

what is the outlook for the nvidia share price after the selloff? can it rebound or will it remain under pressure? let‚Äôs look at some future predictions from analysts.

several wall street analysts downgraded their stock expectations in response to the us government‚Äôs licensing requirements.

analysts at sanford c. bernstein lowered their price target to $180 from $210 on 1 september. on 2 september, daiwa capital markets reduced its target to $133 from $215, downgrading the stock from outperform to neutral, while needham &amp; company lowered its stock projection to $170 from $185.

analysts at deutsche bank declined to provide a forecast until there are more details available, noting:

‚Äúat a time when demand uncertainties are already rising across the semi sector, and rapidly expanding from consumer markets to the data center, we expect these new trade restrictions to add additional investor angst regarding chip demand/growth prospects. we expect the impact on nvda to be largest amongst the us processor companies, given the company‚Äôs leadership position in hpc/ai.‚Äù

when evaluating any nvidia stock 5-year forecast, you should keep in mind that analysts‚Äô forecasts can be wrong. forecasts shouldn‚Äôt be used as a substitute for your own research. always conduct your own due diligence before investing. and never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose.",1,,ThreeSupreme,0

for simplicity, it's nice if you can open most of these at the same place -- for instance, i use schwab for checking, ira, and brokerage.  i don't have a hysa (though they offer one), and 401k is determined by employer, not you.

---

pay off high interest debt asap (e.g. credit cards)

order of money allocation:

1. checking
2. emergency fund (combined with checking balance, 6-12 months expenses)
3. 401k up to the point where you've gotten all available matching funds
4. planned big future spends (vacation, down payment, etc.)
5. ira, up to $6,000 a year
6. 401k, up to $20,500 a year, not including employer match
7. all extra to brokerage

if you're living below your means (and you should be), then your checking account will naturally grow over time.  move any excess money (beyond the 2 months expenses) over to the brokerage account.  that's home base for unallocated funds.

from brokerage, you can throw it at whichever pile should have it, excepting 401k anyway.  push $6,000 a year to roth ira, push money to hysa for future spends, etc.  

if you have any credit cards, set them to auto-pay the balance from your checking, then use them (to generate a long history of on-time payments)

if you don't have any credit cards, open a few and set them up this way.  

if employer matches 401k funds (or 403b), then that's free money and you'd be foolish not to get it.  so do that, and make it a priority.

roth ira, $6,000 a year every year.  unless you're making a lot of money -- then you'd have to look at whether traditional ira is better than roth ira, whether you exceed income limits, etc.  

if you got here, you're doing well.  max out 401k contributions.  this year, that's $20,500 of your contributions (not counting employer contributions)

all extra money goes to brokerage account.

---

investment:

in 401k, there's probably an option for a target date retirement fund.  this is usually a reasonable choice.  it will go from aggressive and risky when you're young to conservative and safe at retirement age.

in ira, it's dealer's choice.  you can do a target date fund just like 401k, or alternatively, throw it in something broad and boring (relative to the stock market -- still a good bit of short term risk) like vti.  vti invests in us markets, weighted by size (so you'll own way more apple stock through it than some random small company, for instance).  vti tends to follow the s&amp;p 500, since the 500 largest us traded companies make up the majority of the stock market.

brokerage is dealer's choice again.  this is unallocated money, so you can do the same as above choices or you can learn all about investing and get more spicy.  there's no training wheels though.

---

figure out what you want to make in retirement.  this is predicated on a bunch of other things like where you want to live, whether you own a home, whether the home is paid off, etc.  
figure out what you *need* to make in retirement to cover all your expenses.  don't forget health insurance.

add up 401k + ira + unallocated money.  when that hits 33x what you need or 25x what you want, whichever is larger, you're probably ready to retire.  congratulations on winning the capitalism game!

---

why hysa is optional:  there's a type of fund called a money fund that invests in really safe, boring things.  they generally make lousy returns (~2% right now i think) but they also almost never lose value.  basically, the price stays $1 per share, and any interest earned is paid out as a dividend.  rather than having a separate hysa, you can choose to have that money in the brokerage account invested in a money fund.  vmfxx is one such fund.  

--- 

you should probably look into hsas (health savings accounts).  i don't know enough about them to offer any advice.

assume the real value (adjusting for inflation) of invested money goes up 5% a year in the long term.  this isn't necessary for anything else, but helps you project into the future while staying in today's dollars and ignoring inflation.

that isn't really what the sec wants to regulate. the sec does not care about 1 eth = 1 eth, they care about 1 eth = x $usd. they want to regulate eth, *the tokens*. 

in that context, eth fails prongs 2 and 3:

&gt;2. in a common enteprise [sic]:

anyone buying eth is exposed to the same success/failure consequences. the market cap of eth is a pooling of all holders of eth. and the obvious promoters of eth are the ethereum foundation, who have been inextricably tied to the eth endeavor since its inception. this represents a failure of prong 2.

&gt;3. an expectation of profit, derived from the efforts of others:

the prong that saves btc (and any commodity).

obviously any given holder of eth is not expecting to make money by working on eth. they are buying into the development of the eth network, be it through upgrades, dapps and other shitcoins that (supposedly) create value on eth, etc

then some kid decided to abuse it and took 10 times more money than he put in. and took a high risk high reward position on apple stock. that of course didn't work out, he also recorded and live stream himself reacting to his bet failing to youtube. robinhood couldn't ignore the glitch anymore so they had to fix it. 

[wiki said that the kid discovered the glitch on his own. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r/wallstreetbets#the_%22infinite_leverage%22_glitch) but wallstreetbets said it was well known before he got involved, i don't know what the truth is.

but yea that is a situation where a company looked the other way. also banks use to look the other way when someone was able to steal money by hacking into their servers. theory at the time was that they would lose more money if their customers knew the banks were being hack. than what the banks lost when hacked. btw tom from myspace was was a black hat hacker who didn't stop until someone arrested him.",20,,NomadFire,0

1663851414,"i'd actually say the lawyering that we saw in this episode has been the best in the series.     
i wouldn't say that mallory committed malpractice, in fact the deal she got was likely pretty good for him all things considered.  we do not know the immortal's exact income, but it is pretty safe to assume he is well off.  i mean, he has hundreds of years of accumulated wealth as indicated by him mentioning his gold that he acquired from a very old marriage.  it's likely he's been doing this and making money off it for centuries.  california, the state they are in, is a community property state.  this means that any property that is brought into the marriage is property of both spouses equally and upon divorce, that property is split equally between the spouses.  by going to trial, it is likely that the court would require him to split all his property (wealth) 8 ways for each of his wives.  plus, child support for the one he was with.  while to us, it might sound like he got screwed by mallory because apple stock and gold is worth a ton, the fact he likely has centuries of accumulated wealth somewhat indicate that by only losing those he was still able to keep the majority of his centuries of accumulated wealth.  trials are expensive and extremely time consuming, so typically lawyers try to settle cases and this actually felt like a good example of a settlement.

however, things that were still bad lawyering:  mallory should not have let nikki take charge of the settlement terms.  this felt more like giving nikki something to be useful in the episode.  but you can't have your paralegal dictate the terms of the settlement, she is not barred in ca and has no authority to represent someone.",2,,jklages24,0

we are not sure if the $28m donation was from their own pockets or if it was a corporate donation. that would qualify as a write-off to their personal returns or the company's tax returns. if it was a personal donation though, then it would mean they're in a position where 28m is not a huge amount of money for them to donate. plus, it was clearly a pr move because their company might have suffered ever since walt was exposed.  
  
not sure how much of a stake they have in their company but i am guessing they do not own 100%.  
  
going with public companies:  
zuck owns 13% of meta  
musk owns 17% of tesla  
buffet owns 38% of berkshire  
page &amp; brin own 12% of google stock, unsure how much of alphabet stock they own.  
  
these are just conservative estimates because the companies have a very high market cap (almost near the trillion dollar mark). some smaller companies (9-10 figure valuations), have their owners owning as low as 5% or owning as much as 50%+.  
  
hence we'll go with an estimate they own 25% of the company, that brings it down to $500m in shares. adding their personal net worths, we would probably reach a figure around 1b for both of them.

however you're forgetting that gus was in the meth business for 20 years now (going from the date of max's death to the date of gus' death). walt as an amateur drug kingpin made $80m within a period of 3 months, so we'll assume that gus cleared a higher amount like $100m+ every quarter. that brings him to $400m annually and he's been in the business for 20 years (of course sales weren't constant).

in any case, gus is worth a few billion easily. i think the estimate would be between 1-2b and i think it might surpass the wealth of the schwartz's",1,,maxpayne3zz1,0

which is great for current owners, until the party stops.  like, for example, you run out of people who can afford to pay insanely high prices. or you have a rental crisis where a recession means renters can no longer subsidize lots of owners, who then have to sell.

1663870146,"so get your downvotes ready, but i can make a case for the space race one.

&amp;#x200b;

you know how we got cool stuff like velcro and memory foam and dozens of other neat technologies out of nasa programs? doing stuff in space does help us out; even poor people often get some benefit from technological discovers and developments. but also, you know what most rich people do with most of their money? they invest it in ways that make them more money. these don't usually include things that directly create jobs all that much. example: if i have a million dollars would i buy 1000 macbooks or buy 6600 shares of apple stock? stock, obviously, but when i make that purchase i haven't really increased gdp in a meaningful way. once i invest my money with apple, they may use it to do some research or production or they may just throw it on top of the enormous pile of money they already have. even if they do decide to do some research, that's only a handful of jobs for for a handful of years. but it's not like i could use more than 2 or 3 macbooks at a time, let alone 1000. 

once you hit a certain level of wealth it becomes hard to spend your money on tangible things. you can buy private jets. you can buy mega-yachts. you may not prefer that ultra-wealth people buy things like this, but the whole idea behind ""trickle-down economics"" (and the reason it doesn't actually work in practice) is that it depends on rich people **spending** (not investing) their money on stuff. when the money is **spent** gdp may be increased. something has been produced and someone was payed to produce it. they, in turn, get to spend the money i gave them on things like rent, food, entertainment, yada yada and so on -- you know, economics. if i'm super rich i can buy a private jet or a yacht and the boat wrights or boeing or lockheed or whoever will get paid, and i'll have to keep paying some amount for maintenance and upkeep. i'll have created, or at least maintained, some number of jobs. but we haven't really learned anything from it. boats and jets don't have to have the most up to date tech to be able to float and fly.  and just like laptops, i can only use so many. it doesn't make much sense to have more than one private jet, following me or transporting me directly. i could theoretically have a fleet of yachts, but no one would have more than a couple in real life. 

on the other hand, going to space is complicated and expensive. if i buy 50 million dollars worth of space travel i'm buying some real material. rockets need to be designed and built. being cutting edge tech means that designs are always being refined, production techniques are being changed and new research is being done. it takes a lot of people to send anything to space, let alone if that thing is a person. rocket fuel needs to be produced. metals need to be mined and refined. i suppose that could be viewed as wasteful from a certain point of view, but part of making space travel a commodity is that it becomes more efficient. we used to just lose literal tons of metal with every rocket launch, but now spacex has rocket stages that can land themselves and be reused. and the more money gets spent on these things, the more efficient they become. another important point is that once i've spent 50 million dollars on space travel, i don't have a reason not to do it again. and my massive wallet opens up massively each time i do. that's a gdp increase.

i realize that it's turning space science into kind of a class-based thing. if you're saying it should be more democratized then i completely agree. i would love for nasa to have way more funding and do way more cool things. new telescopes are awesome, but we've barely been to the moon at all let alone recently. there's so much science to do! of course i'd prefer that these were public projects, but since that isn't happening very quickly i'm  more than happy to drain ultra-wealth wallets getting it done.  

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr: i'm just a space nerd that wants us to go to space develop cool new rockets. having rich people pay for rocket rides is a fantastic way to pay for rocket science and drain ultra-wealthy wallets at the same time.",11,,malik753,0

1663913167,"consolidations are tricky because if you get in early (pre-empt), you have to be willing to get back in after any fakeout/shakeout. also, it can continue going sideways without ever making a move.

the textbook way to play a rectangle base is to get in as the top or bottom is being taken out. like 0.01 above or below, respectively. the drawback is that you're gonna have a wider stop, especially if the base isn't super tight and clean.

what you will find with experience, however, is that most bases aren't perfect boxes. they are often staggered rectangles within rectangles as the 'losing side' gives up more and more ground before the breakout/breakdown.

other times, there can be a triangle within the base that narrows to a point. it will do one final pullback before breaking. often the rejection will occur at or near the sloping 20/21 ema/sma.

[take a look at $amd today](https://i.imgur.com/tspvpfc.png) since it was a much cleaner example than $nvda. i marked off the larger rectangle, the smaller rectangle, and the descending trendline.

**entry 1** at the descending trendline is really early (aggressive) and you can use either the tweezers, the smaller rectangle, or the larger rectangle as a stop.

**entry 2** is better since you are below the declining 20 and can use the wick from entry 1 as your stop.

**entry 3** is the classic breakdown you see in textbooks. more volume comes in at this point because it is the traditional way to trade this pattern.

sometimes after the initial flush, there's a pullback to the bottom of the base (breakdown point), which is a good secondary entry. it didn't happen today so obviously not depicted.

i know it can be frustrating at times, but there are a lot of nuances despite being such a simple pattern. i recommend going down one timeframe to study price action during the consolidation, right before the move, and as the break is happening. eventually you will develop the intuition on which entry you are best at spotting/trading.

1663942098,"this is entirely bs.

nvidia made a miscalculation.... only someone with a unique balance of tech and finance would catch it though.  
nvidia is increasing margins to bring in shareholders because of the massive stock of amphere and ada gpus made. they sacrifice their mindshare and loyalists to keep stock price high.  
problem is, the federal reserve will keep rates high until something in the market breaks.... so nvidia stock will crash regardless.  
now they have a ton of product they have to sell, losing mindshare, and stock price will inevitably fall due to macro economic conditions.  
if gamers can hold off for 12 motnhs and not buy, that would force nvidia to shave their margins in half, stuck between the fed crushing them and gamers that wont buy their high margins.

1663955050,"it doesn't matter,  bitcoin is still based on flawed logic.

step 1) spend $100 on electricity to get 1 bitcoin (owner a)

2) you sell that coin for $112; 12% profit. (owner a)

3) bitcoin now worth 112; new owner is now negative -112 (owner b)

4) owner b mines a new coin, but it costs $108 in electricity now as the coins are getting harder to mine.

5) owner b sells his 2 coins -$112 + -$108 for $246.4 making a 12% profit again.

now owner c has 2 coins worth $123.2 each for a market cap of $246.4

&amp;#x200b;

the flaw is, it's artificial, it's just accounting shenanigans, as the money spent is on electricity is lost, but not included in the market cap.  this lost is made up for by the individual investors.

the real world value of that coin would be if everyone settled, $246.4 (-$112 + -$108) = 26.4

&amp;#x200b;

the price is grossly over inflated and it has to be and it can only get worse as long as the scheme keeps running, due to the ever increasing costs to mine them,  the mining costs must be absorbed.

and when the price of eggs goes up to $4 a dozen, well you don't have to buy the eggs.   but if you need the eggs, you will have to pay all four dollars to get them. 

and if the price of housing goes up to insane and unaffordable rates, well, you don't have to buy a house.   you'll have to keep renting that apartment and writing your landlord checks every month. 

and when the price of your apartment goes up by 30 percent for no real reason, well, what can you do.  maybe move in with your grandparents, or with some friends you met back in college. 

and when the price of aapl stock falls from 180 to 150, well maybe it wasn't really worth 180 in the first place.  maybe when that august 2020 4-1 stock split happened and the price leapt from 85 to 110 overnight, it became a game for speculators (like bitcoin) instead of a true value.  a share of stock isn't worth anything, not really.

let's say you're offered a pay rise of ¬£5000 which you can take as cash or as stock options - you could take that money as cash and invest the cash in apple stock; hardly anyone would so that because investing has risk, whereas money paid off your debt is a certain return (probably at a higher rate too!).

the only time i'd ever go long intraday when the daily is in a downtrend is if we are extended and pulling back towards the ma's on a very strong daily candle. there has to be lots of room to the next resistance area. something like the [sep 12 candle on $aapl](https://i.imgur.com/iyyamxm.png). had a nice gap-up so it was in in play.

the key is using the hourly/daily charts to find levels where price will react. even when the hourly is in an uptrend, you don't need to look very far back to find meaningful resistance when the daily is in a downtrend. i always prefer a clear path to my target.

1664203190,"delta calls are skewed towards high beta stocks.  bulls keep buying the dip. (i am quoting)

if a stock goes up a buck, the delta is the correlation between that price increase and the option price.  options are cheaper than stocks so it's not 1 to 1 but gets closer to 1 to 1 if it gets closer to the strike price.

beta is a measure of a stock's volatility.  delta calls in this case are playing off bulls continually buying the dip because they are relentlessly doing so.  

spx is therefore reacting negatively to having any company but apple in its index.

tl;dr: all of the s&amp;p that isn't apple is more volatile because apple bulls are relentless.  other portions of the s&amp;p are capitulating at a rate higher than apple.

my guess: foreign money is relentlessly buying apple dips.  the federal reserve doesn't want this and apple is extraordinarily expensive in non-us currency.  apple is turning into a foreign treasury fund.  eventually american fund capitulation will show up when foreign money dries up.  this will further slaughter foreign currencies.  europe's piper will be paid in losses unless they meaningfully act as the emerging market the european union has basically turned into.  manufacturing is rushing out of europe for basically anywhere.  furloughs are going to happen.  this shrinks the tax base.

it's crazy what this means apple stock has become.  if brk capitulates watch the fuck out.  because they very well could and start buying europe or england.  and i say this based off buffet's famous be greedy when others are fearful.",1,,Walternotwalter,0

1664231019,"tldr; 6 months of experience, 0 wlb, terrible practices, no learning, constant crunch, feeling burned out, some complaining, i feel like i've been thrown into senior position as an intern

i warn you in advance that below are 4 hours of me complaining and losing my mental health because i've realized in how shitty position i am. so don't expect book quality, since english is not my primary language, and also very long wall of text.

* what do i even do with myself? i can't really look for a job, because 6 months of experience is very low; also i think that switching job after first 6 months in industry is terrible idea. i could maybe do few projects, but i don't have energy or time to do it. worst part is that 99% positions require 2 or even 5 commercial yoe. and even if by some miracle i get a job i'd have to move and live on my own away from everyone i know.
* how do i find time for learning? i'm working 9-5, but when i come back home i'm completely lifeless to anything thinking related.
* how to avoid burnout? from feeling happy about working in first few weeks i came to the moment where i am constantly tired and disgusted by my code.
* is developing php/laravel mostly crud hell, or did i get into a terrible company?

some background:

i've been working at current company for 6 months. my official position is php/laravel backend developer, but i often do frontend as well(aka recreating, sometimes even coming up with designs..).

some info about company: +-15 people doing wordpress stuff, 3 designers + some people in management; some laravel projects before me, mostly written by 3 juniors and senior, only two are still around, one is junior that got transferred from wordpress devs. another one is cocky ""senior"" wordpress/laravel dev that writes worse spaghetti than me and does more ""laravel flavored php5 + wordpress"" than laravel.

as you will see later, in next paragraphs i mostly use 'i' to refer to our team; why you might ask? because said junior and senior spend most time with developing wordpress; they only help me when i do not handle/i'm not at work.

for the past 4 months or so i'm living in constant crunch - i worked on only 4 projects(none of them are finished, i joined when they were allegedly being only polished), but deadlines are 2 or even more times too short. it would've been all good, but time it takes to do simple things like filtering takes exponentially more time because of shitty decisions in db/app design. also, the fact, that mostly there is no explanation on what things should do, and even if there is if you look at it closely you can see errors and stupid things that have no right to work(e.g. last day of doing a ""sprint"", and client have noticed that there is no crud of element described only the table, and he approved that before, on saturday i got a call ""yeah, soooo... it'd be nice if you could come to work today, because some important thing got missed, and client said we need to deliver that"")

i believe, that i should also learn from work, not only write cruds over and over; but with current deadlines i don't even have time to think about the best way to do anything; when i come onto any idea i just do it, because if i leave more time to thinking i'd have to work overtime or feel anxious that i under-delivered. my code quality is improving, but i feel like i only learn bad practices when i can't think about the right way to do things.

and well, if i am complaining i'll give you few funny things about my work experience.

* i haven't touched eloquent since joining.

* one deadline was 1 day(monday morning to tuesday morning). i delivered said thing on tuesday, but the one in next week.

* big chunk of frontend js/frontend logic is written by me(backend dev btw.)

* most functions delivered by senior(filtering, searching; tbh all functions that need to work fast and well) are rewritten by me; either because by default they were too slow(90s to search products in 10k product database) or didn't work at all(e.g. filtering only worked on few fields, and only one filter could work at once; searching only worked on 'name' fields, where it was occurring only in one table)

* one of functions(pretty simple, changing status based on info from few places) has 5 instances that differ only by minor things; it could easily be shrunk to one few-lines long function, but guess what: i have no time

* you think n+1 problem is bad? all of our main pages with tables were doing around 2000-3000 queries each load(mostly tables info, filtering data); loading one entry in table on my localhost took 2s, on server it was 0.5s, still terrible.
that has to be big ass table with many users, right? info for one user takes 120 rows; so at this time with 700 users we have more than 80k useless rows that complicate every single thing.

* when i came here there were 0 uses of route() function; every url was(and big chunk of them is still) hardcoded, oh what a fun it was to rename few hundreds hrefs because client didn't like url naming.

* 0 use of components; imagine changing style of input on +-60 views(i've gone through that)

* one pretty evening client decided that he wants advanced permissions (per button, site, input, action etc.) on the app. at that moment application was around 150 views, maybe more; deadline for that was 2 days. i believe i made around 700 permissions that 2 days. client still complained about wrong permissions(mind you, that he said that he will choose permissions himself)

* another pretty morning my task was to translate rest of the app. there was only 50 translations at that time, not even placed in the app. deadline? morning next day. after 3 days it was 2000 translated sentences + 7000 translations usages.

* my project manager is using one hell of a good drug along with senior and clients; i don't think they managed to make one realistic deadline or thoroughly thoughtful and designed feature that does not require my guessing on how it should work.

* talking project manager/clients - in all 4 projects that i've been part of there has been 0 testers. usually ""tests"" are done by client, and most of the time few hours before deployment of update. add that to terrible projects communication, and you have walls of bugs/things not working how they should that need to be fixed asap.

* pseudo of pinnacle of our senior dev; function to create options for country selection.
&gt; foreach(getcountries() as $k =&gt; $v)
&gt;
&gt; echo ""&lt;option"".getcountrybyid($k) == $k ? selected : ''.""&gt;"".getcountrybyid($k).""&lt;/option&gt;""
&gt;
i believe this function alone made around 400 queries every time it was used. it was his way of handling that getcountries() returns untranslated strings.

* 0 naming conventions; naming consists of camel, kebab, lc only, snake and whatever cases you can name. how would you name function to get element from db(in said resource controller)? guess yourself:
    * get()
    * getbyid()
    * getelementbyid()
    * getelementbyidsingle()
    * get_by_id()
    * get_element_by_id_single()
    * element()

or maybe, it will be different in each controller? all of those names were used at least once.

and cherry on top - there is ongoing debate about moving all 4 unfinished projects to wordpress. i'm not even sure who came up with that stupidly awful idea, every dev disagrees with that, but management is delighted by that idea. and i don't know if i will be fired or transferred to wordpress. main reasoning is 'laravel apps take too much time to create and ability to adapt new devs is very bad(guess why)'

i'll end the complaining here - i'll also admit, that i also did some of these things(i was hired as an intern with 0 laravel knowledge; also basically 0 feedback/help from senior), so it's partly my fault and i take full responsibility for it and keep working with this abnormally bad codebase.

and to those who survived - i'm raising glass of milk for y'all. thanks for coming to my ted talk.",0,,Perfect_Advice9977,0

1664241551,"i'd always said i'd buy microsoft stock when it went public.  a few years before they did, an old delinquent account finally paid their personal debt to me ($28,000).  my company was doing so well that i didn't need the money, but instead of saving it for the microsoft public offering, i just dumped it in the corporate bank account.  i still had most of it when ms did go public, but by then i was angry with ms and bill gates and didn't buy a share.

if i'd parked the money in savings i'd have had to pay taxes on it.  but two years of interest would have made some of that back.  i'd have gotten out when we needed the money -- coincidentally, when ms was near their local maximum in late 1999  (they recovered and went even higher six years later, but that wouldn't have mattered).  after taxes, i'd probably have had somewhere around ten million dollars.  yeah, that would have made a difference.

the stock is also the largests s and p 500 component by a large amount (historically) at this point, it is hard for me to believe that this is sustainable, at least in the short to medium term. the p/e is still high and i would expect that it has to give in some way. earnings will likely not be stellar, but probably not awful either. the stock price must come down in the short term before this market bottoms. at that point it may seem more attractive.

&gt;  
&gt;yes, they can cash out a few billion without having huge effects on the company, but it has to be predetermined cash outs that are generally approved by a board of directors so that it doesn‚Äôt hurt the value of the company.

this is true; it's not like zuckerberg has immediate access to the billions in equity value he owns in meta. but people who become this wealthy ""on paper"" don't really count on being able to access that value directly. what they do is use that equity value as collateral or leverage to obtain access to other capital that they use to make purchases and live on. if zuck buys a new mansion, the funds for that purchase likely aren't coming from a sale of his meta stock; he's getting a loan from somewhere and getting extremely favorable terms on that loan (to the point that his borrowing is practically free) by putting up his stock value as collateral. having huge ""paper"" wealth provides indirect access to tons of funding and liquidity options that ""normal"" people can't even dream of accessing. zuck's ""wealth"" is largely tied up in meta and can't be directly accessed, but he's not cash poor or hurting for liquid capital.",30,,UltraVires33,0

- decentralization, eliminating single points of failure for digital ecosystems.

- ability for creators to own the content they produce.

web3 cons:
- current lack of web3 infrastructure
- no true web3 communities exist (yet), meaning there isnt an incentive for creators to move from web2.

you'll hear a lot about web3 in the coming 2-3 years. it's the next wave in crypto, and honestly the only wave that will bring legitimate value to the crypto space. why else would companies like $meta be repositioning to capitalize on a digital economy?

i'll also add, if you're doing dd on reddit you're going to see nothing but the worst crypto has to offer, since redditors are notorious for supporting dead-end projects that are destined to fail (ada, eth, avax, hbar, ftm, safemoon, shib, doge, etc.). to understand crypto you really do need to dyor, not by watching a youtuber with 10m followers, but by reading whitepapers and actually developing on the networks you want to invest in. development drives innovation in crypto. the ecosystems that enable developers, not consumers, are worth looking into, everything else is a ponzi scheme.",-2,,ChodChoddington,0

the stuff you are saying about how it works is just patently untrue. 

you can say ""play i see you at the movies"" and get chinese new year by sales every single time. it's not contextually as dumb as you say, it's just completely lazy technology made with a very blatant disregard for users and i came asking singularly for a flag to turn off for near matches and stations entirely.

i just want to point out google's quantum computing claims are dubious at best.  still a strong company for other reasons but there's a lot of reason to believe their initial claim was a marketing gimmick.  they claimed they did some calculations in a few minutes that would take the world's most powerful super computer 10,000 years or something then a small team of chinese researchers did the same computations in a few hours with some new algorithm and not even using a supercomputer.  on top of that the problem they chose for the test was intentionally designed to be as hard as possible for a traditional computer yet easy as possible for a quantum computer.  some other researchers came out and said if the chinese team used a supercomputer they probably would have beat google's quantum machine solve time.   we are still at the point a useable quantum computer costs tens of billions of dollars to build and it will likely be quite a while before that becomes a money making venture.",7,,Extreme_Fee_503,0

1664344605,"opposite for me. i began with stocks and branched out to crypto in 2017. mostly swing and positional trading for the latter (love the 24/7 and no gaps).

if you understand price action in one instrument, it translates well to most others. here's my two cents regarding your questions from above.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;basic starter info/exchanges

us markets are open from 9:30 am to 4 pm eastern time. there's also a few hours of pre-market and after-hours trading (less volume and higher spreads).

$spy is the s&amp;p 500 index and is equivalent to $btc: most stocks follow it throughout the trading day. exceptions are earnings or independent catalysts where a stock is 'in-play' and does its own thing. similar to an alt coin with fresh news.

exchanges are not relevant for stocks/options since they are centralized (nasdaq, nyse, amex, cme, etc.). just choose a broker+platform. depending on where you are located, the [pattern day trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/pdtrules/) (pdt) rule might apply.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;can i expect less volatility with stocks?

in general, yes. however, there are individual stocks that move much more than crypto (few hundred percent per day). these are typically low-floats and/or penny stocks‚Äîthe shitcoins of the stock market. i would recommend staying away from those as it's difficult to manage risk properly. that being said, you can still find some high r2r trades with med/large cap stocks. $tsla is an example of a high volatility mega cap.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;do setups play out better with stocks? are patterns any more reliable?

again, this depends on which patterns/setups you trade. are you a scalper or trend trader? the classics‚Äîbreakouts, triangles, pullbacks, etc. are pretty universal across instruments. on the 1, 2, and 5-minute charts, bitcoin tends to be more unpredictable compared to something like $aapl or $nvda. i'd say that stocks respect technicals much better than crypto on the lower timeframes.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;should i even bother adding stocks to my arsenal?

depends what your goals are. most traders tend to stay within their niche and comfort zones. if you're already profitable, you can simply increase size and stick to what you know.

if you want to learn something new, then it doesn't hurt to try. start watching stocks and see if the charts look familiar to you. you can even paper-trade first if you want to dip your toe in. cheers and best of luck :)",9,,Cranky_Crypto,0

1664349959,"i'll elaborate for u/thegreaterguy. see here's the difference. stock in nvidia is based on nvidia's performance. like if they can produce quality graphic cards that people want to buy. there is nothing analogous to bitcoin. nothing. so its a fiat currency. its not tied to anything. its based on market demand which is highly speculative, with a restricted supply, so lots of volatility, and nothing you can do about it. but ultimately, what can you do with bitcoin? what utility does it have to base its value on. i can only really think of two things. a libertarian's wet dream, which only works if you buy into the ideology, and transferring money to dissidents in authoritarian regimes. at least with nvidia stock you get some voice via voting.",1,,ilikedota5,0

&gt;cupertino (dpa-afx) - infolge einer fehlenden nachfrage will apple kreisen zufolge die produktion seiner neuen iphone-reihe nun doch nicht erh√∂hen. der im kalifornischen cupertino ans√§ssige technikgigant habe seinen zulieferern mitgeteilt, die produktionsgeschwindigkeit im zweiten halbjahr nicht mehr um bis zu sechs millionen einheiten zu steigern, berichtete die nachrichtenagentur bloomberg in der nacht zu mittwoch unter berufung auf mit der angelegenheit vertraute personen. apple lehnte eine stellungnahme ab.  
&gt;  
&gt;stattdessen plane der konzern mit 90 millionen exemplaren der produktlinie rund um das iphone 14 und damit so viele wie im vorjahreszeitraum, hie√ü es im bericht. damit w√ºrde apple zu seiner urspr√ºnglichen prognose aus diesem sommer zur√ºckkehren. zwischenzeitlich hatte das unternehmen die verkaufsprognose angehoben. das iphone gilt als mit abstand wichtigstes produkt des konzerns und macht einen gro√üteil des gesch√§ftes aus. das weihnachtsquartal mit frischen iphone-modellen ist traditionell das st√§rkste im jahr f√ºr apple.  
&gt;  
&gt;aktuell sollen sich kunden st√§rker f√ºr das h√∂herpreisige iphone 14 pro interessieren. in mindestens einem fall habe ein zulieferer aus diesem grund die produktionskapazit√§ten von den g√ºnstigeren einstiegsmodellen auf das premium-ger√§t umgestellt. in diesem jahr stellte das unternehmen vier modelle aus der reihe vor: das iphone 14, das etwas gr√∂√üere iphone 14 plus sowie die beiden premium-modelle iphone 14 pro sowie iphone 14 max. das kompaktere mini-modell, das apple noch bei seinen produktlinien 12 und 13 angeboten hatte, war infolge fehlender nachfrage eingestellt worden.",2,,thereallymadcow,0

1664357119,"i wish my parents had done something along those lines for me. instead they forced me to put half of whatever i earned into a ""college fund"" where they told me that it would earn interest and grow (no allowance ever, i would go mow lawns, rototill gardens, rake leaves, shovel snow, etc). unfortunately they knew nothing about investing, and so my interest totalled about $0.03/year for every $1,000 i had in the account, and i was also being charged a monthly fee for being below the minimum balance. when i discovered this at age 11 i was appauled and did lots of research on how to better invest my money, quickly deciding on the stock market. (december 2008, the stock market was at the lowest point since the great depression, perfect time to buy) i decided that apple inc was the company i wanted to invest in (can you see where this is going...). at the time i had just over $1500 in the account, and apple stock was $2.60 a share. i could buy 577 shares. today that is worth $2,451,834.56 (7 way split in 2014, 4 way split in 2020). unfortunately, i didn't get to see any of this actually happen because my parents vetoed my decision, saying that the stock market wasn't always a good investment, that i was too young to understand the nuances of investing responsibly, and that the stock market was in the process of crashing. instead they just added about $500 to the account so that it wouldn't get charged the peasant fee. so here i am 14 years later at age 25, broke as shit and living in the suburbs of one of the most expensive cities in the country in my mom's house (which is valued at just under $800,000 despite the fact that the siding needs replacing, the windows were improperly installed, the previous owner was the worst carpenter i've ever seen and still built himself 3 extensions on to the place, which are now falling apart, and the yard is a sea of thistles and blackberry vines that don't even produce any berries. fixed up and landscaped it would easily sell for $1,000,000+). to add insult to injury, i hated school and love to build things, so once i finished high school i became an independent contractor. when i withdrew all of the money from the college account in order to help pay for tools, i had to pay a 10% penalty + oregon income tax of about 9% due to using the money for ""non education purposes"". i hate my life.",1,,_TheNecromancer13,0
1664357922,"to be frank i was expecting apple to fall at some point as, from the point of view of the european consumer (but you can apply this to all world countries with high inflation):

\- personal earning around the same as last year

\- currency (eur) is 20% weaker. import prices are dollar denominated, meaning everything is 20% more expensive now

\- from the personal earnings, energy slice is 3-6 times higher, transportation almost doubled, food around 25% more expensive

\- reference apple prices are in usd without sales tax, vat is \~ 20% in europe

so, you might see apple being hit from two angles:

\- sales (units and revenue) slowing down, as people can afford to delay upgrading their iphone for a year or two, or purchase the se or mini versions which are cheaper

\- forex impact or, if they hike prices, lower sales.

it was a surprise for me that they were increasing orders.

on a funny note, in my country, i find that delivery times for the new apple products are 0 day for the ones launched, stock is plentiful. so yeah, it is time apple stock price shits the bed. also, checked in the spring the delivery time for a tesla model 3, was around spring 2023. checked again, depending on version, it starts with november 2022.

after introduction of capitalism and end of slavery in 1861 people were starting to get greedy and worrying only about profits, not life endurance. most of people, however, became even more like a slaves due to actions of greed-minded usurers, who forced people in loan cabala. they were destroying the farming communities of peasants called ‚Äúmira‚Äù (‚Äúworld‚Äù, ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in old russian), and they became called ‚Äúmiraeds‚Äù / ‚Äúmira‚Äù-devourers, or more commonly known word for them was ‚Äúkulaks‚Äù, originating from russian word ‚Äúfist‚Äù, as in ‚Äúholding someone in iron fist‚Äù. in 1860-1880 overall peasantry land fallen for 30%: from 4.6 to 3.5 ‚Äúdesyatin‚Äù (old russian unit of measurement of area of 10x10 yards). if in 1880-1890 amount of regions affected by famine was 18 at maximum, in 1890-1900 it was 29 at maximum; in 1901-1910 it was 49 in 1911-1912 it was 60

since the beginning of the 20th century, the hungry years have gone one after another.  ‚Äúin the winter of 1900-1901, 42 million people were starving, and 2,813,000 orthodox souls died as a result of this famine.‚Äù  the years of famine were 1902 and 1903, which escalated into popular riots.  in 1902-1903, 200,000 regular troops, that is, 1/5 of the entire russian army of those years, were used to suppress peasant uprisings and protests of workers in the poltava and kharkov provinces alone, and this is not counting hundreds of thousands of gendarmes, cossacks and policemen. at the beginning of the 20th century, not only bad weather prevented the ripening of bread, but also popular riots, which turned into a revolution of 1905-1907, also act as reasons.  the famine of 1905 struck 22 provinces, including four non-chernozem provinces ‚Äî pskov, novgorod, vitebsk, kostroma.  famine was observed in 1906, 1907 and 1908.  ""the consumption of food grains (except for oats) per capita on average in 1901-1904 was equal to 16.36 pounds, in the next four-year famine of 1905-1908 it dropped to 13.69 pounds on average or decreased by 16%, in the most lean year - 1906/07 - up to 12.57 pounds or 23%.  this famine was accompanied by a sharp increase in morbidity.  the number of cases of scurvy alone from 1905 to 1907 increased by 528%.  case, in particular epidemics of measles and scarlet fever among children.  in 1911 (already after the vaunted stolypin reforms): ‚Äú32 million starved, 1 million 613 thousand people died from this famine‚Äù (in total, more than 8 million people died from hunger from 1900 to 1912).  but even when there was no big famine in russia, this does not mean that people ate their fill, it only means that they did not starve.  moreover, even in such years, individual counties were starving.  even in the ""normal"" years, the situation was difficult.  this is evidenced by the very low level of the officially established ""physiological minimum"" - 14 pounds of bread per year, and bread was the main food of the inhabitants of the pre-revolutionary village.  in 1907, prince d.n. svyatopolk-mirsky stated in the state duma that 212 kg of bread were consumed per capita in russia, while in england - 299 kg, in france - 363 kg, in germany - 317 kg.

a $699 graphics card (like the 1080ti) in 2016 before covid and mining craziness would cost significantly more today just based simply on inflation, 23.4% since..(per [https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) ), makes that $699 pricepoint card in 2016 worth $862.57 today just based on inflation/devaluation of the dollar....

i'd love to see $500 top tier cards as much as anyone else, but reality makes me think that's pretty unlikely even if the supply chain glut of nvidia stock is as bad as rumored.  i do think something like the 3080 (10gb black friday sales!) will tickle that price if they push the awful 3070 series into the $400-500 range where it should be and bring the 3060ti closer to $350 or less where it should be.  i think nvidia would do well if they did follow the amd trend and pushed a 20-30% cut across the board on their msrp's soon to start moving inventory which i expect may be something they announce around the time amd makes their new card announcement.",16,,MN_Moody,0

all this feels a bit like apple's ""california bubble"" in action once again where most of their stuff works very well as long as you are using it in california. here in finland apple maps is crap compared to google maps, swiftkey works far better than apple keyboard and so on.",2,,kasakka1,0

besides, on the subject of houses (not apartments), many people like me could afford to buy if others weren't buying up all the supply as investments. when there's more demand than supply, like here and now, how is it not zero-sum? not everyone who wants a house will ever get one, but we can do a lot better by not letting individuals hoard many at a time for profit.

public housing is not banned in this country. no one prevents you from going and advocating for it. neither are coops. you are free to join a few like minded individuals to form a company and try and build housing for yourself and others, non profit.

ultimately, however, historically, in this country, projects like these - pun intended - always failed. why? because government officials that you vote into office are incompetent as leaders, and cannot manage projects effectively.  what is your basis for voting for a politician? it's how much they support equity and social justice and lgbtq+ and antiracism and shit like this. it is now how they can write contracts, or cost projects, or hire people who can. as a result everything the government touches tends to cost 10 times as much. you don't know this because for you - someone else - not you -  is paying taxes, and roads and sidewalks and schools just appear.  but when i pour concrete on my farm, same shape, same amount, cubic yard by cubic yard, it is literally 5 times less expensive than when city of seattle doing that. that's why any sizeable project run by government ultimately fails. you've been promised affordable housing, and the government spent hundreds of millions on that. you've been promised solution for homelessness, and the government spent billions on that. now you are promised ""social housing"", and that project is unfunded. if you think government will succeed this time, we'll, there is a bridge in brooklyn i am happy to offer you really cheap...

&gt; many people like me could afford to buy if others weren't buying up all the supply as investments

no. you couldn't. if somehow your dream were to come to pass, people like me would buy all the housing stock that would be dumped on the market at prices you still couldn't afford - just to increase our living space. i would totally have a floor of a former apartment building downtown to use as a tennis court.

&gt; nobody needs microsoft stock to survive

you keep missing the point, so i will repeat it one last time. for things to happen, someone needs to put up the money. for me to put up the money, i need to be shown profit. this profit needs to be oversized because every investment is a risk, and this profit needs to also cover for possibility of this investment failing.",1,,verylittlefinger,0

1. nvidia stays the same at $122 - your profit and loss is the same for holding the stock vs buying the option
2. nvidia rises to 128$ - roughly 4.8k profit in both cases
3. nvidia rises above 128$ - your max profit is unlimited for the stock but capped at 4.8k for the option
4. nvidia drops to 117$ - roughly 4.8k loss in both scenarios
5. nvidia drops below 117$ - your max loss can be up to your entire investment for the stock but only -4.8k for the option

shame on you.

edit: leaving aside that, you‚Äôre just wrong about everything. 

doing something you know might result in your death isn‚Äôt suicide if you don‚Äôt intend to kill yourself. a soldier who jumps on a grenade doesn‚Äôt commit suicide. a parent who places themself between a bear and their child doesn‚Äôt commit suicide. in this hypothetical, the act the priest intends is laying in bed. his motive is maintaining the seal. if he died, his death would not be suicide. look up the principle of double effect. 

and yes, refraining from an act you would have otherwise done based on new knowledge is changing your behavior. for example, imagine you had resolved to sell all your apple stock tomorrow. at dinner tonight, your brother who works in a senior role at apple tells you ‚Äúi‚Äôm not supposed to tell anyone this because it‚Äôs highly confidential and i signed an nda, but in three days we‚Äôre announcing ar glasses that will be a bigger deal than the iphone.‚Äù you sit down at your computer that night as planned, but decide not to go to e*trade and put in the sale order. that‚Äôs changing your behavior. it‚Äôs also insider trading. the fact that you *refrained* from doing something, rather than affirmatively doing something, doesn‚Äôt change that.

edit 2: imagine this. a cop‚Äôs beat has him driving past a crisis pregnancy center every night. he learns from his daughter that jane‚Äôs revenge is going to burn it down that night, right about the time he normally drives by. he decides to change his routine and get some donuts that night so as not to be in a position to catch them in the act, and is sitting in the donut shop when the arson happens. is *that* not changing behavior based on information learned?  would you say that that cop hadn‚Äôt made use of what he learned from his daughter. if he were threatened with reprimand, would you stand up and say ‚Äúhe did not facilitate the arson, he just changed his routine‚Äù? 

using the information learned in confession is forbidden for good or for ill. the prohibition on use is not limited to disclosure.",5,,CascadianExpat,0

when that fell through, he next impulse was to shill dogecoin (his other big overpriced asset). 

it‚Äôs clear musk never saw twitter as an undervalued company to turn around. he never cared about it‚Äôs actual success. he wanted it so he could say whatever he desired without avail and pervert it to help his other investments.
