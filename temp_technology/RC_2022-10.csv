i am yolo this baby, i am from a non euro/usd dollar, so my salary is not so high due to my bills and etc, but i am holding almost xxk shares and i have planned to add every paycheck a bit on my position averaging up slowly (my average is 1.03 as i averaged up already twice).

i had 1 big hit when i started trading and i made 15x with $bngo xd so i dont know how as more as i dd avaya and apart of working with their product, i have to say that i am confident af.

some will not have stomach to handle the swings, market volatility and all the people that also try to counter argument our positive dd with negative stuff and wrong information.

of course there is the risk, and some still call us meme, but trust me dog (like if yuo should lol i am just a random guy in a forum telling you what to do wiht your cash lol) jokes apart, its not financial advice, but remember that if you cannot bear the red days, you dont deserve the green.

share what you think, what you can and with whoever you can and even if we all buy $100 of avaya every month, we gonna make this big, but remember that we are not here for meme plays like $amc $gme $bbby, tbh that wouldnt be that bad, but as avaya is not a meme stock, a lot of people will be surprised on the next few quarters all the improvements the ceo is bringing and already putting in practice.  


when they announce that bankruptcy is out of the possibility to happen, we gonna run like usain bolt towards $3-$4  maybe $5 and then lots of people will take profits at this levels, including myself, but after a while in terms of consolidation and bla bla bla and also company keeps improving its financials and expanding the business, we gonna get $10 before any yall imagine.  


avaya is getting very active in marketing since masarek joined, more events, more posts on twitter, even avaya employees and linkedin got way more active with their posts related to their tech and customer and partnerships including  $googl  


i will not take any profits and add until anything under $4 and then later i will take profits when we get closer to $10 and let some run even more.

i am not even sure actually how i will behave as i never saw 6 figures on my balance, but as small you invest more enthusiastic and hunger for knowledge and etc.  


imagine a big boy $msft $googl or even $amzn and say hey whats up $avya what are you up to my puppy? we like your stuff and shit, for that reason we would love to have a cup of tea with you.

1664713546,"many of the points is exactly why i sold my tesla, apple, microsoft stock many months ago.

people are still playing dumb.

you think american stocks are safe if they decide to decouple from china?????

anybody who understands economics and supply chain, will tell you, it’s death for everyone.

i can tell you this nio bottom has less room than tesla bottom (based on everything you mention that threatens trade).

i pray nio 100% shifts all their shares to hk. then we can avoid these dumb posts about “how any decouple would only impact chinese stocks”

anyone with a 401k would understand, you wouldn’t want any decoupling because your 401k is propped by usa business that uses china to generate their recording breaking profits.

ps if your a bear, show your positions. we want to know if we are dealing with a bear with 50 short shares or someone with 5000 short shares.

if you’re a bear, you should buy puts on amd because they make all their chips in taiwan. it’s a better gamble, if you really believe usa will keep screwing with taiwan and china will respond. meanwhile your struggling with a $17 dollar stock with limited downside…wow you might reach $13… go for amd, from $65 to $35 is possible.

possible dips

nio - maybe $13 

amd - maybe a $30 drop

apple - maybe another $40 drop

microsoft - maybe another $100 drop

telsa - they just need some bad news and your looking at a crash. with more ev competition they have more to lose.

lulu- people can’t afford their $80 yoga pants, when you need to eat. at least $100 possible dip.

the list goes on and on about other better stocks to be a bear in this economy.

if you’re a bear in nio at $17, your dumb. if your a bear in nio at $60 congrats to your gains. sell and move to better stocks to be a bear in.",14,,whoareyouwhoisme,0
1664714043,"full disclosure- as an older tech nerd, i do own tesla stock as well as apple stock. tesla stock has grown 10x since 2020… so i don’t think the investors are concerned. no other large company consistently grows production over 50% quarter after quarter. 

people who actually follow tesla’s progress are fully aware of how advanced their autonomous driving is over every other company. only fools are actually expecting robotaxis to flood the roads in the near future. semi trucks have already been delivered to some early customers and they are far better ev trucks than anything on the market today. the cybertruck factory in austin is the largest car factory ever built, and the main design of the vehicle is finalized. expect it to outsell every other ev pickup truck 10:1 the same way tesla ev cars outsell competing ev cars 10:1.

after the ipo the apple ii financially supported the company in a profitable way for quite some time. 

in the late 80s / early 90s there was no future to invest in and the company was poorly run. 

no one was investing at that time because they knew apple had the next great thing. 

and then once jobs returned the company (and fred anderson joined) they actually moved fairly aggressively to be in the black as soon as possible. 

indeed if you wanted to time out an apple stock purchase in the early 2000’s for a long term buy all you would have needed to do is look for consistent profitability. i believe that started to occur in the 2002 timeframe.

this is how i did it. i went to school for hvac which is an in demand job no matter where you live. i didn’t even finish my classes and already was applying for jobs it took applying to dozens of places before someone would hire me. got a entry level job starting at $6 an hour. i took it very seriously and got good after two years i was makingm $14an hour. this was just working on hvac for houses. now i had some experience i applied to companies that only did commercial and industrial jobs. i got a job doing refrigeration for supermarkets like walmart ect.. i was hired at $16 hr. this job had a ton of overtime and lots of on the job training. i worked a minimum of 50 hours a week. after two years i went from $16hr to $22hr. than went to another company that hired me at $25hr. did that another 3 years and was making $32 an hour with a ton of overtime. i  had a company service van so i didn’t pay for gas or wear and tear on my own vehicle. so i saved a lot from that. i also got paid from the time i left my house until the time i got home. i was averaging around $100,000 a year with all the overtime. than i got a job doing strictly industrial refrigeration i was making $42 an hour and had a ton of overtime. i traveled up the east coast. i easily made $115k to $120k a year. 

that whole time i would invest a certain amount of my paycheck every pay. even if it meant being broke after 2 days. i also lived with roommates and my first house i bought i rented the master bedroom out to my sister in law which paid 60% of my mortgage. i got every audio book on finance in my public library system. i started investing in dividend paying stocks. than a coworker convinced me to buy apple stock right before the iphone came out when ipods were a big deal. that was my best stock investment ever. after ten years of saving i had enough money for two down payments on two rental properties. first i bought a triplex and the next year i bought a 4plex. i fixed them up and was able to increase rent significantly. i saved 100% of the money i made in rent and the next year i bought duplex. i just kept repeating. i sold most of my apple stock to buy these properties but i still have much more than my original investment left in apple and it just keeps growing.",5,,Echoes-Pompeii,0

1664866452,"you should subscribe to the /r/personalfinance subreddit and check out their wiki article on investing [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing/).

&gt; how do anyone invest in stocks in reality

- sign up for an account with a stock brokerage, like fidelity, td ameritrade, or schwab.
- they'll tell you how to send money from your bank account.
- a few days (maybe up to a week) after you've sent the money, you can go to their website (or some have mobile apps), enter what stock you want to buy, and how many shares.

&gt; not like how every blog would explain.

what blogs?  what's wrong with their explanation?  what makes you think reddit will give you different / better answers?

&gt; i am trying to understand if money needs to be invested on fixed cadence or you buy stocks for once

when you buy socks is up to you.  if you want to buy a whole bunch of socks tomorrow, you can walk into wal-mart or target and do it.  if you want to buy just a few socks every paycheck, or every month, or every 3 months, you can do that too.

likewise, when you buy stocks is up to you.  if you have $30,000 and want to buy $30,000 worth of microsoft stock tomorrow, you can log into your schwab or td ameritrade account and do it.  if you want to buy $1000 worth of microsoft stock every month for the next 30 months, you can do that too.

some people say it's better to put all your extra money into stocks right away.  the stock market has a long-term upward trend over time, so every day you're not in stocks, you're missing out (according to those people).

other people say it's better to put about the same amount of money into the market on a regular schedule.  humans are creatures of habit, and it's psychologically easier to keep doing something if you do it repeatedly on a schedule.  also the stock market has short-term ups and downs, so if you don't put your money in all at once, you don't have the possibility of putting a huge amount of money in at the worst possible time -- you'll put in a little at the worst possible time, a little at the best possible time, and a little every other month of the year, so it all averages out, and if you stick to it for a decade or more, you're mostly affected by just the upward trend (according to those people).

&gt; then keep track of their value over the time

the website you signed up with (fidelity or whoever) will let you log in anytime and show you a report of how much your stocks are worth (that is, how much money you'd probably get if you sold them right now).

some stock brokerages (for example, td ameritrade) will let you do ""paper trading"", which means if you want to practice, they'll give you fake money you can use to do fake buying and fake selling of stocks.  that way you can see how buying and selling works, what their stock reports look like, and so on.  in other words, paper trading lets you train yourself to use the stock market, without using actual money.

[1] a stock's expensive if it has a high ""p/e ratio"".  a low ""dividend yield"" can also be a sign a stock's too expensive.  if you don't know what those are, look them up.  if you look them up and you can't understand them, you should ask someone to explain it to you on /r/personalfinance.  if you still can't understand them, you probably shouldn't invest in particular companies, and you should buy shares in an s&amp;p 500 index fund instead.",1,,white_nerdy,0

that doesnt mean suits never succeed but you would have to be doing something like buying hooker's homes with corporate profits. its not some iron clad thing where a share holder can sue a company for giving employees raises, or refusing to buy netflix and doubly down on dvds. you cant sue a company for lobbying for higher min, or to end right to work states. well you can sue for anything but you will lose. most times creaming fiduciary duty in court will make the judge look at you like you just said ""im not a driver, im a traveler"" and that other sovereign citizen crap.",1,,powercow,0

- bob writes on a piece of paper ""iou 100 shares of microsoft.  - bob""
- bob sells that piece of paper for $25,000, through the same system used to trade actual shares.

bob has traded a piece of paper for $25,000.  but he doesn't own that $25,000 free and clear; he still has to make good on his iou.

to be sure bob will make good on his iou, bob's stockbroker partly locks his account, to prevent him from withdrawing stocks and money to an extent that he might not be able to make good on his iou.  and as long as bob's short is active, he'll also be charged a percentage fee every day.

if bob eventually wants to unlock all of his stocks and money, and stop being charged fees, he'll have to make good on his iou.  he makes good by delivering the 100 shares of microsoft.

how much does it cost bob to make good on his iou?

- if microsoft stock went down to $200 / share, it costs bob $20,000 to make good on his iou; bob made $5000.
- if microsoft stock went up to $300 / share, it costs bob $30,000 to make good on his iou; bob lost $5000.

every day bob's stockbroker's computer calculates how much it would cost bob to make good on his iou, and compares it to how much stocks and money are in bob's account.  if the numbers start to get too close, and it looks like bob is just a couple market moves away from the stockbroker can seize the stocks and money in bob's account, and use them to make good on his iou.

1664907793,"again, that'd be like saying waymo has ""nothing to do with google"". that's true only if you take the absolute most narrow interpretation of what ""google"" is, which 99.999[...]999% of the time is *not* what people mean when they say ""google"".

we can have as much of a discussion as we want as to how independently the day-to-day operation of the various companies under alphabet operate. but the one thing you need to be clear on is, when people say ""google"", they mean everything that alphabet encompasses, because alphabet is an *evolution* of the corporate entity known as ""google"", not some completely independent entity.

again, there's a *reason* the alphabet stock ticker is goog: the entire entity was just ""google"" originally, and then for legal purposes (likely to preempt antitrust concerns) they decided to instead split the more conceptually distinct operations within the company into separate corporate entities and combine them under a new legal holding entity called ""alphabet"", with ""google""-the-corporate-entity being renamed to a subset of what it used to encompass.

but that's just legal proceedings; when people talk about ""google"" they're using it as a synonym for ""the company larry/sergey used to lead, and now sundar pichai is leading"", which includes waymo and gv. similarly, when people talk about ""facebook"" they're using it as a synonym for ""the company mark zuckerberg is leading"", despite now it *legally* being just the specific product called ""facebook"" in a larger company called ""meta"". (and yes, i know meta hasn't transitioned to a holding company yet, but the etymological point still absolutely parallels google's.)",2,,sabrathos,0

yes. his whole deal is that he's ready, really lucky and therefore thinks life sorts itself out.

he always follows the path of least resistance and always obeys what his momma and jenny told him. even when they're not there. that includes following his friends into business and running away when he feels like it.

he is disproportionately rewarded for this while jenny is published for engaging in social struggle and actively trying to make the world better.  gump doesn't have an opinion on the war, it just works itself out. jenny is silly for trying to question the system when she could just have gotten a waitress job and somehow be awarded some apple stock because she was a good worker.

1664927120,"might as well use this as an opportunity to explain the basics of how stock exchanges execute orders. say we have a, b, c, ... market participants. some have aapl stock registered on the stock exchange and want to sell and some want to buy it. say they have already submitted (limit) orders like:

    a: buy 10 aapl $10
    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    c: sell 1000 aapl $15
    d: sell 10 aapl $11

the stock exchange execution engine keeps track of all active orders in an order book sorted by price:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 10 aapl $10
    d: sell 10 aapl $11
    c: sell 1000 aapl $15

at this point the buy sell spread is $11-$10 = $1.
new order comes in: `e: buy 1 aapl $11.1`. stock exchange matches it in the order book with the sell for $11 and e gets 1 share for $11 usd. aapl ticker price shows $11. order book updated to:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 10 aapl $10
    d: sell 9 aapl $11
    c: sell 1000 aapl $15

f puts in a buy 20 aapl 'market' order. stock exchange executes the order as if it was `f: buy 10 aapl $insert_large_number_here` so f ends up buying 20 aapl for 9\*$11 + 11\*$15=$264. not great.
last shares were sold at $15 so aapl ticker price jumps to $15. update:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 10 aapl $10
    c: sell 989 aapl $15

h sees the enticing $15 ticker price so puts a new 'market' sell order that the stock exchange processes it like `h: sell 1 aapl $0`. the order is matched with the buy at $10 so that's how much h actually gets. aapl ticker now shows $10.

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 9 aapl $10
    c: sell 989 aapl $15

spread: $5.
d who also saw the $15 ticker, wanted to sell too but was careful enough to put a $12 limit so now we're at:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 9 aapl $10
    d: sell 10  aapl $12
    c: sell 989 aapl $15

i come in and put a limit order to sell 1 aapl for $12.38.

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 9 aapl $10
    d: sell 10  aapl $12
    i: sell 1 aapl $12.38
    c: sell 989 aapl $15

spread: $2. people who put in market orders will have to pay the spread cost. but j says fuck your spreads so uses a $10.1 limit order. result:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 9 aapl $10
    j: buy 2 aapl $10.1
    d: sell 10  aapl $12
    i: sell 1 aapl $12.38
    c: sell 989 aapl $15

someone else market sells 2 aapl and basically incurs the spread cost. so now we're back to:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    a: buy 9 aapl $10
    d: sell 10  aapl $12
    i: sell 1 aapl $12.38
    c: sell 989 aapl $15

aapl ticker updated to $10.1. days pass, aapl ticker stays between $10 and $12.2. new order book:

    b: buy 1000 aapl $1
    x: buy 100 aapl $10.4
    y: buy 10 aapl $12
    z: sell 10 aapl $12.2
    i: sell 1 aapl $12.38
    c: sell 1000 aapl $12.45

now ticker price briefly jumps to $12.45 as an order is executed. i now expect my $12.38 limit order to have been executed before c got to sell at $12.45. but i'm using trading212 and turns out trading212 never actually sent my limit order to the stock exchange. why the fuck didn't you trading212?",8,,nqudex,0

can ios run games built for linux? linux games seem to get more priority from crackers than mac. if so, that might be the way to go.

apple has never really pushed the mac as a gaming platform, but a productivity platform, which is a big reason the mac has never been popular with computer gamers. 

add to that the fact that for many years, you couldn't upgrade a mac without going to apple for mac specific hardware, at inflated prices. i know that has since changed, but it's too late. 

steve jobs simply ignored gamers as a potential driver for his platform, unlike bill gates, and developers and crackers followed accordingly.

whoever runs apple these days doesn't seem interested in capturing any market share in computer gaming.

in my opinion, if it weren't for the ipod and iphone lines, apple would have gone out of business long ago, and they nearly did, until gates stepped in and bought millions of dollars worth of apple stock as a favor to jobs.

it took me about 10 years to completely understand and have cools to deal with my depression.  today i like to think i'm doing okay considering the massive stress my life has been under the last 10 years.  and i'll get down every so often, but i know why now and how to pick myself up and get moving again.

true that on will power.  i didn't believe that until i saw my dad at 76 years of age teach himself to play the piano in 3 weeks.  and he had really declined in terms of his analytical skills and logical skills so i didn't think he was capable.  but he set his mind to it and he did it.  and that was just a few weeks before he got covid and ended up in the icu.  (this was before a vaccine even existed.)  he fought for 2 months and in the end he was covid free.  but the damage to his lungs was never going to let him live a normal life again and he had been sedated for nearly 2 months.  i knew he was still in there because when i would cry, his vitals would get messed up until i told him that i won't cry and he needs to get his vitals normal again.  it was a sad day when i had to let him go, but his body was starting to break down and when i put my hand on his forehead it was basically his skull.  i told him what we were going to do and let him know where everything stood (i worked along side him for nearly 10 years), and he was fine with everything or his vitals would have jumped.  after support was pulled he went quietly and peacefully in 3 minutes.  at least he wasn't going to be alone--we lost our mom the year earlier.  anyways, didn't mean to go down a tangent--but his mind was strong even until the end, and he beat covid with sheer raw will power.  he didn't let it take him.  his advance directive dictated how he went (that's what we followed).",1,,SamirD,0

* one of you gets married
* one of you wants to sell
* one of you gets struck by lightning

basically the real problem is figuring out how to end joint ownership.

the advantage...  you're living rent free, payment free.  we paid off our mortgage a few years ago, and it's nice.  we still have property taxes and electricity and repairs that need to be done, but it is cheaper than renting or having a mortgage..  so my income goes to investing.

you are my son's age; he just started his big-boy job earlier this year.  right now he's saving an emergency fund and investing into his 401k.  that's a workplace retirement account.  many employers will match to some extent what you invest; my son is putting just enough in to maximize the company match.

i think a 401k is a good place to start because:

1. everybody needs a fund to finance retirement
2. your employer offers a limited set of funds and having your universe narrowed is good when starting out from zero.

i recommend mutual funds - which are investments of a bunch of investments.  so you can limit your risk.  if, say, apple turns out to be a shell of a company that's been making bad investments and stealing from people...  if you own apple stock then you will lose your investment.  if you own a *mutual fund* that owns apple, then the mutual fund would lose that investment, and yeah, the value of that mutual fund would take a small hit as a result.

people around here are enamored with index funds.  they are a subset of mutual funds that rather than hiring some high-paid hotshot to make investment choices, they follow a market index... like the s&amp;p 500.  or the russell 2000.  as a result, they're cheaper to operate.

so i started trading at the start of this year (jan 2022) after just hearing about it mentioned during one of the streams i watched on twitch regarding a new game i was playing (which i really regret watching now in hindsight). i saw some stock charts at the start of the year and saw that most stocks were rising, and was basically very bullish then. i did not trade options initially and put them mostly into stocks like $amzn, $appl, $nvda, and ev stocks as they were being highly hyped like $nio.  
  
needless to say, i suffered great losses just a couple months in and panicked. i then looked into how to quickly recover my losses, and came across options (big mistake) and penny stocks. i spent a few days reading up on it through online websites, understood the basics of it, and dived straight in. this was around mid-march, and i did initially make some money as there were some rallies, and i believed the market was recovering since a crash is usually quicker. again, i was completely wrong, lost a lot of money on options, especially when i fomoed into oil stocks and it dropped massively at one point.  
  
it just kept going downhill from there and i put in a significant portion of my monthly salary into trading everyday, and then i went into spy 0dte/1dte/3dte options and could lose what i put in within days, even if at points i was up like 500%+ from what i initially put in (like at point i put in $1k, got to $12k, then to $0).  
  
i just got blown out again today betting on a reversal for $spy, using 0dte call options, as i felt it was bullish given the first 3 days of this week (the 3rd day had a reversal), and i felt the big drop at the start was a massive overreaction, doubling down on a losing position, hoping to recover some losses. i did not put a stop loss because i did not want to believe this play would lose and i would have bought back in soon anyway after a small rally. obviously, i was wrong and now am left with less than $500 in my bank, with debts still to pay.  
  
i'm too much of a loser to kill myself as i'm scared, and euthanasia isn't available in my country as i would very much like to go out painlessly with a lethal injection right now if possible.

when the company does well and turns a profit, those that own shares get a portion of that profit, in the form of dividends, the more shares they own, the more money they will get.

the price of the share is based off of how much people are willing to buy/sell the stock, usually based off of how well the company is doing and how much the dividends pay out.

3.  avoiding the financial industry for “morality”… just show lack of understanding.

 first there so many people trading: individuals, small companies and large once.. why should the large one stop so the small one will make a killing? 
last time i checked it’s not communism here.

also, without hft when buying a stock you won’t be able to know if the price is fair… if all the news and c updated prediction are in the stock price. you willis have to hire an army of engineers to make sure you compare all prices at all exchanges per every buy/sell.
also that will need to happen very fast to allow fast buy and sell…otherwise the amount of transactions per day will be limited…. this lag will reduce activity and investments.

the basic arbitrage trade and a like - is critical to fair play and it’s the best way to insure fair and updated prices.

when you buy a stock, does it matters where you buy it (some stone are traded in 2 places)?
if you buy apple stock don’t you want to make sure samsung phone didn’t just (few seconds ago) had all their batteries explode? are you gonna check the news?

then i caught my husband running with his secretary. i got my ducks in a row and divorced him. he never saw it coming.

he used to give me $25 a week for the the groceries,  and things the kids and i needed. the judge gave me $1000 a week, the equity in our house, alimony for 10 years,  regular upgrades in childcare, and half of the 401k. a good attorney is worth their weight in gold. oh, and the judge ordered him to give me a certain amount to buy a car. i didn't have a car or know anyone where we lived. the judge thought that was insane, given that we lived in a fancy house and my ex made plenty of money.

i went to school and acquired skills for a career. i invested the 401k money in apple stock. blessings!

also, it was court ordered that my ex pay for all of my attorney and court fees. his girlfriend dumped him because he didn't have any money left. boo hoo!",254,,Daisysrevenge,1

you said ""the only reason to purchase elongate tokens is to sit on them and hope there’s an altcoin buying frenzy again"". like i said, nobody is buying eg for that reason when there are many better options.

&gt; they aren’t spending it and there is no other use for it.

why would anyone spend it? and obviously there isn't a real utility for the token, just like &gt;99% of all cryptos. people don't buy 99% of crypto tokens to ever spend or ""use"" it. even tokens with utility, most just buy hoping for gains rather than to use it for anything. mana is a prime example. a billion dollar token but almost nobody actually uses it in-game.

&gt; i don’t know how to look at the token itself as anything more than a ponzi scheme-ish gamble where my money (and yours) is made on the backs of others

how do you think any investment ever goes up? from people spending money. eg developed products to bring value to the token investment, like how other companies sell products to generate revenue. it doesn't matter whether it's nike or apple stock going up from people buying sneakers and iphones, or eg going up from businesses using the salesforce exchange. it's money coming in from outside that isn't just people buying the stock/token. that's why it's not really comparable to a ponzi. of course nobody has used the exchange yet, but if nobody chooses to buy sneakers/phones and nike/apple still sell stock, that doesn't make them a ponzi.",2,,sophgoac,0

firms thought they smelled opportunity thanks ever increasing prices of everything tech related, phones, consoles, cpu, gpu and ram. 

so they want part of that. 
especially as more people nowadays are open to pcs thanks to normalizing during covid and how popular streaming and gaming got in last decade.
so the audience broadened, while supply was constrained due to covid.

they forgot one thing, we are in looming global recession (and already recession in us). 
last thing people will be worried are luxury products, so demand already gone down considerably.
plus there is no more scarcity in tech industry, you can get anything now at any time. 
so people who got choice will decide to wait for cheaper options or get last gen and just wait. 
instead save that buck for more important things currently, like stoxkpilling firewood, water and provisions in eu.

my estimate is we will see 5080 at 699$ msrp again and zen 2 prices again with zen 5, haha.

but ignoring that, amd was basically matching nvidia's cards in rasterization performance at similar/lower prices and they were only selling what they were due to lack of nvidia stock. the average person just doesn't trust amd when it comes to gpu's due to perceived lack of quality .

it like why if you asked the average american whether they would want a $1,000 iphone or a $1,000 android phone they would pick the iphone every time.

even from my perspective of knowing amd gpu doesn't = shit, if you give me an option to choose and amd card or an nvidia card at the same performance level and price i'd choose the nvidia card.

i think people are huffing hopium if they think amd is going to release a card that matches the 4090 at a notably lower price. 

i don't see them putting out a card that can match the performance, but i see them putting out a card that's close in rasterization performance but loses in ray tracing performance and costs around $1400. 

are people forgetting amd's top card last gen (6900xt) cost $300 less than a 3080/6800xt with less than a 10% improvement in performance over them and technically lost to the 3080 in ray traced games.

i had a bunch of movies that were not in folders and radarr did not like that. instead of manually moving them all into their respective folder (say `/movie (2000).mkv` -&gt; `/movie (2000)/movie (2000).mkv`) i made a quick and dirty powershell script to do that for me. just change the extension to whatever files are to be moved:


    $vs = dir *.mkv
    
    foreach($v in $vs)
    {
        $file = $v.basename

    }        

i am sure it could be condensed and optimized but it worked.

it will not remove or move things into existing folders, it just iterates the directory where it is executed from and if a folder does not exist it makes it and moves the file there. any others are left where they were. actually as a happy accident because of this it found a few duplicate movies saving me some storage space.

1665695246,"people laughed at people with cars when the roads catered to horseback riding and carriages. saddle makers sold more saddles when vehicles were first started to be manufactured more and they even wrote reports and released news articles about this new ‘fad’ of ‘driving cars’. fast forward some decades. wide adoptions inevitably takes place in society. jokes on them, their saddle companies are long gone, and car manufacturers have replaced all of them. 

right now, people find it cool still to shit on mark zuckerberg, meta, and the ‘metaverse’, but time will come back around and the jokes will be on us in the end, when we look around as old people and see the entire world shaped by technology using virtual and augmented reality.

humans are better with technology and why people are so standoffish about the vr metaverse is everything one needs to see to understand how massive this transformation will actually be. 

steve jobs inventing the iphone may be one of the single greatest impactful inventions in history, imo. and imo, mark zuckerberg turning into meta and creating his own version of the metaverse will be right behind it as also one of the most impactful inventions ever made by a human. time will tell. he will either adapt to the shifting market years from now and find some sort of success someway somehow, or he will simply continue pressing forward with the vision he has now and the world will slowly but surely come to cling onto it and only be left wondering why we didn’t all jump onto this sooner. 

looking into most technology, almost everything being used today was a very, extremely, severely, dumbed down version then when it was first created, than of what it is now, after going through mass adoption and constant innovation.

people may be laughing at zuck’s avatar legs now, but will be wearing his smart goggles, fitness trackers, recording devices, motion sensors, etc, in no time. 

people are severely underestimating the populations willingness to be an active part of a digital universe.

people pay thousands for regular stuff that just displays some random designer brand’s logos, for looks and popularity and recognition. people pay thousands for .jpeg images of monkeys because they’re associated with something that other people with lots of money and notoriety like to claim a certain status through ownership of the image.  people pay for stupid shit all the time, and the trend is only getting more extreme as modern society has shown. people in the future will not only pay meta for access to the metaverse, but will pay for items and things of value within the metaverse itself as well. ‘digital real estate’ will be a thing, and lots of people will be wealthy in real life because of their ‘work’ inside of a virtual world. 

i mean just take a look at the video game grand theft auto v. sold billions and billions of copies. all to human beings. that sit down and stare at a screen to play it. it’s just a portion of los angeles, ca in real life simulated into a digital world that you can maneuver through as a playable character that you can fully customize and control. the fact that you can steal cars, speed in them, crash them, go wherever you want in them, without any actual real world repercussions, is exactly why so many people play it, and it’s exactly why mark knows his metaverse will work. real world interactions and real world activities but without any real world consequences. it already has worked before, just on a completely different scale that doesn’t even touch up to the concept that he is bringing to it. why society doesn’t see how obvious it is how this whole thing will eventually play out is beyond me. 

mark my words. zuck will be respected and recognized far more than he ever was for facebook for his role in pioneering the shift into the business of virtual worlds and augmented reality. i would say $meta to the moon but i am in no way an investor of this company. i just see how history has played out thus far and can see how it could possibly play in from here on out, and zuck is in a very nice spot if you ask me.

a couple major events to watch out for:

 - $tsla's earnings on the 19th: personally i'm moderately bullish, but also anticipating either more selling from elon after it rallies or elon pumping it as high as possible to use as collateral for the twitter buyout (and wouldn't put it past him to be telling the banks ""oh, don't you worry - just watch what i can do to the shares"").


 - $aapl's earnings next week: i'm rather bearish on this - i think inflation is going to hit apple harder than most people realize, but i've always been a linux fan and apple / m$ hater, so don't quote me on that.

think of it like this. apple stock was sold for $22 when they first launched stocks. thats what the company evaluated it at (basically their msrp).  you dont go crying to people who bought the stock for $22 selling it for $150 saying its only fair to sell it at what the suggested retail value was.

instead, zuck has leveraged his position to force fb into a direction that few believe in. it's a classic folly of one driven my megalomania.

1665744327,"&gt;the reason both the left and right have argued for a complete ban of trading for elected representatives is that it's impossible to detangle their power from the market.

what is this ""both the left and the right"" guff? i haven't seen anyone on the right ask for this until headlines about nancy pelosi started appearing on fox. a couple years ago, i would routinely argue with conservatives who were against such a ban, and indeed most republicans in office have been against such a ban -- this was when it was almost exclusively republican congresspeople who were implicated in shady trades during the early stages of the pandemic.

i see absolutely zero reason to believe that the right's stance on congresspeople trading is a function of principled stances and every reason to believe it's a reaction they think will hurt democrats more than republicans.

&gt;pelosi is capable of knowing things which will drastically influence markets and companies months - or years - before they happen.

that's great, but her and her husband's trades are public. can you point to any specific trades that capitalized on insider information? because as far as i can tell he just bought a bunch of $nvda at a time when half of reddit was also buying $nvda.

&gt;some people, such as pelosi, are against this sort of ban wholeheartedly, and have stalled any attempt to pass it.

nancy pelosi has publicly expressed support for such a ban. the headlines suggesting she's against it are from a couple years ago when conservative media was starting to rag on her husband, at a time when there were dozens of republicans implicated in lying about covid to their constituents in order to manipulate their own portfolios and there was little will on either side to persue such a ban.

&gt;while pelosi has softened her stance, she hasn't put her weight behind getting anything done, and nothing has been done.

what exactly does this mean? can you give me something concrete she should be doing but hasn't done?

&gt;there is a reason that congressmen that buy individual stocks routinely beat the market, and it's not because they're stock prodigies.

virtually anyone who's not planning on retiring in 2 years can routinely beat the market. we're not talking about like, some mj penny stocks; we're talking about things like google and amazon.",0,,john12tucker,0

1665794750,"i think “no fault of their own” speaks to the problem i’m pointing out. no, it’s not their fault. but it’s not an entitlement either. it’s like every other market in the history of markets. 

a lot of people can’t afford shares of apple stock either. but i absolutely remember when i bought a bunch of it for $5 / share. 

but this was when steve wasn’t working there, before the ipod, and just after their first imac experiment - which wasn’t hugely successful. 

so yea, i could buy shares for $5. so why didn’t i buy 10000s of shares? because they weren’t valuable. the company didn’t seem valuable to me. i didn’t want to waste a bunch of money. so i didn’t. i proceeded with caution. 

this is the point that seems to get lost. 20 years ago i could have easily bought a string of houses for $120k each. i’d be very rich today. but, despite them being affordable to me, they didn’t have any value at the time. they were just heavy assets that i had no idea would appreciate as they have and so i’d have to cover those risks. 

prices keep going up because the market appears valuable to people. same reason apple shares are worth so much now. sure, you can’t afford as many, but that’s because the level of risk is so nominal. apple isn’t going anywhere. and it’s clear now that austin is going to keep growing. hence the prices keep going up. 

that wasn’t always so. and that’s largely what drives the price of the market increases. so no, they’re not affordable to most people any longer. but those people who have money can buy them up and hope they retain or increase value. and they likely will - so you pay a premium for that.

if you can't sort the original data, copy the original table of data to a new, blank worksheet and sort the copy and use it with the formulas above. if you then need to sort that into the same row order as the original table, copy the range of formulas and paste-special as values onto itself. then add another column of formulas.

first of all, its about to crash into reality. fb/meta stock is in the tank. they did a study recently and found out that on one of their apps, they had all of 80-some users. 83? 84? for a platform that cost billions to develop. zuck and co are about to either go fluffing bankrupt or be bought out. 

meta itself also has a lot of issues. for example: they swore you would never have to log into fb to use it. lie. when fb and meta completely merge (which is coming) you won't able to log in without merging fb/meta/ occulus. 

second, if you get banned from fb (i'm sorry, meta) for any reason, you can't log into your occulus. i got banned recently for 30 days for saying i would burn an inanimate, cursed doll if left on my stairs (doll in the hall). i was apparently ""inciting violence""....against an inanimate cursed object. so think about it. if you start using the occulus/meta for work and you get banned from fb (sorry, meta) for, i don't know, posting about a cursed doll.....you could get banned from meta. locking you out of all of your work apps and games. good idea? i don't think so.

1665889635,"&gt; pelosi's husband is fuckin' famous

no he's not. i already pointed you to the right dataset to refute the one factual claim you made to back this bullshit up (you tried to claim outperforming s&amp;p 500 in 2020 was somehow extraordinary despite it being the _best year on record_ for people beating the s&amp;p 500. half of firms beat it in 2020). 

&gt; ""if?"" prove it then.

how the hell can i prove what politifact did when they don't tell us what methodology they used? the point of their making that 100m claim was simply to point out how ridiculous 196m is. that's all. both articles we cited from politifact are talking about her net worth (or growth in net worth) not about how much her husband made via trading, and we're here discussing *insider trading*. this isn't complicated. you tried to claim she's insider trading. you backed that claim up by showing her net value going up. that's simply a non-sequitur. that's why i told you you were being led astray by bullshit memes. because you are. 

now, i'm happy to dig into some examples of how the net worth change might be calculated so you can understand where you're going wrong. let's look just at their apple holdings. here's her [2018 disclosure](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2018/10026982.pdf), and here's her [2020 draft disclosure](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2019/10035243.pdf). look at the schedule a (first pages) and note the value of her apple holding and how big the category is (5-25m). that's why there's this big range in her estimated worth between sources. some assume she holds 5m worth, others assume she holds 25m worth, and we just don't know. but, whatever, let's look at how much she made from apple stock just from holding it on both the low and high end. 

in may 2018, apple was priced at about $46 per share. in aug of  2020, apple was trading at $112 per share. so, if pelosi held 5m in stock (the low end), that means she made 12.5m. if she had 25m, then her gains would be **62 million**. that alone would account for the bulk of her net worth growing from 90m in 2016 to ~155m in 2018 to ~163 in 2020. so, can you see why it's always about ""by some estimates"" and how it requires no insider trading over the trump administration years to have big swings in net worth? that's one stock. one. she also held at least 500k in amazon in 2016 which went from $29-&gt;$160. and most of her net worth is in her land, not in her stock (according to opensecrets.org). we also know that the value of land in san fran (where her most valuable properties are) have risen steadily since 2016. i don't have access to historical data for the financial district in sf, so i can't do what i just did with the apple stock, but land has (as far back as we have disclosures) always been the core of her value. combine the value gained by holding stock with the bulk of her value coming from real-estate, and there's not really any growth left to attribute to insider trading. you can see the size of the value of her active trades in 2018 ... it's not even close to 100m. there's just no way that the insider trading claim can account for the gains we see documented. it's just total bullshit pushed by folks with some agenda/bias and a lack of willingness to follow the data. 

at the end of the day, saying that pelosi made a shitload of money during the trump presidency is literally just saying that the market performed well while trump was potus, and land value did was land value has done for decades in sf. it's not an indication of insider trading, it's an indication of how well those generating wealth via trading were able to do by holding good stock in a juiced market.

ok, so you think pramilla jayapal and ro khanna are not progressives? you think bernie isn't a progressive because he supported the '94 crime bill which was clearly not progressive legislation? don't dodge. be consistent. 

&gt; siding against unions

the railroad deal was made with the fucking union leadership. what are you even talking about? the fact that the federal government has the power to force critical industries to do stuff doesn't automatically put the biden admin (who did the damn deal) against the unions. and, by the way, the goddamned union members rejected the deal, so at the end of the day ... what are you even complaining about here? as of 5 days ago, a strike is back on the table. and do you honestly believe that ""for the greater good"" deals are never made by progressives? get real. i've pointed to the '94 crime bill multiple times now, and you haven't had a damned thing to say about that, have you? is bernie a progressive or not? was his vote for the '94 crime bill progressive? why doesn't that dq him in your mind? be honest. what about his positions on gun control? he still allowed to be a progressive?

a lot of this is well known to the markets and has been priced in, but amd’s pre announced q3 earnings week before last are definitely not a good sign for the sector. if you were to put fresh capital to work here, i would highly advise against intel as there are better opportunities in txn and mu, but if you do, do it with 50% of what you want to and then make a promise to yourself to just wait. i’m sure you’ll get better prices by jan, but if not you can always take the other 50% and put it into a semi etf.",2,,JaxTaylor2,0

super simple method for price action: enter when you have confirmation, set stop a few cents below obvious pivot/resistance, sell 50% at target 1 and move your stop to breakeven, let the rest ride your trailing stop with an alert on it.  this guarantees you make at least a little bit each trade.

super simple method for trend trading:  same as above, but use the atr value and multiply by 2.  it gives you a wide enough stop that you can often times see continuation on day 2 without worry.  

another easy method is you should keep stats.  i know that 75% of my trades are winners and the average winner is 1.6x my avg. loser.  a smart man (which i am not) would probably set their take profit level at 1.5x their entry, take 75% of the profits off the table at that level and then let the rest ride in case it wants to keep going, or be more like a one and done trader, sell all of it at 1.5-1.6r and move on to the next setup.

opts out and walks simple as that... opts in and we pay the balloon year and lacob just lied to us... is traded without conjecture on the option for expirings this season if his play or behavior go sideways (in that scenario we don't really get value back cuz he's basically a salary dump... hell we might toss our pick in to sweeten the pot).

snt is nearly impossible imo cuz you hardcap yourself and philosophically that's reserved for high leverage players and stars. snts are for teams under the cap or superstars.  snts are generally to get the player to a number he couldn't get elsewhere.  so i don't think thats actually feasible.

someone else is traded i'd possible bit i think that's overcomplicating a simple and historically true fact.  you pay a little extra for great young players and you move away from expensive old players. we did it with bogut lee, iguodala and stretch sdot. we all love dray but 35 year old dray at 25m gets in the way of 25 year old wiseman and 23 year old kuminga.  there's only five players on the court at once and father time is undefeated.

the one thing that i'd most neglected is finances always exist in a continuity.  we think of it as a year to year thing.  imagine if we never paid 80m for oubre? that'd maybe be 80m we'd spend more easily over the next three years. who knows.  so when you pay an old guy that is moving to the bench as youngsters are ascending you are forsaking the future value principle of finance.  you dint pay more for tesla or apple stock because it used to be good.  you pay because you expect it to continue moving upward.  no business would pay for something that would certainly deteriorate other products in your portfolio (dray getting extended longterm at almost any dollar amount devalues the future impact value of kuminga wiseman and pbj).  

it's tricky but i'm sure the decision matrix is already set. all the future cap increases and bri estimated and all hypotheticals worked through.  they're just gonna sit back and enjoy the season.  let 2024 worry about itself for a bit.",3,,[deleted],0

1666081489,"i saw in this [article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/carl-icahn-netflix-apple-stock-40-billion-windfall-billionaires-investing-2021-10) that c.i. had invested heavily in netflix before it split its shares seven for one in 2015.  

here is some cut n paste:  

&gt;carl icahn sold his massive stakes in netflix and apple more than five years ago, missing out on over $40 billion in prospective gains.  
  
the billionaire investor and icahn enterprises chairman first bought netflix stock in the third quarter of 2012, and quickly amassed as many as 38.5 million shares, adjusted for the video-streaming platform's 7-for-1 stock split in 2015.  
  
""netflix was a no-brainer when we first went into it,"" icahn told cnbc in june 2015, citing the company's huge war chest.  
  
icahn's roughly 9% stake in netflix rose in value to over $1.7 billion by late 2013. however, the investor steadily reduced it over the next few quarters, and exited the holding entirely in the second quarter of 2015.  
  
""as a hardened veteran of seven bear markets, i have learned that when you are lucky and/or smart enough to have made a total return of 457% in only 14 months, it is time to take some of the chips off the table,"" he explained in a securities and exchange commission filing at the time.  
  
still, he might regret the move today. netflix's stock price has skyrocketed more than 10-fold since icahn's exit, and closed at a record $613 last friday. at its peak, the investor's stake would be worth about $24 billion today.  
  
icahn made a similar bet on apple. he first invested in the iphone maker in the third quarter of 2013, and built his stake to 211 million shares by mid-2014, adjusted for the 4-for-1 stock split last year. the position grew in value to about $6.6 billion by mid-2015.  
  
the investor tweeted that apple stock was ""extremely undervalued"" in august 2013, and he told the wall street journal the bet was a ""no-brainer"" given apple's rich potential to repurchase shares.  
  
regardless, icahn exited the position in early 2016, citing concerns about demand in china. apple's stock price has surged more than five-fold since then, meaning if the investor hadn't sold, he could be sitting on a stake worth up to $30 billion today.  
  
it's worth emphasizing that icahn made a few billion dollars of profit on his netflix and apple bets. however, his combined stakes in the two companies would be worth more than $50 billion today if he hadn't cashed out. that includes well over $40 billion in unrealized gains, all other things being equal.

i did like it, but that's because i had the short story and a general love for king. my friend, who does not read his work, didn't get that enjoyment you get from seeing your imagination come to life on a screen. it's certainly not a bad movie, not even a bad king adaptation because it stayed fairly true to his story.


though being honest i'm sad they changed the way the bully died. kings version is much funnier to me. 


all that being said i thought the acting was good, especially mr. harrigan himself. it looked good, and the first part where their relationship took root hooked me into watching the rest of the movie. as has already been said though. it's not much of a horror. more coming of age, with a lot less ""future telling"" than was in the short story. less apple stock mentioned isn't a bad thing haha.",3,,reaper1833,0

no it isn't. people realise a stock moving from 105 to 300 in a split second is unusual. also people invest because supply meets demand. there's enough demand at 105 to sustain it. but if you artificially alter the market dynamic its not going to make people think that the stock is 'worth' 300.

1666111670,"personal computing accessories is an interesting play. there are too many unknowns to form an opinion or even guess.

* inflation concentrated at the top supports ever increasing prices, but with pc buyers declining and gaming targeting mostly mobile or cross platform, investors should have an expectation of dramatically falling revenue from purchases from lower volume.
* a need to upgrade is less motivating, since performance improvements are too minor due to nearing the constraints of materials and design for processing and storage.
* ghastly performance correlations with size and required energy are reaching the limit of consumer base tolerance.

so, what we see is that the historic motives for regular pc graphics improvements is still there, but the proportion of people affected by them is decreasing quickly. releasing new higher performant chips or cards is not a guarantee of increased revenue. producing the highest quality is no longer a strategy to increase profit. likewise, having historically more marketshare does not lend to predicting dominance. even if inflation went unabated, leading the pack in pc graphics adapters while maintaining old business strategies is becoming an ignored risk. do you want to invest in a company that fails to factor all risks? is nvda stock of one of those companies?",2,,nota80T,0

the fact the company wasn't willing to pay her requested fee shows their estimate of the financial value she brings to the franchise, and i suspect their instincts are more correct than hers. i've never in my life purchased a video game based on the voice actors, or even thought of them at all other than ""they did a mediocre/good/awesome job"". that's not to say that good voice actors don't matter, but specific voice actors don't matter. if there's young talent willing to do it for less than her 6 figures + residuals then her bargaining power is a lot less than say, actual movie actors who can't be replaced that easily without it being a lot more jarring.

i think you can safely rely on that formula *if you compute it using the assumption that all of your put options are immediately/simultaneously exercised by the buyer.*  so, if you sell a put option that would cost $10,000 to exercise, you’re good as long as you currently have the margin available to buy $10,000 of stock. if you currently hold apple stock worth $100,000, and have $0 in cash, and it gets exercised today, you have no problem. it’ll be bought on margin. but what if the value of apple crashes before the put option expires, so it’s only worth $2k? then you’ll have an issue. 

i can’t tell you what the actual formula is though. i’ve taken the trial and error approach. not for a lack of trying to understand. 

i can give you a rough example. i had sold a put option for spy with a strike price of $335 and an exercise date in december of this year. i had enough cash to cover that one single put option if exercised ($33,500) (but only that one — i’ve sold others….). i decided to close the position. cost me $700 cash to close the position. my cash went down by $700. my margin requirements went down by about $2,500.

1666249824,"i guess it very much depends on the circumstances. the vast majority of mortgages are spread over such a long time, i'd say that it's actually a super risky debt to undertake, because so much could happen that goes against you over such a long period whether its the economy, your health or whatever that the deck is stacked against most people.

if someone travels a lot, or can invest their money prudently in assets that generate decent consistent returns, it could arguably be better to put their money to work rather than speculating that their property will be worth more than they paid for it in 40+ years time or whatever.

what's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander.

i'd go as far as to say student debt, mortgage debt &amp; marriage debt are very much the causes of many of the ills and problems in a lot of people's lives.

renting is generally more 'expensive' in terms of monthly payments and can be considered a 'sunken' cost for the reasons you suggest (enriching someone else) but also offer a lot more flexibility.

if anyone in the last decade had put their deposit money into bitcoin for example rather than into a mortgage and were renting, they'd be far better off financially today than they are.

similarly, anyone who bought amazon or tesla or apple stock or a myriad of others, or a diverse portfolio containing all of the above, or whatever.

this is especially so i'd argue in the modern world where the whole great reset style 'own nothing and be happy' mantra seems to be the direction we are taking.

it could be argued there is little point in owning a property outright if someone like blackrock is just going to monopolise and own the market and can crush the value of your equity on a whim in order to get you repo'd.

the boomer generations since wwii to present have had it better than pretty much any generation in recent modern history, and for them, a mortgage was a great idea.

however, their circumstances are actually very rare when we look across modern history and not particularly representative of the circumstances most people face.

for the vast majority of people across the vast majority of modern human history, owning tangible physical property is actually a seriously risky endeavour, since it can easily be taken away, rugpulled, confiscated, bombed, devalued etc.

and by the way, some advice from a veteran: it's not really necessary to have an arena for moon lord, you can just use the broom or o.v.n.i. mount for movement and nurse for healing, for that just put a bed in her house then when you need to cure in battle, use a magic mirror for fast transport, i guarantee that nurse is going to be just fine, since she can heal herself quickly and most of moon lord's attacks only deals a small amount of damage.

1666285907,"not necessarily. it's complicated because you're not thinking about what it takes to run a business.

let's say you buy an iphone for $1000. apple has to pay employees to design that phone at for $100,000 to $200,000 / year. they also have to buy all of the materials to make that phone. they also need to pay back people for returns. they also need to pay for rent for the beautiful campuses. they also need to get insurance in case there is fire, or theft, or someone sues them.

after all is said and done, apple maybe makes $250 on that phone.

then, just because apple makes $250 on the phone the phone doesnt' mean that they will just give you the 0.1% of the $250 (or $0.25). they need to think about and research new camera and touch screen technology for $1,000,000.  in order to pay for that, they are going to need to sell 4000 phones before anything is left over.

after all of that, maybe on each phone they sell, they make $10 after they have paid for everything. your 0.1% of $10 is now $0.01.

then, they won't just take that 1 cent and give it to you, they want to save it (like you do when you save your money) in case something bad happens. so you don't get anything. what does happen is because for every phone that was sold, apple made $10, the value of the apple stock you now own is worth more, so your shares of apple totaling 0.1% might be worth more. for example, if apple was worth $1 billion dollars, and after 1 year they made $10 per phone they are now worth $1.1 billion dollars, your 0.1% is worth more money.",5,,fftsteven,0

look at brrr like this.  apple stock is currently trading at $143.  if you were able to buy it for $28 today, do a some work, then make a deal to get $30 back in cash while still owning the $143 apple stock.  

so now you have your original $28 back, an extra $2 and one $143 apple stock.

the new z lacks in many ways. yes they can be fixed with mods but why should i modify a car to handle as well as my current one (which is modified but i'm referring to stock v stock).

i would rather a slight increase in power to position it solidly between the zupra and subyota.

1666556723,"no worries - glad that you found the suggestions useful.

the canadian deposit receipts (cdrs) was a suggestion to hedge against foreign exchange. i didn’t know whether you had us or cdn to start with. 

everything here is not financial advice, just my own personal opinion. buying stocks in us dollars might be the go to, if you have us dollars lying around. main argument for this is the rise in strength of the us dollar as countries are buying it up. the fomc is also planning on doing two more rate hikes before the end of this calendar year, so that will only further drive up the us dollar. short term wise, this may be the go to until markets cool down.

simply put, cdrs are a way to hedge against forex. it works better when cdn dollar appreciates, not when us dollar appreciates.

opening positions, that’s the question of the century. people here will chirp “just dollar cost average it weekly/monthly” or things like “it’s time in the market, not timing the market”. well right now that doesn’t mean crap when everything’s going down the toilet. there are schedules on various subreddit forums with critical macroeconomic events - gdp numbers, cpi, fomc rate hikes, fomc members speaking, company quarterly earnings, etc. you need to be aware of these numbers if you plan on investing, ignore what other people say. imagine buying in to google or facebook right now, not knowing that their earnings are literally coming out this week, something that could literally make or break them at such a pivotal time. if you don’t believe me, look at $meta from the last three earnings or heck even how they reacted after snapchat released their numbers this past week. don’t coin flip this crap - wait for the numbers, see if they’re good, and then decide to buy or not. people will say “we don’t have time to do all this to be looking at these numbers”, and that’s totally fair. but you’re young - take the time to learn right now, make it into a good healthy habit (i stress the healthy part - everything in moderation. don’t waste your life reading 10q reports and analyzing charts), and focus on long-term outlook. 

trust your own intuition. if you’re going grocery shopping or buying a new car and seeing the exorbitant prices being charged, do you really really feel confident just blindly buying $xeqt right now? you will never perfectly timed the bottom, and that’s ok. things take time to learn, mistakes will still be made, but that’s the learning process. continue to develop that mental fortitude - losses are losses, but seeing red in your portfolio shouldn’t put you in a bad mood for the rest of the week.",1,,EdoAkaashi,0

1666565630,"there are plenty of people that advocate just selling covered calls yourself. i've been looking into it but still unsure of it all. the average joe investor on youtube has some really good videos talking about it. [good video on selling covered calls](https://youtu.be/badirk8rcfq)

my concern/confusion about selling covered calls is how can you make decent option premium/profit if the underlying price on the 100 shares of stock you own takes a nose dive over time.

for example, let's say i bought 100 shares of apple on august 11th for $17,000 when it was $170 a share (apple is now $147 a share). now i want to sell one covered call against those 100 shares i own. if i look at the option chain right now for apple, i could sell one covered call at strike price of $170 (i wouldn't want to sell a covered call below my cost basis) with expiration of nov 25th and make around $52 premium give or take. so i bought $17,000 worth of apple stock and can make $50 a month selling 1 covered call a month against it....that's not much. it's a low option premium of course because apple's stock is now worth $147 a share so a $170 strike price is very out of the money.

if apple's stock price goes even lower like let's say it goes to $130/share then i might be able to sell a covered call at a $170 strike price for $10 a month option premium maybe. the lower the price apple stock goes the lower the option premium i'll be able to collect at the $170 strike price or higher. so selling covered calls and earning decent option premium seems to me like it's all predicated on being lucky with the stock price staying around the price you paid for it or going higher that way you can keep selling covered calls at the money (atm) or out of the money (otm). as soon as the price of the stock takes a dive you won't be able to collect much option premium on your covered calls if you're setting the strike price at your cost basis or higher.

maybe someone can confirm if my understanding above is correct?

at least when you buy a ccetf like qyld/ryld/xyld you're getting dividends every month even when the stock price goes down. when selling covered calls you won't make much like my example above illustrates if the stock price goes down too far below your cost basis.",2,,NittanyLion86,0

1666633189,"i have a real problem with people who either can’t or won’t accept a difference between “earning” money and “being worth” money.

zuckerberg doesn’t earn a fraction of what he is worth due to his ownership of the largest social media platform in the world. if i remember correctly, his official salary is $1 (or maybe that’s just urban legend).

this is an important distinction because you’re proposing that we take our current income based tax system and shift it to one which is value based. this worries me for a lot of reasons, not the least of which because it’s such an unstable basis to prop up the government. if everyone decides tomorrow that facebook is shit, it’s value drops to 0 and people who rely on that value (zucc) are also devalued.

by contrast, if everyone decides that i am shit, my salary remains the same and the government still makes the same amount of money off of me. the only thing they need to worry about is everyone collectively deciding the dollar is worthless, which has the same effect as people mass abandoning facebook and amazon and apple stock. 

functionally, what you’re suggesting by making corporations pay for the bulk of government spending, is to replace the relatively stable american dollar with corporate stock. the government too is now only worth what the companies are valued at, because they tax the companies based off of public perception of value. yes, this is the same process as with fiat currency like the dollar, but i trust in the stability of my income to prop up the government far more than i trust in facebook executives to keep their company at high value so the government has more to spend. 

i know it “sounds” more fair, but i think it’s a really bad idea to take the weight of the government off of the many and give it to the few. there’s already an imbalance between the few controlling the government, so if it really does exclusively exist because the wealthy prop it up then you can expect to give up on the government ever caring about the poor ever again.",0,,RightersBlok,0

for that, my ""cost"" of foreign property would be some calculated cdn value, but certainly under $100k.

then along the way i switched brokers to one that has both canadian dollar accounts and a distinct ""us dollar"" holding account.

they transferred over my holdings and some stayed in the canadian account and some got put into us dollar account.

then let's say at the new broker i sold some or all of that netflix stock in 2016 for $150,000 usd.  so at that point i have $150,000 usd in my canadian broker's us dollar account.  so do i have to report &gt;$100,000 in foreign property because it's us dollars?   even though my ""cost"" was only $50,000 usd?

and then, what if in 2017 i used the $150,000 usd to purchase microsoft stock.  so, i guess at that time i now have &gt;$100,000 cdn worth of ""foreign property""?  or did that occur in 2016?

this is an example of one stock bought, then sold all for cash, then buying more of a different one.  but in reality it's more like 10 stocks, and buying and selling wasn't all at once, but in smaller portions, on different dates.

die eu-energieminister kommen erneut zu beratungen zusammen, um details im kampf gegen die hohen strom- und gaspreise zu klären. die staats- und regierungschefs der europäischen union hatten am freitag weitere schritte beschlossen.

der ifo-geschäftsklimaindex für oktober dürfte eine weitere eintrübung der stimmungslage in den chefetagen zeigen: von reuters befragte experten rechnen mit einem rückgang des barometers um einen punkt auf 83,3 zähler. 

europas größtes softwarehaus kann steigende umsätze nicht in höhere gewinne ummünzen. der betriebsgewinn sei im dritten quartal währungsbereinigt um acht prozent auf 2,1 milliarden euro gefallen. grund hierfür seien geringere beiträge aus software-lizenzen sowie höhere ausgaben in forschung und entwicklung sowie marketing. das ergebnis je aktie sei um 36 prozent auf 1,12 euro eingebrochen. 

vier jahre nach der fusion will sich der amerikanisch-deutsche industriegase-konzern von der frankfurter börse zurückziehen und seine aktien nur noch in new york handeln lassen. der deutschen börse droht damit der verlust des wertvollsten mitglieds im leitindex dax.

umsatz und bruttomarge haben sich nach angaben des glasfaser-spezialisten im dritten quartal besser als erwartet entwickelt. die betreibserträge dürften laut adtran über den konsens-erwartungen von analysten liegen. 

die turbulenzen an den finanzmärkten haben bei der großbank im dritten quartal bremsspuren hinterlassen. der gewinn des schweizer konzerns sank im sommer um 24 prozent auf 1,73 milliarden dollar. 

mit microsoft und dem google-konzern alphabet legen zwei der vier größten us-unternehmen ihre zahlen für das abgelaufene quartal vor. die tech-giganten gelten als indikatoren dafür, wie es um die us-wirtschaft bestellt ist.

der südkoreanische investor mirae asset sagt insidern zufolge elon musk für die übernahme von twitter&lt;twtr.n&gt; rund 208 millionen dollar (300 milliarden koreanische won) zu. 

der hauptverband der deutschen bauindustrie (hdb) rechnet mit einem deutlichen rückgang des realen umsatzes im jahr 2022. ""wir halten einen realen umsatzrückgang von fünf prozent für realistisch"", sagte präsident peter hübner dem redaktionsnetzwerk deutschland (rnd).

die bank von england sieht bestrebungen der britischen regierung skeptisch, die aufseher für den finanzsektor künftig enger an die leine zu nehmen. 

die weltbank unterstützt die ukraine mit der zusätzlichen auszahlung von 500 millionen dollar.

1666680600,"i haven't really looked into baba, because i tend to avoid chinese companies due to the transparency issues as well as unreliable economic and political climate. however just skimming over baba it's balance sheet looks good but it's net income is where it still looks overvalued in my opinion. i think it's important to have a good balance sheet for risk, but fundamentally the money they make is where the long term value is.

with this in mind $baba has a p/e of about 40 whereas $meta has a p/e of just below 11. $baba also has about $50 billion of their assets listed as intangible. so i'm always sceptical of this because it's essentially nothing, hence doesn't add any real value and produces nothing, unlike cash does which you can earn passive returns on. also how exactly they came to this valuation is always pretty ambiguous. compare this to $meta which has a larger market cap but only $20 billion in intangible assets. which sounds far more responsible than $baba's $50 billion. with this in mind $meta had a p/b of 2.78 compared to $baba's 1.44. $meta is also much more consistent with their earnings and sit on a profit margin of about 23.2% for last quarter, that's with an r&amp;d expenditure of $8.69 billion. compared to $baba's 11% profit margin and $2.15 billion on r&amp;d. also look at any other metric roa, roe, roce and you'll see a similar story. $baba is well below industry average whereas $meta is multiple times above it. so when you actually look closely i would say possibly either $baba is either fairly or even still overvalued. whereas $meta is well below fair value and is been priced like it's going out of business much like netflix was not long ago but probably more so.

now why am i bullish on $meta well, everyone always points to facebook as the main bear case and its slowing decline. this fundamentally misunderstands $meta's business model. it owns more than just facebook, it also has instagram and whatsapp. facebook also captures the older demographic far better than any other platform. my mum who never really got social media now uses it all the time, so does her friends. then there's instagram which i am yet to find a young person who doesn't have one or use. people may be using tiktok but they still use it along side instagram. most people also use messenger for communication as well, even preferring it over texting. i also just heard whatsapp is been integrated with salesforce which we use at work and is also highly successful in 3rd world countries. so this all sounds good but people wonder where's the monetization though? 

well as a computer scientist that has studied machine learning. i can tell you today everything is about data, of which $meta has a shit ton of across multiple demographics and environments all centralized under $meta. this is why their advertising is so god dam profitable. do you think tiktok can or knows how to successfully advertise to a someone in their 40's? 

i can't think of anywhere that has more data that can better target anyone and everyone over almost every single market than $meta. now is the metaverse a waste of money? probably, but it honestly doesn't matter. their core business model is so solid they can afford to take risks like the metaverse. is the apple issue a problem? well it's not good, but it certainly doesn't kill them. apple is still a niche minority part of their global market and this also doesn't mean they can't target apple users, it's just harder to do so accurately. so it isn't great but again meh.

this is why i'm still bullish on $meta and believe that most of the current pricing is based on negative future and current sentiment rather than anything tangible or of substance. based on its current valuations things would have to go really wrong for it to keep falling. personally i don't see it happening. even if the recession causes a drop in global spending and cut in advertising, i believe $meta will have no problem making it through to return similar to how $appl and $msft both did after the dot-com bubble and 2008 gfc. it may be a rough next couple of years for $meta worse case scenario, but that's the thing it's already priced like it's happened. therefore there's more potential upside to $meta then downside and why in my eyes a value play. unless i missed something this is exactly what value investing looks like. just like warren buffett said, ""be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful"".",10,,Danteslittlepony,0

1666687234,"yes, if the underlying etf is going down you can lose more on the 100 shares than you make on the short call, but, if you sell the weekly calls every week no matter what the underlying does that's 5% per week x 52 weeks = 2.6x in a year for the premium. this more than compensates for the drop in the etf. download the weekly prices and multiply the close by 5% then add up the column. i do this in excel. it's much more profitable than any trading system i have ever come up with. for most profit the underlying should be above a simple trendline or moving average (20 days works just fine). if the underlying breaks below the trendline or moving average, switch to the opposite etf. 

i trade the tqqq/sqqq and, yes, you have to own the underlying or a deep in the money call, that has very low theta. this is a lot cheaper than owning the underlying etf. this is a simple vertical debit call spread. 

for example, if you buy the tqqq at 21 and sell the 21 call expiring a week away, that's 1.05 pts or $105 credited to your account. this is the same as buying the tqqq at 21-1.05 or 19.95. so, if the tqqq ends the week above 19.95 you make a profit. if it ends the week above 21 you make your full 5%. same for uptrending stocks but the premium isn't as high. 

if your account size is small you would have to buy the vertical spread. but, owning 100 shares of the tqqq costs about $2,100 now. there are many 3x etfs that have low prices. 

i used to sell calls against my aapl stock, but the weekly premium is only 2% - higher now, over 2.5%. do that 52 times and just hold the aapl and you can make a lot of money in a year. most weeks you have to buy to close your short call on friday, then sell to open the next week's call. doesn't take but a few seconds to roll the position forward.",1,,tloffman,0

it is interesting, but i am skeptical since you're forced to hold a leveraged etf. you can easily see a more than 5% move against you on a 3x during a week. i'm also skeptical of 5% return guaranteed near the money every week. how long are you holding the underlying?

&amp;#x200b;

given the ongoing pullbacks in the market and where we're at in this business cycle with rate hikes, i think this is a bad idea. buying and holding aapl at these prices could leave you with dead money for years, since the volatility premium will inevitably go away before you can break even selling ccs.",1,,Gryzzzz,0
1666690533,"&gt;someone else said it did apply even to tfsa/rrsp did but i've since seen that's incorrect.

does not. see my links and u/bluenose777 link in their comment.

&gt;however even for non-registered accounts, it seems almost impossible for a human to know this. it would need to be checked by computer daily i think.

usually no.

&gt;suppose that in 2010 i bought $50,000 usd of netflix stock. the broker at the time just had it in a canadian open (non-registered account) and converted it to some unknown canadian value.

since cost is under $100k, nothing to report on the t1135.

&gt;they transferred over my holdings and some stayed in the canadian account and some got put into us dollar account.

this doesn't make sense. nflx is a usd stock. are you taking about a cdr on the exchange exchange? holding us listed nflx on the cdn side of the account doesn't change anything. holding  the nflx cdr  is not a foreign holding.

&gt;so do i have to report &gt;$100,000 in foreign property because it's us dollars? even though my ""cost"" was only $50,000 usd?

no

&gt;what if in 2017 i used the $150,000 usd to purchase microsoft stock. so, i guess at that time i now have &gt;$100,000 cdn worth of ""foreign property""? or did that occur in 2016?

you report msft for 2017 because you cost was $100k or more.

if you are still confused, use an accountant.",1,,FelixYYZ,0

from the stock level, this means apple wants to make more revenue :) simple as that... since buying an nft using the crypto wallet, will not benefit apple at all. so think about it, why would apple even want to allow that in the first place? 

apple stock will just continue to go up and up because they are always limiting everyone to use the iaps to make revenue. simple as that!",0,,objectnyc,0

i interned at dropbox and i can attest to it being a quite relaxed environment for both interns and full time engineers. i don't know how true this is, but from what i've heard, linkedin is similar in having great wlb.

thoughts:

\- linkedin has a better long-term company outlook.

\- it's my understanding that you get msft stock at linkedin for ft. msft stock &gt;&gt;&gt; dbx stock.

\- strong preference for remote work? go dbx. know that tc differs by col though. in the midwest my ft tc offer was for 180k first year, 150k recurring.

\- 90% of interns got return offers at dbx last year, not sure what the #s are for linkedin.

\- both companies are very good and will open many doors in the future. the difference between not having dbx on my resume and having dbx has been very noticeable. i'm certain the same is true for linkedin.

\- if you want to experience a new location and have more social opportunities with interns, go with linkedin.

feel free to dm if you have other questions about dbx! congrats on both offers. 😊",4,,ashyboye,0

1666739083,"i’m gonna tag /u/hibernating_brain and /u/paulthrowaway here since they’re both very experienced in trading leveraged etf’s, and 2 of the smartest/worldliest traders here. in my time away what i’ve come back to is a market that with the move to everyday 0dte options (see post above) has created a mega casino, built on powder kegs. you’re right imo, it’s a system for institutional traders to fleece retail. if you are regularly trading options, and not consistently winning (like 80% plus type winning) this is why, premiums are so juiced that it’s a losing endeavor. i also suspect that vix is being heavily suppressed (while at the same time elevated) to keep it *pinned* or “goldilocks vix”, it’s the perfect spot for dealers to sell premium, and fuck over retail. leveraged shares i’ve heard paul talk about trading more times than i can count, find your spot(s), make your trades, gtfo.

what’s the solution? 1) stop trading 0/1dte options all together (even you /u/wiggz420 lol), or, just learn to sell premium as good as dealers. change strategies, and lean more towards selling vol than paying for it. they both have risk obv, but one is a a weapon of mass destruction (against you) and one you get to wield. 3) follow /u/hibernating_brain trade plan, swing leveraged shares and stop buying juiced premiums. if you think spx/ndx/tsla/$amzn/googl/msft/$aapl is going to go to x price, then buy shares and set a stop at an equivalence of what premium you’d pay for options. gonna drop $2k on options, then buy n shares equivalent and  ride it. i can promise you, if you buy options x% otm x days out and your underlying moves y%, you lose (in most cases) but if you’re swinging leveraged shares, you won, just less than on a big sudden move.

i’m probs crazy but /u/hibernating_brain got me thinking few weeks back thinking he laid out the master trade plan for y’all..  only trades leveraged shares, $100k blocks, stacks 3%-6% gains and walks, hmmmm…. 🧐🤔🧐 do that 1-2-3x a week, over n times a year… sounds to me like i never need to touch options again, just refine existing strategies and adjust for swinging shares.

idk, call me crazy but i’ve just been reading a lot around here and elsewhere, thinking **a lot** and have come to the realization that unless you’re consistently hitting a stupid high win rate on options, i’ll bet you a chipotle burrito you’d make money swinging shares on the same trades you lose money on trading options…",10,,Ten_K_Days,0

no… microsoft earnings were higher than expected and google failed hard. why are they being grouped together?

because their revenue from azure was 1% less? that cannot possible be why it dropped like 7%

1666740138,"$aapl is going to be the dark horse this earnings, imo. msft and googl are deeply reliant on ads and cloud services, their consumer product game is kinda comparatively weak. you got your xboxes and whatever random bullshit google threw money at this year, but they don’t have shit on aapl.

aapl’s bread and butter is consumer retail and scalping dollars on in-app purchases. and consumer retail has been unexpected strong considering how much noise is being made about macroeconomic conditions, people are out here buying shit still. 

until i stop seeing homeless people with iphones, remaining bullish as fuck.

not gonna hold any (options) positions into earnings though, probably a theta feast, but all this to say, if you were thinking about buying puts or going short on the greatest company to have ever existed, maybe don’t.

you also need to figure out how comfortable you are with the volatility. lets say you bought $10,000 of apple stock, if next couple months the value of that position drops to $9,000, would you cash out? 

first step is you can talk to an advisor or financial planner at any of the big banks, but keep in mind some of these people earn commission on money invested, this is why i suggest no matter what they tell you. go with a dollar cost averaging route.

the reason they don't give out concrete numbers about xbox is simple: it's not because it's doing well or doing badly, it's because xbox is fairly insignificant when it comes to ms as a whole. they share revenue numbers and they've been increasing. when ms shareholders look to earning reports they're not looking for page upon page of stats about xbox. nintendo's shareholders absolutely need to know this info (since gaming is the backbone of the company) and so do sony's (since gaming is their biggest sector by a significant amount at this point as others have declined).

what is interesting to note is that microsoft saw significant gains in gaming revenue in 2021 and sony did not. of course ms had a lot more ground to gain, but it's worth mentioning. gaming revenue was up 33% for xbox, only 3% for ps. yes, ps is still a larger number overall, but that kind of growth (or lack thereof) isn't great especially in a year that should have seen much higher revenues.

but regardless xbox is a small piece of the pie at msft despite the large gains in 2021. for fy2021, gaming overall was about 9% of their revenue. for reference, their server products + server cloud services make over 3x that alone. linkedin makes 2/3 of what microsoft gaming does. their cloud services also have a lot of unearned revenue that isn't even being counted right now, that has yet to be invoiced (contracts etc, which msft has a tooon of including with goverments).",17,,caninehere,0

both seem fairly similar and require me to *eventually* convert it back to usd. it's this conversion step that *i would think* is the only thing they care about and actually track.",1,,Omni-Fitness,0

1666822857,"meta was buffeted by a broad ad-spending slowdown in the third quarter, reporting a year-over-year revenue decline of 4%, while it missed wall street expectations on the bottom line as heavy metaverse investments continued to eat into earnings.

the company said its flagship facebook app had 1.984 billion daily active users on average in q3, up around 16 million from 1.968 billion the prior quarter — and, as meta’s core social media business plateaus, it’s facing stronger competition from tiktok. facebook daus had previously declined in q4 2021, by about 1 million.

for the third quarter, meta reported $27.71 billion in total revenue and net income of $4.4 billion, or $1.64 per share — down 52% year over year and below wall street expectations. the year-over-year sales drop was only its second ever as a public company, following a 1% dip in q2. analyst consensus estimates were for revenue of $27.38 billion and earnings of $1.89 per share, according to data from refinitiv. meta’s results come after q3 earnings misses at alphabet (parent of google and youtube) and snap, which both cited weakness in ad spending during the quarter.

meta said it expects to see decline in revenue for the fourth quarter, too: it projected sales of between $30 billion and $32.5 billion, which would be a drop of 3.5%-11% versus the year prior.

on the earnings miss and q4 revenue guidance, meta stock plummeted more than 18% in after-hours trading. shares are down more than 68% year to date.

“our community continues to grow and i’m pleased with the strong engagement we’re seeing driven by progress on our discovery engine and products like reels,” meta chief mark zuckerberg said in prepared remarks. “while we face near-term challenges on revenue, the fundamentals are there for a return to stronger revenue growth. we’re approaching 2023 with a focus on prioritization and efficiency that will help us navigate the current environment and emerge an even stronger company.”

instagram has more than 2 billion monthly active users and whatsapp has more than 2 billion daily users, according to zuckerberg. he said q3 revenue would have grown slightly excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates (according to meta, if exchange rates had remained constant with q3 2021, revenue for the most recent quarter would have been $1.79 billion higher).

zuckerberg said reels — the company’s short-form video copycat of tiktok — is seeing 140 billion daily views across facebook and instagram, up 50% from six months ago. reels is now on a $3 billion annual revenue run rate, he said. “we believe we’re gaining share on time spent on competitors like tiktok,” zuckerberg said.

meanwhile, meta has been spending billions on its metaverse projects, recently unveiling the high-end meta quest pro headset ($1,500), a pivot the social media giant signaled with its new name. the company also revealed that a cheaper, consumer-focused next-gen quest is coming in 2023. but meta’s reality labs, comprising its vr, ar and wearables businesses, is years away from contributing to the bottom line and has cramped overall financial results.

in q3, reality labs posted an operating loss of $3.67 billion versus a loss of $2.63 billion in the year-earlier period. revenue for the unit came in at $285 million, dropping 49% year-over-year.

“we do anticipate that reality labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year,” outgoing cfo dave wehner said in a statement. “beyond 2023, we expect to pace reality labs investments such that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income in the long run.”

on monday, meta investor brad gerstner of altimeter capital posted an open letter to zuckerberg and the company’s board, recommending meta cut its headcount by 20% and cap its metaverse investments at $5 billion annually (versus $10 billion-$15 billion currently). “meta has drifted into the land of excess — too many people, too many ideas, too little urgency,” gerstner wrote. “this lack of focus and fitness is obscured when growth is easy but deadly when growth slows and technology changes.”

in july, zuckerberg had said meta plans to “steadily reduce” headcount growth over the next year, saying that “many teams are going to shrink.”

in wehner’s 2023 guidance to investors, he said meta is “holding some teams flat in terms of headcount, shrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities. as a result, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 will be approximately in-line with third quarter 2022 levels.” wehner is stepping down as meta’s cfo next week; susan li, currently vp of finance, will take over the role on nov. 1.

i'm all about building out the core of a portfolio with etfs/mfs but it's reasonable for someone with an affinity for a certain company to want additional exposure.  

think about it this way; *lots* of people knew meta was and is poorly run. i've avoided them like the plague.  
i still own qqq, which is around 3% meta stock. so if you have a round million bucks in qqq/spy whatever you're going to have $30,000 in meta whether you like it or not.  
now, if you want to increase exposure to *well run* good companies with a long track record, wide moat, excellent management, lots of ip, etc (msft for example) you should buy that stock on top of your qqq which is 10% msft already.  

by owning qqq as a core, and also additionally owning msft, i have increased my exposure to good management, and decreased my % exposure to meta and it's narrow moat, bad management and lack of revenue diversity.

from the prestigious princeton.edu website. 
“the following references illustrate the fact that a new human embryo, the starting point for a human life, comes into existence with the formation of the one-celled zygote:



""development of the embryo begins at stage 1 when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte and together they form a zygote.""
[england, marjorie a. life before birth. 2nd ed. england: mosby-wolfe, 1996, p.31]


""human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).
""fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. this fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.""
[moore, keith l. essentials of human embryology. toronto: b.c. decker inc, 1988, p.2]


""embryo: the developing organism from the time of fertilization until significant differentiation has occurred, when the organism becomes known as a fetus.""
[cloning human beings. report and recommendations of the national bioethics advisory commission. rockville, md: gpo, 1997, appendix-2.]


""embryo: an organism in the earliest stage of development; in a man, from the time of conception to the end of the second month in the uterus.""
[dox, ida g. et al. the harper collins illustrated medical dictionary. new york: harper perennial, 1993, p. 146]


""embryo: the early developing fertilized egg that is growing into another individual of the species. in man the term 'embryo' is usually restricted to the period of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of pregnancy.""
[walters, william and singer, peter (eds.). test-tube babies. melbourne: oxford university press, 1982, p. 160]


""the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[langman, jan. medical embryology. 3rd edition. baltimore: williams and wilkins, 1975, p. 3]


""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[considine, douglas (ed.). van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943]


""i would say that among most scientists, the word 'embryo' includes the time from after fertilization...""
[dr. john eppig, senior staff scientist, jackson laboratory (bar harbor, maine) and member of the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 31]


""the development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[sadler, t.w. langman's medical embryology. 7th edition. baltimore: williams &amp; wilkins 1995, p. 3]


""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""
[jonathan van blerkom of university of colorado, expert witness on human embryology before the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 63]


""zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1]


""the chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and male pronuclei. these pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2n nucleus of the fertilized zygote. this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
[larsen, william j. human embryology. 2nd edition. new york: churchill livingstone, 1997, p. 17]


""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
[o'rahilly, ronan and m�ller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. this textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}]


""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""

in a nutshell, apple made privacy changes that materially affected facebook's business model. there is news on this going back as far as august of 2020. the changes will cost meta $10 - $12 billion in revenue this year alone. then apple just made another change that's going to take a 30% cut of the advertisements that meta does sell. this is disasterous.

1666836358,"dollar cost averaging is simply buying some type of equity over a period of time rather than all at once. it is a way to help with risk management. 

for example lets say you have $10,000 you want to invest into apple stock. 

lets say you invest all the $10,000 now when apple is trading at $150 per share. this means the avg cost of each share you purchased is $150. now lets say over the next 5 months apple drops to $130. you are now down 13.3% on your investment. 

to help mitigate a risk like this, you could dollar cost avg in, say instead of putting the $10,000 all at once you put in $2000 per month for the next 5 months.  this means for example you would of bought $2000 at $150 per share, then $2000 at $141 per share, then $2000 at 137 per share, then $2000 at $133 per share and then $2000 at 130 per share. the result is you have a much lower avg cost on your postion and it is likely to recover at a faster rate than putting it all in at once.",1,,the-underachievers,0

i've even considered it being some huge money laundry scheme. it's on that level of stupidity. i don't think it is but it does remind me of those big unexplainable fluff projects a country undertakes because they have the mafia up their ass. metaverse thus far looks like the sims of 2004 and this somehow costs them billions to achieve. what is going on in their company?

another thing that makes no sense was the shock to the meta stock yesterday after the quarter filings. _how_ was the upcoming disaster not better factored into their stock price already? how are their investors _surprised_ by this? are these analysts middle aged tech illiterate morons that can't feel how the winds blow and what works or not? oh wait...

this initiative is the largest air castle i've ever seen... it's so large it's upsetting what cash they are burning and how much they could do with it other than this insanity. at least it won't last long. it can't. i think something will happen by next year especially given the economy crunch pushing vr even farther away. this is an iniative that spawned in times when we were on a stock market rush - it simply doesn't fit in with the coming years.",6,,jugalator,0

3. austin population growth rate has already peaked.
4. retirees/old austenite's flee to try and lock in their paper capital gains on their homes. and escape the high cost of living.

austin is going to get hit with an economic hurricane next year not seen in it's history. as a combination of high tech jobs and standard 3 bubble home price appreciation in housing will give up about 30% of it's paper value. as renters cannot afford mortgages and their rents are falling, work from home, layoffs, and risk free return of 4% in treasuries discourages tech startup funding.

fed and bankers armed the population with century low interest rates and had them speculate and bid up asset prices to standard 3 deviation bubble.

and ya this is relevant to meta because its big tech names like this that can pump billions of dollars into innovation, is where the next generation of technology will emerge. im not saying meta will be the winner, so don't see how im shilling anything. im shilling technological advancement? there will eventually be another paragrim shift, no doubt. same as always and it will come with its own set of social issues.

if you only have a few case-insensitive keywords, i guess you could also define character-set macros, and use them to define regex macros:

    $b = b|b
    $c = c|c
    $d = d|d
    $e = e|e

    $x = x|x
    $y = y|y
    $z = z|z

    @function = $f$u$n$c$t$i$o$n

this seems kind of wordy, but it does at least force you to be precise.

if you needed pervasive adjustments to the character set, you could define your own wrapper with a suitable custom character type. your `alexgetbyte` would have type `alexinput -&gt; maybe (casefoldchar, alexinput)`, where `newtype casefoldchar = casefoldchar char` has a custom case-folding `eq`. (you need to define something called `alexinput`, but it can be anything containing an input stream such as a lazy `text` or `bytestring`.) unfortunately this isn’t a super well documented way of using alex.",6,,evincarofautumn,0

1666906754,"yes, you are correct. the 3x etfs have higher risk and that's why the options have higher premiums. as i have been doing this most of the year, first on aapl, and now on the 3x, i know that the premiums (extrinsic) value of the options on the 3x etfs is consistently about 5% per week, and on aapl about 2% per week.

so, if you can get the actual option prices for the past year you can put them into a spreadsheet, but i just simulated the prices by taking the closing weekly prices of aapl vs the etfs, then calculated the theoretical option price then added up the option premium column. the total premium that you collect far exceeds any drop in the underlying stock or etf even when that stock or etf is trending down. now, hedge your stock or etf position with a 80  or 90 delta put and you have reduced the risk of the underlying to almost zero, then, you can safely sell the weekly options over and over again.

so, let's think about theta in this example. the underlying has no theta, no premium decay. the long in the money long dated put has a minor amount of theta, but the weekly call that you are selling has a lot of theta. just take a look at any option chain with the greeks and you'll see what i am talking about. also, do the spreadsheet on your own.

i didn't really ""get"" this either until i began calculating the option premium as a percent of the underlying. there is a lot of discussion about implied volatility, the greeks, and intrinsic and extrinsic values of the options, but where do you see the simple math of just dividing the premium (extrinsic value) by the price of the underlying? i wrote a simple indicator that does this (in tradestation) that i can see tick by tick on my screen, so i can see the value change over time. it's always at least 5% on the 3x etfs with one week to expire, and the premium starts to decay slowly, then exponentially drops as the option nears expiration friday afternoon. option premiums decay at a remarkable rate as they approach expiration and the idea is to capture that with minimum risk - which is why i am hedged and suggesting this be done in a hedged position.

one of the most common ways that long term investors hedge their positions (that they don't want to sell because of tax consequences) is to buy a high delta put against their stock when they believe the market is going down, then they are mostly hedged. but, the third part of this is to then start selling weekly options against that position.

back to aapl - there are a lot of very long term holders in aapl. so, keep your aapl stock, buy a leap or other long dated put on aapl to hedge your position, then sell the weekly calls at 2% per week premium. you may have to roll that position forward every friday to avoid assignment, but that's easy to do. i do it every friday. just takes a few minutes. i try to buy back the short call at the bid, then sell to open next weeks call at the ask. after a few price adjustments i always get filled.",1,,tloffman,0

throwaway because. 

as many of you know, facebook is owned by a company called meta. 

today, meta stock fell 24%. in september 2021, it was $376. now, it's $98.

since march, when it was $220 and my husband had $90k invested in it, i've been urging him to sell all his shares. at the time, my friend from college was telling me that her husband (who worked at facebook) and many of his coworkers were looking for new jobs because none of them believed in the metaverse and thought it was the stupidest idea ever. 

when i (43f) married my husband (34m) in 2014, we agreed that we would share finances and make financial decisions together. but we still both managed our own investment accounts (that we had before marriage) separately. 

when facebook went even lower (to $125) he doubled down and bought even more stock. i didn't think that i had a right to say much, because technically a lot of the money was from his own ira account, and i'm not much of a stock person. we both have similar incomes, but he's younger and has more earning potential. 

we were both working from home today, and i could see him panicking as meta stock went down by 24%. he saw me shopping on amazon and asked me what i was doing. i told him that i found a lululemon belt bag ($60) for me, and leggings from city threads ($13 on sale from $20) for our daughter to wear underneath her halloween costume. the lululemon item is rated 5 stars with 1476 reviews. the city threads item has 4.5 stars and 3721 ratings. a friend of mine who has a son with sensory issues says that he will only wear city threads for underwear, so i'm guessing the leggings are good too. 

my husband responded that i should be more ""responsible at a time like this."" exasperated, i yelled, ""you need to curb *your* spending, not me! i told you so many times to sell facebook, and this $70 isn't gonna make a dent in your losses!"" 

i went ahead and ordered both items. (i needed to order the leggings fast to get them before halloween). he stomped off and left the house, then texted me that he was staying at his brother's apartment tonight.

1666913968,"that's not the issue. the issue is those margins are shrinking *fast* — and will continue to shrink — unless their vr bets start paying off. the issue there is that their own adoption claims have been wildly inaccurate, so best case (if the metaverse doesn't happen): they cancel all their vr stuff, fire a bunch of people, and just stick to ads until all the users are gone. and who'd want to buy into a business that might just suddenly pivot and then fall flat on its face again?

so if you're a speculative investor (buying into a longer term vision), this seems like a really crappy business to buy into. but sure, if you're buying into fundamentals (a dubious strategy with non-dividend stocks) then maybe it's not that bad.

my position is this: you're buying shares in zuck. if you think he's a megabrain super genius that has some special privileged view of the future, go for it — load up on $meta. personally, i think he's a mediocre dropout who fell ass-backwards into a profitable (but largely unoriginal idea) and everyone assumed he's mega smart. he isn't. he hired some decent mbas who made good decisions and bought out some competitors, but that's it. so there's zero reason for me to believe he's on the money with this one.",5,,ugh_this_sucks__,0

i verified that the data pull was correct and mapping off our example, after 5/10/2022, some agents did not have a new case manager assigned because some advisors were doing hybrid jobs, counting as case managers, even though they were never assigned the role in the system.  that said, i attempted the existing formula with the modifications we discussed. ifna gave spill error, iferror gave value 0, and isblank did give advisor! (don't celebrate too fast, keep reading)

### the modified formula: 

=if(isblank(index($q:$v,sumifs($q:$q,$r:$r,b6,$t:$t,""&lt;=""&amp;d6,$v:$v,""&gt;=""&amp;d6),3)),e6)

1666924155,"why? investors eagerly buy into ipos in the full knowledge that the principals who are taking their private company public will likely retain control for many years; they (the new investors) just want to get in on what they perceive as an opportunity to massively leverage the founders' many years of earlier work and hard-learned skills to their own financial advantage.

anyone contemplating an ipo should be happy to leave control in the hands of those who have built it up from nothing, because they know its strengths and weaknesses better than anybody else, and they best understand what the exponential infusion of capital that an ipo provides can do for its business prospects.

 i remind you that less than a year ago, meta stock represented a *tenfold increase in value* to any investor who got in on facebook's $38 ipo in 2012 (or even *more* if they jumped in shortly after, when it sank to $20). i think a profit of *900% in less than nine years* is more than adequate compensation for the risk inherent in buying into a dicey corporate dual-share structure.

1666924775,"first. it's funny your posts in this thread are nothing but pissed off. i think you lost on meta and are crying about not sharing zuckerberg's vision. you probably had 90% of your portfolio in meta at $300ish. it's not a big deal for you though because you most likely only have about 4 shares anyway. 

second. from your posts it's apparent you are totally clueless about the metaverse - which you obviously don't understand. you keep thinking it's having an avatar represent you in a meeting or buy stocks for you. do some research because watching your hero cramer on tv isn't research.

third. you are a joke with you 6 month old account. i read each and every post you've made in this sub - it only took four minutes. you seem like a pompous, unimportant little man in the world that saw r/wallstreetbets on (again) your hero cramers show and thought, ""wow, i want to be a part of that!"" so, here you are - showing the world that you are just a shallow and ignorant little person.

four. there will be a metaverse eventually. it's not just zuck. it's success will be a collaborative effort by almost every major tech company.  zuckerberg is acting the pioneer of the metaverse currently and dumping an uncomfortable amount of resources into it's development. by uncomfortable i mean investors/stockholders are getting uncomfortable, but it won't matter unless zuckerberg gets uncomfortable. if he gets uncomfortable then that means he's lost his vision, then you'll see it fall even more.

five. $meta fundamentals are solid.  an increasing user base, positive cash flow, lots of cash on the books, less than 10.75 pe. yeah, it missed but i think it's also down due to sympathy from other social platforms. i think it's cheap now that it lost 25% of its value in 2 days. 77% of stock owned by institutions  too, which means $meta is basically in most retirement funds in the us. the more i look, the more like it. i think i will probably buy some calls on monday.

1666930391,"jim cramer chokes up as he apologizes for pushing meta stock: ‘i screwed up!’

jim cramer appeared to choke up during thursday’s broadcast of cnbc’s “squawk on the street” as the investor apologized to viewers for previously recommending they buy shares of meta — which tumbled to their lowest levels in six years.  
“let me say this,” a somber cramer told the cnbc co-panelists in a clip that went viral on twitter, addressing a thursday rout in meta shares that sent them plunging 25% in a single trading session.  
“i made a mistake here,” cramer said, his voice halting and trembling as he spoke. “i was wrong.”  
in june, cramer told his cnbc viewers that they ought to buy meta stock because its ceo, mark zuckerberg, was “simply unstoppable.” cramer touted the future of the metaverse, which is “a cool place to go.”  
the cnbc segment from june 23 even included a metaverse avatar of cramer and other network panelists.  
cramer appeared to be taken by zuckerberg, gushing: “mark knows i like to garden, i watched a garden” using the virtual reality headset that is used to access the metaverse.  


but the plummeting stock price forced the host to change his tune on thursday.  
“i trusted this management team,” said a dejected cramer, who was wearing a pained expression on his face as he unpacked his bad read on the company.  
cramer said that putting his faith in the current management team at meta was “ill-advised.” he added that he was surprised that the company didn’t exercise more “discipline” in its spending.  
cramer said he was particularly taken aback that meta burned through its cash reserves in order to invest in the metaverse.  
“i had thought there’d be an understanding that you just can’t spend and spend right through your free cash flow, that there had to be some level of discipline,” cramer said.  
when host david faber asked cramer what he got wrong, cramer replied: “what did i get wrong?” he said, visibly choking up.  
“i trusted them, not myself. for that i regret. i’ve been in this business for 40 years, and i did a bad job. i’m not proud.”  


the post has sought comment from meta.  
as of 3 p.m. eastern time, shares of meta were down more than 25%. they were trading at just above $97 a share — the lowest since 2016.  
meta announced on wednesday that revenue dropped for the second consecutive quarter as the company struggles with falling advertising sales due to stiff competition from rising social media app tiktok.  
the menlo park, calif.-company earned $4.4 billion, or $1.64 per share, in the three-month period that ended sept. 30. that’s down 52% from, $9.19 billion, or $3.22 per share, in the same period a year earlier.  
revenue fell 4% to $27.71 billion from $29.01 billion, slightly higher than the $27.4 billion that analysts had predicted.

cramer has gained a reputation online as an untrustworthy prognosticator of the stock market as twitter and reddit trolls have frequently trended the term “inverse cramer” — the idea being that investors should do the opposite of whatever the cnbc personality recommends.  
one fund manager, tuttle capital management, has taken the concept further, filing prospectuses for two cramer-tracking funds — the “inverse cramer etf” and the “long cramer,” according to nasdaq.",11,,SPCEMember593,0

1666931424,"a lot of the time these sorts of threads really do break the stated rules, and the mods on reddit tend to be unwavering when it comes to enforcement of rules, even when something is very important and relevant to a topic.  i'm guessing the kyle rittenhouse was deleted because it doesn't strictly have to do with politics (it's not about a bill being passed or a politician saying something), even though it *does* have something to do with politics in a much more emotional way.  in other words, i don't think they're usually politically motivated censoring, just literally reddit mods being reddit mods.  reddit mods have done this shit in even non-political contexts for as long as i've been here, and reddit leans left (despite what people always claim here), and i think that applies to the mods too.  

that said, don't know what the deal is here.  this subreddit has social media news all the time (top link is about meta).  one of the largest social media companies getting new ownership seems pretty on-topic to me.   my guess is that this is still recent news, and maybe the reddit algo like sto promote only one or two major stories from a major sub at a time.  the three biggest stories right now on this subreddit are about meta stock having a massive decline, meta criticizing apple, and cp being posted on only fans.  not surprising they're taking up the attention.

i'm guessing by tomorrow morning we'll see an ""elon musk buys twitter"" thread on top of this subreddit, whether it's this thread or not.  the reddit algo be weird sometimes.  i doubt it's deliberate censorship, because i don't really see why anyone would benefit from this news being censored...?  like, does elon not want people to know he bought twitter?  do anti-elon people not want people to know he bought twitter?  i don't get that logic.  the news itself is pretty neutral, regardless of how you feel about it.  it's not a conspiracy theory...just a fact.",3,,sje46,0

1666941696,"many years ago i subscribed to investors business daily. i saved them for reference. then, looked at an issue from a year prior, wrote down all the key stats from the stocks, then compared the stats to the current issue. i ran a stat program on the data and found that the only thing that worked to predict future price change was momentum. 

all of the fundemental data had no statistical correlation whatsoever with the subsequent 1 year price change, but, the one statistic that did work was the prior 1 year price change. in other words, if a stock had been gaining in the year prior it was likely to keep gaining moving forward a year. 

the reason why is obvious. good companies that are growing tend to keep growing, and poor companies that are not growing tend to have stocks that are not going up. also, the faster the growth rate, which is common in smaller companies, the faster the subsequent stock price growth. unfortunately, most of this growth tends to be already in the stock price, so stocks can get ""ahead of themselves"". but, on the average, momentum works. i later did research that showed that the best time period to use to forecast future price gain was the last 1/2 year, or 125 trading days. the highest gainers had the strongest stock performance over the previous 125 trading days. 

i bought msft stock just after it went ipo, then kept selling it after listening to the pundits on wall street week who said that its growth rate coudn't keep up and that the stock was overpriced. big mistake. msft keep growing and the stock kept going up. microsoft had incredible momentum. so did dell, which i also sold. finally i stopped watching wsw and started making money. momentum works.",2,,tloffman,0

**aita for buying nice clothes while my husband's facebook investment crashes?**

throwaway because. 

as many of you know, facebook is owned by a company called meta. 

today, meta stock fell 24%. in september 2021, it was $376. now, it's $98.

since march, when it was $220 and my husband had $90k invested in it, i've been urging him to sell all his shares. at the time, my friend from college was telling me that her husband (who worked at facebook) and many of his coworkers were looking for new jobs because none of them believed in the metaverse and thought it was the stupidest idea ever. 

when i (43f) married my husband (34m) in 2014, we agreed that we would share finances and make financial decisions together. but we still both managed our own investment accounts (that we had before marriage) separately. 

when facebook went even lower (to $125) he doubled down and bought even more stock. i didn't think that i had a right to say much, because technically a lot of the money was from his own ira account, and i'm not much of a stock person. we both have similar incomes, but he's younger and has more earning potential. 

we were both working from home today, and i could see him panicking as meta stock went down by 24%. he saw me shopping on amazon and asked me what i was doing. i told him that i found a lululemon belt bag ($60) for me, and leggings from city threads ($13 on sale from $20) for our daughter to wear underneath her halloween costume. the lululemon item is rated 5 stars with 1476 reviews. the city threads item has 4.5 stars and 3721 ratings. a friend of mine who has a son with sensory issues says that he will only wear city threads for underwear, so i'm guessing the leggings are good too. 

my husband responded that i should be more ""responsible at a time like this."" exasperated, i yelled, ""you need to curb *your* spending, not me! i told you so many times to sell facebook, and this $70 isn't gonna make a dent in your losses!"" 

i went ahead and ordered both items. (i needed to order the leggings fast to get them before halloween). he stomped off and left the house, then texted me that he was staying at his brother's apartment tonight.

aita reddit? i want to be supportive, but this is too much. he's never tried to regulate my amazon clothes purchases before. i'm a smart shopper and i did a lot of research on these items before i bought them. when we made joint financial decisions, it's been for things like appliances, vehicles, vacation budget, etc. not clothes.

in general i agree. however if people weren't bombarded with bots, people are verified etc.

cancel culture will take care of itself good/bad.

build a better platform that gives people legitimate control of what they see instead of ad driven, bot manipulated bs.

facebook as a way to keep in touch with friends etc was a great idea. what it became by design was a terrible thing.

i do have good news for you though.

meta stock is blowing up because of how terrible and over valued it was.

i dunno how much stock zuckerberg still owns, but even after his sales, it's enough to be in charge.

he'll always be rich. but because meta shit the bed he's lost upwards of 100 billion in net worth the past year.

i have no personal feelings about it, but from an investor perspective i never saw the real value in meta.

now everyone else is getting the news.

my point is this.

if they can use technology to stop the crap aspects of social media, and add some easy features to stay connected and interact with people you want, without some bs ad supported model... i think it's a step in the right direction.

that's elon's plan. it'll sink or swim on its own.

i can't think of anyone better to do it.

he wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't possible.

plus no shareholders to please.

1666969237,"""meta stock is declining because people are not using meta's family of apps""

nobody's saying that people aren't using their apps. but it is clear that the growth has slowed considerably and the market is forward-looking. 

additionally, what apple did with att is significant and i think fb underplayed it until they couldn't anymore. 

the pivot to the metaverse isn't because ""we can have this great business and this to look forward to!"" it's because the company saw where things are going eventually.  i think people's initial excitement over meta was because of the former and an earnings report or two later, they realized the situation was the latter.

additionally, the company may be realizing that they have to build their own ""operating system of the future"" to get away from apple's control over their path.  the problem becomes there's nothing keeping apple or others from building their own metaverse (and again, that's even if a ""ready player one""-esque metaverse was feasible in the next decade. i'm not sure it is and i think a lot of what's been sold as ""in the near future"" in recent years is a lot further out.)

they also did this pivot at a very inopportune time. in this environment, trying to spend a fortune on something that might pay off 5-10 years down the line, the market is going to look at that in the same way that it's currently looking at some of the more speculative companies that went public in 2020. that may be a bit extreme, but the emphasis on the metaverse (again, forward-looking and the company is presenting this as their future) has entirely changed the way that the market views/values this company. 

 additionally, facebook can't buy growth - even buying a fucking gif search engine was denied.

""meta can't compete with tiktok.""

it's not that they can't compete, but what was a growth stock is having that growth *eroded* on one side by a godzilla of a company that seems to have a very strong dislike of facebook in particular and on the other side by a series of competitors - competitors who maybe wouldn't be blocked if they tried to buy a gif search engine. i think facebook wanted regulations put on social media - regulations that they would help author, of course - that would hamper smaller competitors. and they never got that. 

""the real conversion to have about meta is whether we believe that such immersive ar/vr technologies can improve to a point where mainstream will adopt it within the next 5-10 years.""

imo? no. additionally, the stock has lost several years worth of gains for this. it's back to around 2015. at this rate, there's not 5-10 years worth of runway to do this. how much stock based comp does it take to attract people to work at meta and what does that look like when the stock keeps cratering?

sheryl sandberg wouldn't have exited if she thought the metaverse would lead to a glorious future for the company. 

meta isn't going to give up on the metaverse despite letters from funds and angry shareholders but i think there's a definite possibility that if the stock keeps acting the way it has for much longer their hand could be forced somewhere between now and the finish line that they have in mind. 

""lowering because it seems like most people do not believe in meta's vision.""

it's hard for people to get excited about something that *at this point* looks like a bad wii game that will cost a lot of money to get a vr helmet for. i said yesterday on here that when i first saw horizon worlds it felt like the tech version of that scene from ""the simpsons"" episode where homer reveals the car he designed.

~~people would rather play a nearly 10 year old xbox online game that looks better and has more to do and they already have the console so they don't have to buy something new in a period with the worst inflation in 40 years.~~ 

i understand that it's early in the technology, but the company seems to have no awareness of how absolutely ridiculous it sounds in a world where gamers are used to massive dlcs to announce that people should be excited about the addition of legs for the characters.

lastly, do people really want the metaverse and being in vr helmets for hours on end? if the metaverse is a massive success 10 years from now, it's probably in sizable part because the outside world has become either ""wall-e"" or the one in ""ready player one"" where people live in shipping containers or whatever those were stacked on each other. augmented reality is more appealing but even the tam of that i think gets considerably overestimated. people have seen the reaction to google glass, meta's glasses and snap's snapticles or whatever the f they were called (edit: spectacles.)

ps: this doesn't even get into what may have been one of the worst buybacks in history (42 billion dollars apparently at an avg cost of $300) or the failure of libra (which people were also excited about at the time despite the fact that this would obviously upset regulators - which it did.)",7,,dvdmovie1,0

1666980004,"**business insider: big tech is getting wiped out in a brutal 3rd-quarter earnings season - but apple isn't. here's why.**

big tech stocks have plunged this week on the back of disappointing quarterly earnings.

apple stock was spared because the iphone maker's results beat analysts' forecasts.

the consumer-electronics giant may have been saved by its brand power and wealthy customer base.

lackluster earnings from some of america's largest technology companies have led to hundreds of billions of dollars being wiped from their market values this week.

but apple's brand power and the affluence of its customers have helped it to impress wall street and escape a similar post-report selloff, analysts said.

alphabet shares tumbled 10% on wednesday, meta's stock price plunged 25% on thursday, and amazon shares fell as much as 21% in after-hours trading on thursday. moreover, microsoft shares slumped 8% on thursday.

in contrast, apple's stock inched up 1% in premarket trading friday.

the iphone maker is also faring better than its peers on a year-to-date basis. its stock price was only down 20% as of thursday's close, while microsoft, amazon, and alphabet shares have slumped by more than 30%, netflix has tanked 50%, and meta has plummeted by about 70%.

""apple has not cracked like the other tech firms, and shows how it can be done,"" ben barringer, an equity research analyst at quilter cheviot, said in a morning note.

by and large, big tech stocks tanked this week because their earnings fell short of wall street's forecasts. investors also balked at slowing growth, excessive spending, and gloomy guidance against a darkening economic backdrop.

for example, meta and alphabet signaled that demand for digital advertising is flagging, while amazon and microsoft reported softer growth in their key cloud-computing divisions.

meta was also punished by the market for continuing to pour money into its nascent metaverse business, while amazon shareholders were spooked by a lackluster sales forecast for the holiday season.

more broadly, consumers and businesses are being squeezed by red-hot inflation and rising interest rates, which leaves them with less money to spend on goods and services.

higher rates have also boosted the yields on bonds and savings accounts, increasing their appeal to investors relative to risky stocks. downward pressure on household and enterprise spending, and the reduced appeal of equities, represent stiff headwinds for big tech stocks.

while apple faces the same challenges, it beat wall street's quarterly revenue and profit forecasts this week. that likely reflects the pricing power it wields, thanks to its strong brand and popular products, and the relative affluence of its customer base.

""apple mainly represents the segment of the economy that can afford higher prices no matter how much they have to squeeze, and this is just because they want to be classified as trendy individuals,"" naeem aslam, the chief market analyst at avatrade, said in a note.

warren buffett — whose berkshire hathaway company counts a $130 billion stake in apple as easily the most-valuable holding in its stock portfolio — has made similar points in recent years.

buffett, who famously prizes strong brands like coca-cola and kraft, touted the tech giant as ""probably the best business"" he knows in 2020. moreover, he invested $35 billion in the company after observing how obsessed people are with their iphones, and how indispensable the device is to many people's lives.

apple's powerful cachet with consumers likely helped it to navigate inflation and rising rates last quarter, and escape the big tech wipeout this week. yet it's worth noting the company expects a tough economic backdrop to weaken its revenue growth this quarter, suggesting even its resilience has limits.

1666984921,"meta spent $45 billion on stock buybacks last year at $330 a share. the stock is worth $100 today after a post-earnings crash.


meta spent about $45 billion buying back 136 million shares last year, paying around $330 a pop. its stock was trading around $100, or less than a third of that price, on thursday after a post-earnings crash, suggesting facebook's parent company massively overpaid for its own shares.

mark zuckerberg's social-media giant also repurchased another 100 million shares in the first nine months of this year at a cost of $21 billion, or around $210 a share - more than double the current stock price.

moreover, meta has spent a total of $91 billion to repurchase 377 million shares between the start of 2017 and september 30 this year, at a weighted average price of around $242 a share, a markets insider analysis of securities and exchange commission filings shows. those shares would cost under $38 billion — or nearly 60% less — to buy today at meta's current stock price.

shares of the facebook, instagram, and whatsapp owner have plunged 70% this year, slashing the company's market capitalization from about $900 billion to around $270 billion. the sell-off has been fueled by mounting doubts about zuckerberg's expensive bet on the metaverse, concerns about an advertising slowdown, and investors dumping tech stocks in favor of safer assets.



meta's stock slump has made its past repurchases look expensive. if the company could erase all of its buybacks since 2017 and conduct them at today's price instead, they would theoretically cost $53 billion less — more than one-sixth of meta's current market capitalization.

however, it's worth emphasizing that even if meta could start its buybacks today, it probably wouldn't save quite that much money. its repurchases would be constrained by the cash it has available, the trading volume of its stock, and how much buyback spending has been approved by its board. aggressive repurchases would likely boost meta stock as well, raising the company's cost per share.

still, meta may seek to capitalize on its depressed stock price, and compensate for its arguably overpriced buybacks, by ramping up repurchases now. the company is already on track to rival the 136 million shares it repurchased in 2021.

moreover, zuckerberg and his team had $42 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of september, plus board approval to spend another $18 billion on buybacks, meaning they have the money and permission needed to pounce on beaten-down meta stock.",10,,DJ-Costa,0

also, i think you're looking at p/e incorrectly - i'm pretty sure you're comparing historic earnings (p / ltm earnings). stock prices don't price in historical info, only future.

&gt;there is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and i believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (i personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). **altria ($mo) 47 p/e, clorox ($clx) 38 p/e, kraft heinz ($khc) 38 p/e, colgate-palmolive ($cl) 32 p/e, hershey ($hsy) 30 p/e, pepsico ($pep) 26 p/e**. these are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

the drop in meta stock price highlights how short-term focused investors are. it’s easy to sell, so the investment horizon is short. zuckerberg is in it for the long term, and it’s actually great to see him doing the right thing (i.e. making smart long-term bets) instead of focusing just on numbers for the next quarter. just remember what the reaction was when facebook bought instagram, and how that investment decision was ridiculed too.",6,,i-like-foods,0

1667001191,"i understand what you’re saying but with your mortgage payment, unlike renting, if something breaks, or you need fixes/renos… you have no landlord to call.  

on top of downpayment, you still need to furnish and maintain your home; lawncare, snow removal, etc.  costs of owning and operating a home are missing from the “affordable” mortgage.

the thing you’re not getting, is instead of 40% or 200k in one go for a 20 year mortgage deal… you could take 200k and invest in stocks or something and get an even better return than a house.

ie. say you invested 200k into apple stock when it was ~$50(cad)/share in summer 2018 december/january: = 4,000 shares. today would be worth ($211 cad/share right now) ~$844k …. 

you would have to pay gains if you cash that all out today vs. house has 0 capital gains (if its your primary residence). however, you still have all those costs of ownership on top your mortgage. + you need somewhere to live when you sell.
with apple stock, you also would’ve been collecting dividend (~ 0.92/ share as of august 2022) every quarter. so 4000x 0.92 (usd) so ~ $3,680 (usd) ~5k cad (you’d pay tax though) and 4 times for the year… so ~ 20k cad? 

all that being said, there’s no guarantees with investments. apple could have a scandal and it goes bankrupt next week. where as if your home exploded insurance would cover it.  although if you lost money in the market, you can claim capital loss… 

so it really boils down to why you want a home. imo, given canada/toronto’s climate, this really is not a place i’d lock myself into a 20 year + mortgage at current prices.  maybe climate changes, and our winters become super mild? but i’m not trying to make sure i’m here to pay a mortgage to shovel snow/freeze for almost 6 months/year for the next 20 years. like i wouldn’t even buy a house here if i won a couple million. i do not see what is so great about winter canada. specially after the government covid response. can’t have too many people at a funeral. politicians/dr’s saying to wear masks during sex.  get jabbed or lose my ability to fly/work… and then even dumber people agreeing with such governance.
yeah, no thanks.

the media likes to promote things that cause a reaction and sharing of the articles. their goal isn’t to inform investors or those who want to use cryptocurrency for real life use.

btc and xmr have withstood a lot more market cycles and attacks from regulators than most coins mentioned here. you can buy bitcoin and swap to monero using a few different options with easy ui/ux.

countries may ban monero or bitcoin but they can’t stop people from getting it and using it. 
they can’t stop miners and it’s difficult to censor anything.

the majority of shitcoins on this and other threads have completely different goals and functions. 
tough to compare, but i understand from an investment perspective you could compare performance— but not from a fundamentals standpoint, they’re so different. 


the value of btc and xmr isn’t solely as an investment, or to buy nfts, or land in the metaverse..  it’s for real life utility.. like actually buying things and having privacy.

edit: things you can’t actually use aren’t worth putting money into.. you could buy other commodities, instead of gamble with pos coins that are centralized and at the devs mercy. buying things you actually use means you won’t be disappointed when the value in $usd drops. goals matter. if you goal is to get rich quick, try gambling for similar results. nfa",1,,satoshishash,0

2.  cs is blaming social media for outflows which caused it to be in breach of some of it's legal requirements regarding assets.  you know, all those billionaires spending there day idling on facebook, twitter, reddit.

3. cs has floated setting up a bad bank, one which sole purpose it to hold failing assets (read shorts).  then that bank can collapse and the rest of cs survives.  i don't know if that bad bank would be a part of the dtcc mutual coverage agreements or not.

4.  in a week where cs stock price has gone down 20%, they are doing the one thing they don't want to, which is sell equity, which again further dilutes the stock price.  in addition, certain property assets and business lines are being sold off.  they received $4 billion in investment from saudi arabia.

5.  in addition to cs down 20%, you had $meta down 20%, $msft down i think %18 and $aapl is whipsawing and said to expect bad things come q1 2023.  while this was happening, it should also be noted that 5 or 6 planes, including one owned by citadel securities, the ontario teachers pension fund (worth $227 billion), two planes from geneva (unknown affiliations) and several others landed at a private runway / game reserve in spain.  citadel securities in the past has landed the plane there several times and wildly suspected they were meeting with significant finance players.

1667072295,"then i'll eli5 it (though not literal 5, because i would run very quickly into hurdles with my similes). it'll take a while, and i'll even have to section it out..

that a stock has a ""price"" is a fairytale people tell children so that they will clean their teeth and do their homework. to explain why, i need to get to basics: trading 101.

===

there are two fundamental types of order one places in order to buy or sell a stock through a stock exchange.

- limit orders, where the buyer/seller controls the price that they trade each share for, but have no control over when or if.

- market orders, that control the when and if but not the price.

brokers will offer other kinds of orders but they're fundamentally built up of market orders, limit orders, and careful timing.

the limit orders form something called an order book, a list of people willing to buy the stock (arranged in order of descending price) and a list of people willing to sell (in order of increasing price). the two lists can not overlap on a single exchange. the usa likes making things awkward so they have multiple competing , but let's not get into that - it makes everything more complicated for everyone involved. let's pretend we're in a sane world with a single exchange, a single orderbook.

when someone wants to buy now, they tell the exchange ""hey i want to buy 200 shares right now"", and the exchange takes 200 shares from the lowest price seller and swaps it for money. if they are selling less than 200 shares (say 100), then their order is filled, they're knocked out of the list, and the next lowest price seller's order is filled, and so on.

the bigger the amount you want to buy, the higher that last trade's price will be. you might be buying the stock at $100 per share at the lowest seller, but if you eat through all the lower price sellers then you could be paying more per share. 

the same happens in the opposite direction - the more you're selling, the lower the final price you're going to get. when you've made that trade, the orderbook bears the impact of what you've done - you've made the price lower for other sellers, or higher for other buyers, after you're done.

this is supply and demand in action. trading 101 as promised.

===

from the above, if i have succeeded, it is fairly clear why there's no such thing as the ""price"" of a stock. it depends on how much you're buying or selling and how quickly you want it done. the more you are trading, the worse it is for you, regardless of whether you're buying or selling.

say i'm selling a notable percentage of a company. what's going to happen if i do it all in one go as... 


--- a market order?

well, i'm going to eat deep into that order book. at one instant, there could be thousands of people fighting over price differences of a cent around the $100 dollar mark, and boom - i eat up all of the buyers down to, say, $50. suddenly the remaining buyers are stacked up at $50, and the sellers are still stacked up at $100. what happens next?

well, if left to their own devices, traders would go nuts. they'd have to eventually find an agreement on the new price, with sheer financial bloodshed on the way (people selling far too low, people buying far too high, etc), and it's almost guaranteed that it won't be a fair fight for the small guys. anyone who might have prior knowledge of the big trade will rake in astronomical profits, by swapping their orders out to be on the low end of the pile. anyone with faster responses will win out. the impact will spread much further than this one stock, too - there are huge funds that include this stock in its portfolio (e.g. the s&amp;p 500 etf) that'll see an instant value loss, their traders will panic, and start selling off other assets too. if a big enough stock and a big enough sale, it'd even likely have a (very) short term impact on the value of the dollar, the price of oil, and even the exchange rate between japanese yen and the euro. people overreact, people misjudge their algorithms, and only time and information will solve it.

what'd actually happen is that the exchange would either prevent the trade to begin with, or it would halt trading immediately after due to the aftershock effect that i've described above.

--- a limit order?

here the story is different. with such a huge limit order, anyone who had an order to sell at a higher price than me is going to realise pretty quickly that they're never going to be able to sell. they're going to have to reduce their price and get in front of me.

the buyers know that they'll do this, and will back off, taking away their high price orders and letting sellers come in with their lower prices. its less market disruption than the market order approaches, but is still price manipulation, and will end up with the rather frustrating problem that i didn't actually sell a single share. i just forced everyone else lower.

--- something else?

sure. you don't need to do it all in one go - you could market sell a small number of shares, many times, letting the market settle each time before i go again. i could make sure i'm the seller of fewer than n% of total shares sold in any given time window, by selling in small batches and waiting for other activity to recover the market. i could sell in regular time intervals, slowly but surely heading towards a known end time where i have sold everything.

this is a pretty good approach. brokers offer all kinds of strategies for executing large trades. they usually involve monitoring the market and adding a market or limit order when something happens, like a unit of time has passed, a certain number of trades have gone through the market, a price has been reached on a trade, all sorts.

---

the thing is, this logic only applies to normal traders. if i own google stock but am not a google employee or a member of the board of directors, i can buy and sell relatively freely. if i'm on the board of directors, or am an employee, i am subject to certain rules that have been agreed upon by other shareholders, and that i agreed to upon entering the role. this will usually mean i have to give preference to other big shareholders before going to the public exchanges, or it might mean i can never go to the public exchanges at all.

one big reason for this is control. the company has little interest in a hostile takeover, and giving away a large percentage of shares to just anybody will give that person voting rights within the company.

another is insider trading. how would you feel if tim cook realised apple was about to go bankrupt, and sold as many shares as possible on the public markets to clueless investors? if you're one of them, or have a pension that holds apple stock (directly or indirectly), then you'd be absolutely furious. so would many people. that's why people with important positions can't go around selling large numbers of shares - they have to follow procedure, and they have to report it to the securities and exchange commission (a.k.a. the sec, kind of like the trading police but with even less humour and much bigger jail sentences if you cross them).

anyway, that's probably enough for now. it was as pedagogical as i could make it.",3,,WhatHoPipPip,0

there's a concept in business called ""value creation"". it's actually the entire core of the business - it's the core value of the product to the customer  example, fitbit was invented when someone said ""i think people would pay for a tracker that would help them monitor their activity"", and they were right enough.

where is the value creation in the meta family today? most things that they do are  either done by someone else, done better by someone else, or unnecessary, and their core facebook brand has become toxic. if i were *given* meta stock, i'd be selling.",0,,MercuryAI,0

1667088805,"look honey....

you have selfish vibes... your worldview attitude is one of being involved with yourself.  you just focus on your career, your goals, and your fitness. 

women find this unattractive.

as far as the girls you like not reciprocating the love back... that has nothing to do with you. 

that is about them.

so people have ""types"" and nothing you can do to change it. 

some gals like nerdy guys. many gals like ""bad boys"" with tattoos, high adventure sports, and drinking problems.

for me i disliked any guy who had a government job. this was predominant in my town. most men worked for the government or a contractor. 

some men have a type. they like skinny, or busty, or dark hair.  some men crave petite women.  other men like a mommy type. i am older than my husband.  

there have been extensive studies. 

for me (a former hottie) i would discredit and deny a second date to any guy who had flashy expensive rims on his car. 

when my husband pulled up in his jalopie $500 saturn i was smitten.  he had secretly poured every penny into apple stock. no money for cars.  twenty years later we can buy any car we want.  i knew this back when dating the way to a good life was investing.

i had a roommate who only liked guys with thick fat upper arms.  she would be not turned on by anyone skinny or bony. 

so quit thinking rejection from women is about you. 
unfortunately women go for height. dumb... but this is where we are.

for me, same with bitcoin, because it's not backed by anything and doesn't have a use case that even vaguely justifies its current evaluation (other cryptos are far better as payment systems). it also doesn't inherently generate or build or create something.

1667226201,"dear /u/anestling,

do you know what has happened to nvidia stock between 1060 release and now? it has increased by 900%. revenue has increased from 7 billion in 2016 to 27 billion in 2022.

do you know what makes a business successful? making shareholders happy. nobody cares about that 6 year old chip, it's not 2016 anymore.

do you know what we have done since the gtx 20 series? we have raised the prices of our products many times over and yet we sold all of them. they sold so fast we couldn't even keep up with producing them and we have confirmed cases of individuals willing to spend $2500+ for an rtx 3080.

do you know what will happen to our market share and people's attitude? both will rise. we have no competition. intel is a giant shitfest and amd... nobody cares about amd. people are fine paying 30/40/50% more for comparable performance and our proprietary features just to get a geforce. you can use steam hardware survey and you will see every single one of our gpus being more popular than our competition. that rtx 580 has 1% marketshare and that's the best they could do, we beat that with pretty much any of our gpus regardless of the price.

as for their upcoming cards - you think anyone cares? people talk about amd hoping they will get us to bring prices down. they won't buy these cards. they just want them to exist hoping it will magically cause ours to get cheaper. it won't. we do give our competition a chance of increasing **their** prices however.

intel will quit the market soon enough so it is not an issue. nobody is willing to even give it a chance exactly because they don't have features we do. their card might even be competitive to our 3060/3060ti but we still outsell them 50:1 in that segment.

the pricing of rtx 40 series is indeed greed but we ran market analysis and figured out that people are more than willing to spend $2000 on a gpu so selling them one for $1200 is a bargain. but what are you going to do about it? buy something from the competition? they will raise their prices too, maybe just not as much.

sincerely yours, jensen huang.",15,,ziptofaf,0

over the last 21 years, apple stock has also split several times with a 2-for-1 split in 2005, a 7-1 split in 2014 and a 4-1 split in 2020.

the hypothetical investment would now be 2,857.12 shares.

based on a price of $157.37 for apple shares at the time of writing, the $1,000 investment would now be worth $449,624.97. this represents a return of 44,862.5% over the last 21+ years.

1. you're assuming the valuation is accurate
2. you're assuming the arrest asset can be sold
3. you're assuming the market can absorb the sale of the asset

in this case, the asset is meta stock. zuck owns 360 million shares. its questionable that buyers for 360 million shares could be found, and even if they could, selling so many shares would drive the price down.",0,,daemin,0

1667247418,the main problem with the meta stock is that zuckerberg seems to have 0 grasp of budgeting and is in charge. i say this as a massive meta bagholder with an enormous belief in vr / ar. it's a new technology yet reports are going around that they are paying engineers hundreds of thousands to build it. they get massive senior wages for a technology that is basically new. meta needs to cut these costs and rather hire much cheaper labor. yet zucks mission seems to be to throw away as much money as possible at engineers who are clearly not worth it.,-28,,WillyBoynka,0

the problem for meta is that they have nowhere left to grow. user growth has started to fall off and when a company enters the decline period, it tends not to turn around. meta stock won't be priced at growth stock levels either. unless mark can find another market, they're going to be ibm or ge in the coming decades.",13,,bmc2,0

the problem is they're declining. once this starts, this tends not to stop. the people invested in meta aren't going to let their money sit around in meta stock if it's not returning value to them. that means people pull money out and the stock tanks. that's what we're seeing. if the price stabilizes again, it'll be after zuck stops wasting $10b a year on vr and it'll be at a much smaller multiple than previous. this is what happened with ibm. it's what happened at ge.",3,,bmc2,0
