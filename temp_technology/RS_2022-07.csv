He owns 333 million Microsoft stocks which are valued at 268 dollars a piece. 

Golden state warriors will probably have bigger payroll than clippers at some point but just to give you some context of the wealth difference I'll say this: 

If Microsoft stock goes down 2 % Ballmer would lose 1.784 billion which is more than Joe Lacobs entire net worth of 1.5 billion. I was inspired to write this post where Lacob said that it would be impossible to have a 400-500 million dollar payroll which makes lot of sense when you take a look at the situation.

1657857037,apple stock: should investors worry about price target cuts?,"Citi: Apple Phones Last Too Long

Citi analyst Jim Suva recently cut his price target on Apple from $200 to a still-bullish $175. Suva lowered his price target due to factors such as foreign exchange headwinds and concerns that Apple's Russian exodus will hurt the company's growth.

But according to Suva, the biggest short-term concern for Apple's stock is the potential lengthening of device replacement cycles. According to reports, users now tend to go four years without upgrading their smartphones.

Combined with weaker consumer spending due to inflation, this could put negative pressure on iPhone shipments and result in fewer units sold.

However, the analyst listed five good reasons to remain bullish on Apple:

The launch of the iPhone 14 in September and the debut of a foldable phone in 2023
A product mix that deviates from lower-priced Android models
Apple's plans to buy back about $90 billion in stock
Apple's ""sticky"" service revenues
Upcoming releases such as virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) products and the Apple Car, which are not yet reflected in the company's market cap

1658081711,apple stock reddit analysis (aapl),"# AAPLE Stocks

In the last two years, Apple's share price has doubled thanks to the attention that investors have devoted to the technology sector during the restrictions adopted around the world to face the Covid-19 pandemic.

Apple was the first company to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion. It was in 2018. It was also the first US company to reach a market cap of $2 trillion and the first to reach $3 trillion (January 3, 2022).

Its shares are among the most traded assets of the last decade, both among institutional and private investors. Since the low reached as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the price of Apple shares on the stock market has experienced a [rise of 170%](https://capexinsider.com/insider-week/?orid=30023&amp;opid=84).

Investors who bought 10 shares of Apple at the time of Apple's IPO have seen the value of their investment rise from $220 to a whopping $112,268.8. Due to the spectacular rise in the price of its shares in recent years, the company decided to carry out a stock split to make investment more accessible.

In this article, we will explain if it is still interesting to buy Apple stock and how recent events are affecting its behavior. We will use technical analysis and fundamental analysis so that you have the necessary information to make the decision that best suits your needs.

https://preview.redd.it/7kw1vytf66c91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2fde0e2d9930cea50488f70d725ed911a0483c5

# Invest in Apple - Steve Jobs

The return of Apple founder Steve Jobs to the company marked a turning point. The apple company was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1997, it was then that Jobs decided to put the interests of the company before the short-term needs of the shareholders: he focused on financial sustainability and accepted a salary of 1 USD per year. Jobs made the rest of his salary dependent on Apple's performance and Apple's stock.

Jobs is considered by many to be a visionary. He flouted the rules of traditional business practices and consumption patterns and went by what he thought consumers wanted or needed. He made the technology accessible and popular with the general public and the results showed it.

He put the company on the map and created a veritable Apple cult that saw the value of Apple stock rise exponentially in a relatively short period of time.

Thus, before his death, the character of Steve Jobs was one of the hidden arguments to buy Apple shares.

# Why buying Apple stock?

If Apple was successful again from the 2000s and 2010s, it's largely due to the iPhone and iPad. These products have somehow revolutionized technological mobility. What sets these products apart from the competition is that they are authentic and add value to the consumer.

They have the particularity of being multifunctional despite the high prices. With them you can do many things, such as listening to music, watching videos, reading digital books, playing video games, surfing the Internet, watching TV, etc. In short, the iPhone and iPad allow you to potentially save on some purchases.

Apple's other strength for generating repeat business and retaining customers is its portfolio of services through iTunes for music and the App Store for free and paid apps.

Now that the iPhone and iPad have reached maturity and democratization, it will be necessary to find other arguments to buy Apple shares on the stock market since they are very dependent on the success of their products.

China and the services sector could provide a new impetus. However, in China, the Apple brand faces local competition from Xiaomi, Huawei and ZTE.

# Apple Results 2021

Apple recently announced financial results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2021 (June 26 ‚Äì September 25).

The most relevant data is the following:

* ‚úÖ Apple has entered during this period 83,360 million dollars (71,493 million euros), 28.84% more year-on-year. Nearly half of the revenue, 46.6%, comes from iPhone sales.
* ‚ùå Despite the improvement in results, Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out that they are below what they expected as global supply problems have negatively impacted the accounts, specifically 6 billion dollars less.
* ‚úÖ Regarding the quarterly Earnings per Share (EPS) it reached 1.24 USD per title.
* ‚úÖ Regarding the dividend, Apple's board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.22 per share that was paid on November 11, 2021 to shareholders.

# Long-term Apple stock analysis

Let's analyze the following chart of Apple stock to determine where the current situation is and if it is a [good time to invest](https://capexinsider.com/insider-week/?orid=30023&amp;opid=84).

https://preview.redd.it/8q9vdwhp56c91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=930c9bd8b545cd1baf45b8771b6e905dd17c9e54

Apple's stock price has seen an extraordinary stock market performance since its lowest low in March 2009, with highs regularly being broken higher.

Let's take a deeper look at 2020 and so far in 2021. Apple's stock reached an all-time high in February 2020, at $82. Nothing suggested that it could change the upward trend, at least in the short term.

However, in the following month, Apple shares fell by around 35%. What happened? It can be summed up in one word: coronavirus.

The share price, however, has recovered dramatically, rising by more than 170%. This increase is due to different events:

* ‚úÖ Good economic performance
* ‚úÖ Apple has become the first US company to reach a market capitalization of 2 trillion dollars
* ‚úÖ Apple stock split 4:1

We can see how the share price begins an almost vertical upward rally from the end of March 2020, after the crash caused by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, until August. In that time Apple is revalued from 62 dollars to 121 dollars.

The stock resumes its trend in September and enters a bullish channel with setbacks and bounces at various Fibonacci levels until finally bouncing at the 61.8 level (around $142). How much is an Apple share worth now? $161 as of November 26, 2021.

Let's zoom in a bit more on the graph:

https://preview.redd.it/6d9ukh6r56c91.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53a0dec84c23a889e469faa06ad04b292a8a748b

In the graph above we can see the different levels that the price of Apple shares has been exceeding and the point where it is. If we look at the Moving Averages (20, 50, 100) we can see how all three lines are bullish and continue below the price.

# Apple Stock Split

At the end of the summer of 2020, Apple announced the split of its shares of 4 for 1. What does this mean and what is it due to?

Apple is looking for new investors and the price that the stock reached before carrying out the split was around 500 dollars.

On August 31, 2020:

&gt;‚û§ The price of each Apple share was divided by 4 . That is, the new shares began to trade around 120 dollars. This serves to attract new investors by being a more affordable price.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚û§ On the other hand, those who had bought Apple shares were not affected, since even if the price is divided by 4, the number of their shares is multiplied by 4, so the total amount remains the same.

By lowering the share price, it is easier to broaden the investor base. This benefits the company's liquidity and creates more demand for its shares.

So, can we say that it was a good time to invest in Apple? Only with the announcement of the split, the shares increased their value.

In addition, now the price of these is much more accessible.

Let's look at the situation that has surrounded the company in recent years to determine if it is a good time to invest in Apple.

# Apple financial analysis

Apple's financial ratios speak for themselves. The ROE (Return on equity), that is, the return on shareholders' money, as of September 30, 2021 stands at 144.12%. As for Earnings per Share (EPS), it has been growing fiscal year after fiscal year, as we can see in the following chart:

[Data corresponds to each Apple fiscal year \(ending September 30\). Please note that past results are not a reliable indicator of future results. ](https://preview.redd.it/1cjebmkz56c91.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89242c0249283ca1ea6f47f272d00541ceabace7)

Right now, Apple is making [significant profits](https://capexinsider.com/insider-week/?orid=30023&amp;opid=84) and keeping Earnings Per Share (EPS) on an almost continuous upward trend, especially since 2016. This is good for shareholder value creation and your cash flow.

Let's see then the distribution of Apple's dividends:

https://preview.redd.it/pk6tve1766c91.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ebd998ff8309d365e86dd19d61b53252ffb20e

Since 2012, the company has been paying a dividend per share to shareholders and is committed to a financial rationale that Wall Street loves.

The dividend increases each year. This is proof that Apple is capable of creating shareholder value. It has room to be more generous with its shareholders.

At first glance, its dividend can be considered solid in the long run.

# Investing in Apple?

You may be wondering if investing or buying Apple stock right now would be a good idea. Let's summarize what we have explained above.

In terms of fundamental analysis, Apple is a long-term, high-quality company with a cash flow of more than $250 billion and enviable profitability in the technology sector.

In addition, it has the financial flexibility to work on other growth drivers to create shareholder value.

With the split of its shares, the title has become much more accessible to all investors, which can be interpreted as a positive sign.

As we can see, the price was in a very pronounced uptrend. This suggested a further correction in the price is likely to happen, a moment that has not yet arrived.

1658119803,does a bios update reset settings? are saved settings good for a bios v.n+1? prime z690-p d4.,"I just got a machine built on Prime Z690-P D4. It seems that BIOS updates for it are coming out quite often, about every other month. I have set quite a few settings differently from the ""optimized defaults,"" which I loaded to begin with. I have also saved intermediate and final settings as I went, through into the 2 of 8 setting save slots, alternating between the two. I have an option to export these to a USB stick, but will they be useful after an upgrade I have no idea. 

What is the general experience with the settings persistence on this, or similar enough ASUS motherboards? Not even a month back, when I flashed a ""minor security update"" on a 6-year old build with another brand mobo, literally the next version after the one I had, all settings had gone to clean slate, including cleaned setting save slots (and after such a thorough erasure, I would not dare to apply a settings file from a thumb drive, even if had them backed up, as it possibly had been done for a reason). On the other hand, this has never been an issue on my notebooks or brand-name desktops, although these don't have such a smorgasbord of options as do mobos for custom builds. So this happens either way, and, I guess, depends on the brand. And I don't remember having an ASUS in the last 10 years...

So, should I expect that customizations would survive a BIOS upgrade? Can I use setting saved by one BIOS version in the next one? If yes and yes, is it then OK to skip an upgrade if I have no problems with the machine, and still more or less expect that my setting will survive in v.N+2? What if a couple of upgrades? Likely, you already understand the fuzzy scope of the question and my expectations from an answer. It's never a clear cut yes/no, a data loss is always a possibility during just any upgrade.

But finding a great business at a reasonable price is a necessary next step if you want great returns.  Apple is currently trading at a relatively high multiple, but don't expect that the price won't come into striking range soon.  Apple has doubled both their profits and free cash flow in the last five years, and growth is still expected from this tech giant.  Just be careful at current prices - $104 per share may be a much better price.

DAX Bounces Off A Crucial Support To Enter Bear Market Territory

  


  
According to CoinDesk‚Äôs Bitcoin Price Index, bitcoin is down 9 percent in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $9,500. Since it tested $9,700 yesterday, bitcoin has shed almost $500 on low volume. As mentioned in our earlier analysis, despite the recent decline, bitcoin is still up more than 15 percent in the last seven days.

  


  
As per the daily chart, the technical structure of bitcoin is currently at the midway mark of a falling wedge with the lower end at $9,400 and the upper end at $9,700.

  


  
Although the price has already entered below the midpoint of the wedge, the break has not triggered a bounce from the lower end of the triangle and bitcoin is currently testing a key support of $9,200.

  


  
If bitcoin is to rise above $9,300, a crucial psychological level, the bulls will have to overcome resistance at $9,",1,0,Nice-Armadillo-3992,u_Nice-Armadillo-3992

Opening Bell: Stocks Extend Selloff As Investors Hide In Safety

  


  
Stocks were sharply lower Tuesday, capping the best two-day performance in three weeks. In a day of big losses for stocks, Wall Street's major indexes finished well off their session lows as traders sought safe havens.

  


  
The Dow fell 144 points, or 1 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite was off 1.8 percent.

  


  
All three indexes were down more than 2 percent in the final minutes of the trading day, a rare occurrence as the market is closed for Good Friday.

  


  
The S&amp;P 500 is now down 4.2 percent from a record high of 2,048.96 it hit a month ago. Investors are trying to decide whether stocks are nearing a bottom, though they expect the market to pull back further in the months ahead.

Investors On The Ropes

  


  
This week in the blogosphere was pretty depressing. The New York Times ran a feature on the so-called ‚Äúbaby bust‚Äù in which parents were opting for fewer, not more, children. The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Dorothy Rabinowitz warned that the decline in family size would leave Americans with a generation of latchkey children whose moral development was severely stunted. The cover of Bloomberg Businessweek featured the face of an angry woman with the bold headline ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be a Wuss ‚Äî Have More Kids‚Äù. (We have more in common with Dorothy Rabinowitz and Bloomberg Businessweek than we‚Äôd like to admit.)

  


  
It is true that there is a cultural bias toward small families, but it is not a bias that is necessarily rooted in economic insecurity. In fact, it‚Äôs more of a psychological or emotional shift. It‚Äôs a trend that we don‚Äôt particularly endorse, but we can appreciate its motivation. It‚Äôs not based on",1,0,Latter-Ad2276,u_Latter-Ad2276

1658947645,pelosi‚Äôs husband sells $4 million worth of nvidia stock at a major loss (one day before congress set to pass ‚Äúchips-plus‚Äù bill),,87,26,XIIXOO,Conservative
1658948262,nancy pelosi's husband dumps nvidia stock as house eyes chip bill,"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband sold his shares of chipmaker Nvidia on Tuesday, days before the House is expected to consider legislation providing subsidies and tax credits worth over $70 billion to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry.

In a periodic transaction report, the senior Democrat disclosed that her husband, financier Paul Pelosi, sold 25,000 shares of Nvidia for about $4.1 million, ending up with a loss of $341,365.

Paul Pelosi frequently trades shares of companies popular with many investors, including Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies.

Transaction reports filed by Pelosi, a multi-millionaire, show her husband bought 5,000 Nvidia shares in July 2021, and that he exercised options to buy another 20,000 Nvidia shares last June.

The Senate is expected to vote on final passage in coming days of legislation providing about $52 billion in government subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, as well as an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.

The legislation, which aims to make the domestic chip industry more competitive with China's, would then be taken up in the U.S. House under Pelosi's direction.

Last year, Pelosi defended the rights of federal lawmakers to trade stocks, but she later responded to calls for a ban on trading by lawmakers by signaling willingness to potentially advance such legislation.

A 2012 law makes it illegal for lawmakers to use information from their work in Congress for their personal gain. The law requires them to disclose stock transactions by themselves or family members within 45 days.

An analysis by Unusual Whales, a service selling financial data, concluded that congressional lawmakers last year traded $290 million in stocks, options, cryptocurrency and other assets, and that they outperformed the market, on average.
