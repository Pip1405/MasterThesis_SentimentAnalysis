The stock recently pushed up above its 20 day moving average, and this could be a good sign for a reversal of the recent downward trend.  Buyers are likely to fill demand around the $135 price level, so watch the stock to potentially rebound around these levels before continuing upward.

1654364516,18 insiders have sold aapl stock over the past 6 months,"I have been investing in Triple leveraged ETF's for some time, my investment strategy is very simple to watch the corporate insider moves and super investors buys and sells and adjust my portfolio accordingly. Why do I do this? 1) Because it works 2) I have a sneaky suspicion insider orgs/corporates know something we don't

&amp;#x200B;

 A large # of institutional investors sold Apple much earlier in the year. Had we followed along in Feb and sat on the sidelines we would be sitting pretty good on the sidelines.

&amp;#x200B;

I always check every month for any updates to the corporate/insider buys and apply the same logic to the leveraged ETF.

What's the downside? Ofcourse this isn't a 100% win rate strategy but if we can time our exits with these investors we can avoid losing a huge part of our portfolio. Buy and hold still beats this strategy by a decent amount but we wouldn't be down **64%** like the underlying ETF.

We have the benefit of hindsight but i don't plan on buying PRO Leveraged ETF's until we start seeing some institutional investor buys and even then ill DCA. For now the plan is the DCA buy shorting QQQ.",14,10,SpamSteal,TQQQ

I'm a very casual player with my friend, and we find v-stock a necessity for being able to aim easily and enjoy the game. That said, it sucks when you want to be able to hip fire and blind fire.

So can we please get the ability to bind a key to toggle the v-stock on/off at will without going into the settings menu? That would be perfection for me!
