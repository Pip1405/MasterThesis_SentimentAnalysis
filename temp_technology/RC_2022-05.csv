for all the ""iamverysmart"" posters here i'm genuinely curious--have you actually invested money over a long period of time? how has it turned out for you? way too many people here want to simply get rich quick by crypto, and without a doubt if you made the right moves, it was totally possible. but the same holds true for $gme, $tsla, $aapl, $msft, and any stock going years back. not everyone can be that lucky. there's a reason buffett won the challenge against hedge funds and it goes to show that long term investments in etfs are super successful. it's not 2839442% growth, but hey, it works for everyone.

personally, i think of the big tech maybe $goog is the more reasonable one at this time, because it's less aggressively priced than $aapl or $msft or $amzn even if it's growing faster or at the same pace. and the moat is definitley there, and arguably stronger than other on the list.

[$100 is a small price to pay for the lesson you got, but you're not learning it.  fubo is losing money.  fubo operates in a an oversaturated market with many competitors.  where is fubo's competitive advantage?  how do they drive future revenue to even justify the current valuation, let alone the pie in the sky number you bought in at?  what is their cash position like?  i won't comment on fubo's viability, because i have no idea what the answer to any of those questions is, but as an investor, you should.](/r/stocks/comments/uffqbg/internal_nasdaq_damage_more_than_45_of_stocks/i6u02vw/)

[oh common, it's always easy to judge on someone's play, which i respectfully refuse to hear your opinion, but i already make enough profits just from fubo's short selling in other brokerage (between 20-15), so i dont need to pay any prices here, but rather i get paid to do short on other growth stocks including but not limited to fubo.   majority of ark and small cap growth have negative eps meaning they dont make any profits and therefore can only be viable in low interest rates.   all small growth companies initially starts from red ocean so if it doesnt survive, it's fine. if it survives, it's fine either. i didnt put my money at fubo as an investor, but simply just trade for small earning play, which is fine.   i wouldnt be surprised if fubo goes things in the past or merge with dis or any other gigantic big tech that have enough dry powders to simply buy out fubo in 1/10th of price compared to 12 months ago.   either way, i dont care if it survives or not, but it will be there just to take a look and see how it will go.](/r/stocks/comments/uffqbg/internal_nasdaq_damage_more_than_45_of_stocks/i6u52us/)

[you're basically just pulling numbers out of hat. the situation in late 2018 was different than today. arguably the economic backdrop today is worse, but then again a lot of nasdaq stocks have already been hit significantly harder than in late 2018. most tech stocks are trading significantly below the valuations they hit going into 2019 at this point.  i can't help but feel the nasdaq is really going to struggle to fall much lower. for example i've been running numbers on amzn and how i run them it looks unbelievably undervalued at this point. you basically have to assume that their ecommerce segment will continue to drag on the business for years. same with fb and nflx. i don't think they're great businesses, but they are significantly undervalued in my opinion.  then there are the quality quality growth stocks like shop which are now trading at their lowest valuation in like 7 years despite now being profitable and being far less risky than they were in say 2016 because of their scale and maturity.  it's even getting hard to argue trash ""growth"" stocks like hood or tdoc should fall more. i'm not saying they couldn't fall more if their businesses continue to struggle, but they're certainly not expensive at this point and the risks appear to be almost entirely priced in.  however, the market isn't rational and if you're a boomer you're probably not even aware the market is tanking because a lot of boomer stocks are so overvalued, at least relative to historical valuations, which isn't true of tech stocks. so perhaps now we're going to see boomer stocks take a hit for a while and that panic might drag the qqq a little lower before a sharp recovery in a few weeks/months.](/r/stocks/comments/ufis9n/hindsight_reversion_to_the_mean_suggests_market/i6w9l0g/)

1651428389,"if someone is in crypto today to make $27,000 they probably don't realize (or lived through) what happened in the 80s, 90s or early 2000s.  my dad had am opportunity to buy $1,500 of microsoft stock for 17 cents.  i bought stock in intel and amd.  we both made thousands of dollars but got out.   we didn't stay in for life changing money.   you fail to see that i am not complaining about the money i didn't make if i had cashed out, but about the direction the team is going.  they need to change that.  look at apple back in the early 80s.  i had an apple ii computer.  i learned to program in basic, fortran, pascal and cobol because i knew that was the future.   then what happened?  apple, the personal computer lost focus and disappeared.  they came back in the 90s with the ipod and look where they are today.  they lost focus.  
     if you think i didn't pull out my initial investment, you are naive.  i have already pulled out my initial investments on shib, saitama, eth, btc and others.   i am currently holding more than 10k but less than 100k of crypto that i have already pulled out initial investment.  i am, as you say, out nothing.  what happens when the entire market cap of crypto hits 5 trillion? 10trillion? 50 trillion?  that's life changing money.  all i did was answer the op question of why people are here.  i can't answer why others are here, i am answering why i am here.  am i bitter?  no.  the entire crypto market was down over 200 billion yesterday alone and down 1.5 trillion from ath.  your reply to my post shows me (and others) that your mindset is that of a ""fan boy"" and your comprehension leans on the negative side.  i was not being negative,  just answering a question.  i don't fud.  but i also don't look at a duck and call it a cow.  i see what the team is doing and they are not rocking on all cylinders like they were from may to november.  basically, they couldn't do anything wrong. then nov 13th happened.  and it never recovered.  does saitama have the ability to be the microsoft or apple of crypto?  yes. can they also go the way of beta instead of vhs?  yes.  they can turn this around now, later or never.  fortunately, they are still working hard at it, but need to learn from their mistakes.  it really makes me sick when i see people posting ""3 days of green in a row"" when the last 100 days were red.  i feel sorry for the people who got in and have been down ever since.  if you take 1 thing away from my original post, or this post, stay in for the long term.   no one bought amazon stock to make life changing money because they sold books. people saw the bigger picture.   i hope saitama and saitamask turn it around.  if not, it will go the way of aol.  i got into shib at the previous ath and kept buying the dips.  then, shibaswap came out.   it traded sideways up and down for months.  i kept buying as long as it was cheaper than my last purchase.  
     so no, i am not mad that i didn't get out when i was up $27k.  that is not life changing money. it just pays the bills for a bit or pays off my car.  that's it.  i am in crypto to make life changing money.  from the sound of it, you are here to make yourself feel better by finding the negative in anything. i hope you see what i see and realize what is actually happening. call the team out when they make bonehead moves and praise the team when they make remarkable strides!",7,,Pepsiholic251,0
1651428891,"to expand on $aapl - if this headwind were a one-time occurrence, it would be easy for apple to live with it briefly, make some tweaks and then move on. but the reality is apple‚Äôs china-based final assembly strategy has suffered problems for years‚Äîeven before the pandemic.

- back in 2019, in what was then a rare move, apple said holiday-quarter revenue would be lower than it expected. it cited supply-chain constraints affecting the ipad, apple watch, airpods and macbook air.

- trade tensions with china during the last administration led to apple products getting slapped with tariffs. that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre produced in china and shipped back to the u.s. for sale.

- when the pandemic hit in 2020, the initial wave of shutdowns roiled apple‚Äôs supply chain anew. delayed products included the iphone se and iphone 12.

- in 2021, apple said the chip shortage and other supply constraints cost it billions of dollars.

- now, in 2022, shutdowns affecting foxconn technology group and other final assembly partners‚Äîalong with the lingering chip shortage and ukraine war‚Äîare threatening to erase $4 billion to $8 billion in sales from the june quarter.

1651442535,"&gt;	nope. what makes you think a tiny uptick in trading volume is going to harm your shares?

the wealthiest people own 90% of all stocks. so 90% of all shares held would be subject to this new non-realized gain tax. it would stand to reason that it would be more than a tiny uptick. 

&gt;	the term is a verbal disguise.  do you seriously contend the owner‚Äôs wealth has not increased by the amount of the appreciation?

it commonly used and is legally defined. you see absolutely no distinction between my aapl stock going up and me continuing to hold it versus selling it? 

&gt;	so the working child doesn‚Äôt pay ss or medicare along with federal, state and local income tax?

they will most likely not pay federal income taxes. state/income tax isn‚Äôt particularly relevant to the conversation. you get ssi and medicare back when you retire.

1651468100,"this isn‚Äôt exactly the right answer. when you invest with a traditional you reduce your taxable income by the amount of money you put into your account. let‚Äôs say your effective tax rate is 20% you invest 5000$ you save 1000$ in taxes. but when you retire and withdraw from your ira you will have to pay taxes on the money. for most people, they will need to withdraw significantly more than they are able to contribute on a yearly basis. so let‚Äôs say you need 20,000 a year from you ira you must withdraw 24,000 from your account every year to cover that amount. 

if you invest in a roth ira you take the 20,000$ out of your account leaving the extra 4,000 for it to grow. your ira should last longer, and since you are theoretically earning more in now than you will in retirement, the smaller upfront burden should be easier to take. 
my father left behind a traditional ira for my mom which i manage. i made a significant investment in apple stock in 2018 with this account. the small investment is now worth as much as the original balance my father left. if the account was a roth account, my mother would be able to withdraw what she needed to supplement her retirement tax free. but because it‚Äôs a traditional retirement account she has to withhold significant amounts to cover her tax burdens. while the growth has covered the withdrawals it‚Äôs painful to sell and liquidate positions that are very successful. 

this is purely anecdotal, but if you retire with a roth ira, the amount you need saved at your time of retirement is significantly less than it would be with a traditional ira.",2,,Longhorn24,0

1651480216,"no the way it works is they put up collateral for the loan using the value of the shares at the time of the loan. the amount of collateral will depend on the loan and the person

if those shares then go up in value, for example 10x like tesla has, the size of the collateral would be far larger than the loan. this however doesn't mean the bank gets all the collateral if he defaults on the loan, they still only get the agreed monetary value of it.

example: i borrow 1bn using 1mil apple stock valued at $1000 as collateral. apple rises to $5000. if i default on my loan it will still only be a $1bn loan even though my stock is now worth $	5bn and the bank will only get a small portion of the stock equal to loan plus interest. 

it may be the case they get good rates because of large collateral but there's no reason to have collateral above the value of the loan.",1,,The-Purple-Chicken,0

i should point out, the original ipod was also panned as crap and by the time the iphone came out, the ipod was a very respectable portable music player with a huge following. so a lot of us that thought the iphone was lacking in features _at the time_ expected that it would eventually get better.

i had my mom buy a lot of apple stock in 2002. at the time, apple's r&amp;d department was really kicking amazing stuff out and there were lots of reasons to expect great things from apple. sadly we had to sell that stock shortly thereafter, so no huge payday... but i wasn't surprised that things like the ipod or iphone really took off. 

i was such a fan of ios that i even ended up buying an ipod touch lol. using pc websites on a portable was cool, when up till then most devices only supported wap websites. 

so yeah, i don't think everyone totally blew off the iphone. i think a lot of tech sites just thought what apple launched on day 1 still was missing a lot of things that we'd came to expect on other smartphones. and that was justified.",17,,Kyanche,0

[there is a shortage of houses of at least 2-5 million. so how do we get from current rents to a situation where rents can't support yields?   most of these homes are bought without inspection because they are 1. relatively new homes and shouldn't have many problems, 2. they have their own maintenance teams that will inspect and repair any problems before and during occupancy. so why pay for an inspection if the company knows the industry? this is the case for many contractor/flippers who can size up a home way better and quicker than an inspection. all it does it increases costs and wastes time.   as far as overpaying for homes? this is all relative to rents. why would rents go down? they build sophisticated models that are arguably way better than what a single real estate appraiser can do to value a home. also the value of the homes is relative to prices and rents in other markets in other geographical areas, something a local appraiser absolutely can't determine.   i suspect that investors appetites could wain for rbs. but in inflationary times, investors actually take the opposite perspective and buy the asset and sell the debt, which is exactly what we are seeing in the mbs market. investors have been selling mbs and buying assets in the form of real estate and commodities.   if appetites for rbs does indeed wain, then these companies would stop purchasing homes, and rents would shift from renting to now buying homes that are now more affordable. they wouldn't necessarily have to file bankruptcy, they would simply stop buying homes and collect rents for themselves.   from an utilitarian point of view, home users are indifferent between renting and buying a home. but from a financial prospective, there are pros and cons of renting vs. owning, depending on how much rents are relative to prices and interest rates. the most important thing here is that there has to be a decrease in the demand for housing from an utilitarian prospective for there to be a decrease in home prices.  and sense we have both a short-term reduction in the supply of new homes due to supply chain disruptions and a long-term shortage in supply to meet demand, i don't see how either rents or home prices are subject to any sort of crash anytime soon.](/r/stockmarket/comments/ufi552/how_the_next_housing_crisis_will_happen_it_sure/i6tyz4l/)

[you're basically just pulling numbers out of hat. the situation in late 2018 was different than today. arguably the economic backdrop today is worse, but then again a lot of nasdaq stocks have already been hit significantly harder than in late 2018. most tech stocks are trading significantly below the valuations they hit going into 2019 at this point.  i can't help but feel the nasdaq is really going to struggle to fall much lower. for example i've been running numbers on amzn and how i run them it looks unbelievably undervalued at this point. you basically have to assume that their ecommerce segment will continue to drag on the business for years. same with fb and nflx. i don't think they're great businesses, but they are significantly undervalued in my opinion.  then there are the quality quality growth stocks like shop which are now trading at their lowest valuation in like 7 years despite now being profitable and being far less risky than they were in say 2016 because of their scale and maturity.  it's even getting hard to argue trash ""growth"" stocks like hood or tdoc should fall more. i'm not saying they couldn't fall more if their businesses continue to struggle, but they're certainly not expensive at this point and the risks appear to be almost entirely priced in.  however, the market isn't rational and if you're a boomer you're probably not even aware the market is tanking because a lot of boomer stocks are so overvalued, at least relative to historical valuations, which isn't true of tech stocks. so perhaps now we're going to see boomer stocks take a hit for a while and that panic might drag the qqq a little lower before a sharp recovery in a few weeks/months.](/r/stocks/comments/ufis9n/hindsight_reversion_to_the_mean_suggests_market/i6w9l0g/)

[my moves this week. calls on murphy oil, estee lauder, and goodyear tires this week. puts on airbnb, doordash, and mercado libre. sell murphy oil and goodyear tire calls before the closing bell though if you‚Äôre in the green. sell airbnb and mercado libre puts if you‚Äôre in the green before the closing bell.   mercado libre burned a lot of bears last time, and i would think people would go into the trade feeling bearish considering what happened to amzn. airbnb has a chance to resurge provided people are traveling after being cooped up for 2 years. this stock is still overvalued at 90+ billion though, especially in this uncertain fiscal climate.  murphy oil is a no brainer; natural resource stocks still have room to run i feel, but you could lose in the short term price action if earnings don‚Äôt match up with the upcoming demand we‚Äôll probably have for crude. i‚Äôll buy shares if earnings results into a bloodbath. goodyear is the biggest gamble i feel, out of the 6 i mentioned. still, i don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs overvalued in the slightest to warrant a huge sell off. i was very surprised it‚Äôs only valued at just below 4 billion. last year they made more than 10 billion on revenue, and with everyone starting to get back on the road en masse, i think we‚Äôll see things improve due to higher demand.  remember this is only the moves of a degenerate retard, so you can probably make big cash inversing me. happy trading y‚Äôall!](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uf9mro/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/i6xyhvw/)

[the dotcom bubble is completely incomparable for anyone paying attention to valuations. during the dotcom bubble you had companies with crappy gross margins (&lt; 20%) trading at like 30x sales. even at growth tech's peak last year companies didn't have those kinds of valuations. most growth tech was trading at like 20-30x sales with 50%+ gross margins.  at this point a lot of growth tech companies are trading at like 10x sales with 50%+ gross margins. those are far more reasonable valuations and quite easily achievable with reasonable growth and net margin assumptions.  i don't even really understand why people believe big tech is over valued at this point. these are some of the most profitable companies in the world and they're consistently returning those profits to share holders via massive stock buy backs. i think a good argument could be made that these are far better companies to own than most dividend stocks people buy for perceived safety. the only two big ""tech"" companies i would worry about are tsla and nvda and that's because although i don't think their valuations are dot-level crazy, they are more speculatively valued compared to the other big tech companies and in a risk off environment investors are going to be more cautious with their projections.](/r/stocks/comments/ug5l85/twlo_what_happened_to_this_stock/i70nw53/)

1651510651,"youtube and the internet in general are amazing for that kind of thing these days, and if you find yourself going ""duh i already knew that,"" you probably have it down.

as for budgeting, the most basic of basics is something like this: ""i spend $x for monthly bills that are required and don't change much (rent, utilities, car note. even if they vary, set aside enough for when they're at their most expensive, like electricity during the summer), $y for bills that are optional luxuries (game subscriptions, netflix if you have your own, etc), and taken from my paycheck of $z, it gives me $m. can i afford food? if i plan meals, and give myself a budget for eating out (if it's affordable), that gives me $f for food, then the leftovers...out of that, l can then afford to put $v in savings, and have $l as fun money left over.

separating the monthly bills into necessities and luxuries also helps because in a pinch, you can cancel a luxury for a bit. if i'm in dire need of food, i'm not going to worry much about my xbox ultimate, i'll cancel that real fast.

oh! and set aside money for gas if you drive, or for transportation of some kind. unless you bike, then kudos!

i'm 30 and had to learn all this the hard way, so i hope it helps at least a bit!",2,,Kurigin,0

1651514356,"i just want to clearly say that i am not a economist, but i am a financial professional, and this is really more of a financial question.

you seem to have a few misconceptions of how net worth is calculated. first off, when you are talking about people who own parts of publicly traded companies you have to factor two things, the total equity value of the company, and the amount of ownership the specific person owns.

so, for instance tsla is worth about $891b right now, and elon owns 17% of the shares, so his ownership in tsla is worth $151b, and that doesn't even factor the value of his other ventures such as spacex and boring company or any other investments he has.

i am going to ignore your question about samsung for a minute and pivot to apple.  apple was foudned by steve jobs and steve wozniak. in the 80's wozniak was forced out and he sold most of his shares for other ventures.  in the 90's jobs was forced out, and he sold all of his shares and invested in two start ups pixar and next computer.  even after jobs returned to run apple in the late 90's, he owned almost no shares of the company.  jobs never ended up becoming a billionaire from apple stock, he became a billionaire from owning 50% pixar which was bought by disney, and after the purchase jobs was the largest individual shareholder of disney (though he did not work for them).   since the early 2000's the value of apple as a company has increased from around $1b in the late 90's to over $2.5t, yet trying to find a billionaire that made that billion almost exclusively from apple stock is almost impossible, despite it being the most valuable company in the world, in fact tim cook is the only one i know of, and he is worth about $2b. [https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate-news/apple-is-the-richest-company-but-where-are-all-the-billionaires/63723633](https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate-news/apple-is-the-richest-company-but-where-are-all-the-billionaires/63723633)

if we look at bezos he owns 10.3% of amazon, which is worth $1.3t as a company. so his 10.3% is worth $130b, even though amazon as a company is worth 1/2 what apple is.

the other thing you have to consider is that companies are not valued based on sales, they are valued based on the amount of cash they generate, or more precisely the amount of cash they can generate in the future.  tsla has less sales than any of the three american car makers, but they are worth more than all three combined, because people believe in the future tsla will make more cash flow than all three of them combined.",16,,edgestander,0

1651515930,"&gt; in what sense at all is splitting 99:1 in our sample (aka. market cap) more diversified?

because it more correctly accounts for correlations* between the factors.

for an extreme example, let's assume everyone except me becomes a factor investor.  everyone allocates 50:50, resulting in then 50% of the capital being allocated to 1% of the earnings, and all that money would be sitting there earning 1/50th the return on equity.  this shifts the market cap, which shifts my index, and now i'm allocated 50:50.

to me, factor-based investing correctly identifies that there are factors, and correctly tries to diversify across them, but incorrectly misses that there are weights attached to the factors.  from my perspective, the set of people who find factor investing compelling enough to take on concentration risk, will expand until there is no factor premium left.  (which probably happens before we get to the 50:50 state from the previous paragraph.)  once that has happened, my market-cap-based index fund will capture _all_ of the diversification benefit, without taking on the concentration risk.

**let's go back to the heinz example, briefly.  assume that tomato famine you were talking about, happened.  in the unrealistically simplified world in which ketchup is the only source of calories, _a substantial portion of the population just dies_.  those people then stop buying iphones and in fact, the used iphone market is flooded, cratering the new iphone market for a generation.  i would suggest that in that example, apple stock goes down more than heinz stock, in response to the tomato famine.",1,,ADisplacedAcademic,0

1651583050,"&gt;that respondent anticipated that many people would quit shorty after april 15, which is a stock-vesting date ‚Äî but that does not appear to have been borne out.

makes sense. i know someone who works here who is a annoyed about the return. i asked if she was going to be leaving her job over it, but she said there‚Äôs no way because that would basically mean throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of apple stock.

apparently a lot of devs are just randomly thrown 50-60k worth of stock every so often and sometime multiple times a year, but the catch is they have to wait four years for it all to vest. so quitting now would mean sacrificing any unvested stock.

she also said she is able to apply to be full time remote at the company, so it might not be a blanket thing where everyone just has to go back regardless of what they do.",670,,shadowstripes,0
1651583780,"stock options/rsus are a great psychological tool to trick employees into staying. most people aren't finance/accounting majors, and don't know how to calculate the *actual* award. $60k in four years isn't worth $60k. it's worth more like $43k in four years under our current levels of inflation.

but it doesn't stop there. there is significant risk associated with being paid in stock. they're never offered ""$60k worth of apple stock."" they're offered x shares based on the *current* stock price. if the stock price goes down - which it does, even for these big blue chips companies - that $43k becomes a lot less. imputing historical risk into apple's stock price would put this award at closer to $30k.

finally, there is opportunity cost. what could the person do with that $60k today? down payment on a house? stocks? that money could be used to earn at least an additional $10k in the next four years. this sits the other side of the $30k, meaning the *actual* award is closer to $20k. not nothing, but is that really worth staying at a company you're unhappy at for four years? chances are all of these developers can leave and earn another $100k elsewhere, from home.",-16,,decidedlysticky23,0

[&gt; this is the exact definition of cherry picking. you pick one company (apple) that has done very well and ignore the many more that did not.  it's not cherry picking at all. it's proof that just because something hasn't happened before doesn't mean it can't happen. that kind of reasoning by analogy is exactly how people got tesla wrong in the past;  ""no automotive company has ever grown 50% per year for multiple years"", ""no automotive company has more than 15% operating margins"", ""tesla is valued at more than the entire rest of the automotive industry combined"".  now here is tesla today, having grown 70% for multiple years in a row, with 19% operating margins and being expected to do more in net income than the entire rest of the automotive industry combined by 2024.  &gt; unfortunately your argument doesn‚Äôt make much sense - $10t is hugely different from $3t and the p/e generally has to match the growth rates of the company (see peter lynch). do you really think tesla will still be growing at 30% at a $10t market cap?  yes. perhaps not in the automotive sector (depending on how many legacy oems go bankrupt), but certainly as a whole thanks to their energy, fsd and/or ai businesses.  &gt; yes apple is overvalued right now but i would‚Äôve thought the last 6 months would‚Äôve shown you that valuations still matter.  you can't say definitively apple is overvalued. perhaps it is a bit inflated compared to the broader market thanks to the flight for safety stocks in the past 6 months, but they're also still showing significant growth and are not at any risk of being disrupted right now. either way, a p/e of 27 for the largest company in the world, with no current disruption risk, a small dividend and still decent growth is nothing all too crazy.](/r/stocks/comments/ug29n0/what_are_your_favorite_arkk_holdings_on_fire_sale/i706ftk/)

1651587941,"nvidia is one of the handful of companies building ai at scale. there are a lot of startups as well as the big players such as alibaba; amazon, google, microsoft, apple etc but nobody is really consistently delivering and executing like jensen is. imagine zen and lisa su but for ai and jensen. some would argue that jensen is on zen 6 for ai (in terms of execution).

(1 kepler, 2 maxwell, 3 pascal, 4 volta, 5 ampere, 6 hopper)

i don't believe in nvidia omniverse but being able to buy a top ai ecosystem every 2 years with measurable performance gains is something i wouldn't bet against.

there is also the market cap for ai. i know jensen said the market cap for ai could be a trillion but i recently listened to a reith lecture from the bbc by stuart russell on ai. he is a professor at berkley that advises international bodies such as nato or the eu on matters of ai in defence or the impact of ai the workforce.

his opinion was that the market for ai was a quadrillion so 1000 times bigger than the tam jensen estimates.  (he was trying to advocate for governments to be more open and transparent between nations because ai would be so disruptive that everyone in the world can benefit)

i don't have any nvidia stock (i might have it indirectly in an index fund) but i think its kind of bad to compare amd vs nvidia because in terms of markets they only compete in consumer gpus. in enterprise amd gpus are focused on hpc (high performance computing) while nvidia is ai. obviously the gpus can do both but they are real beasts in their specific field.

the other field that nvidia is dominant is software. nvidia is cuda and its hard to break from their ecosystem when everything only works with the code that nvidia writes. of course amd is challenging this but even if amd makes perfect code that emulates nvidia's, nvidia is still the company that is researching and patented these things and thus they have that ability to make gamers say rtx instead of raytracing. when you see nvidia's shiny demos; detailed white papers, resources easily available and an army of developers, they don't care about the black box unfortunately. 

i pretty sure nvidia gave some developers dgx-1 during turing just so there would be a handful of rtx games and those games that ended up with no rtx is simply because they had no dgx-1 to develop rtx into their games (my speculation).

i still think nvidia is too high but this is why i believe the market thinks its justified. if anything i'm not sure why amd is so low &gt;.&gt;",2,,superspacecakes,0

[i think you need a more coherent strategy. if you want to pick stocks you need to keep up with developments in the company, its competitors and its sector. i think these companies are a bit too random to do that comfortably. my advice would be to create a set of companies with wich you're already somewhat familiar, interested and in the loop. other sectors you want exposure to but don't want to stay up to date on you could target by specialized funds and the rest just sits in a broad fund potentially available for oppertunities in the sectors you follow.  i think most people don't enjoy staying up-to-date on companies like sci, awk, unh, hal. to understand their situation you need to know the management and the sector, which nobody does for fun.  msft, amzn, nvda are also too random for you to stay interested in i guess. so maybe go for defense companies and retail to start with and add the nasdaq or more specialized etf to cover tech. and keep an eye out for the price/earnings (pe), because stuff like amzn, nvda and cost are just too expensive to casually hold.](/r/stocks/comments/ugu8zp/please_roast_my_longterm_hold_portfolio/i72adv4/)

[i think you need a more coherent strategy. if you want to pick stocks you need to keep up with developments in the company, its competitors and its sector. i think these companies are a bit too random to do that comfortably. my advice would be to create a set of companies with wich you're already somewhat familiar, interested and in the loop. other sectors you want exposure to but don't want to stay up to date on you could target by specialized funds and the rest just sits in a broad fund potentially available for oppertunities in the sectors you follow.  i think most people don't enjoy staying up-to-date on companies like sci, awk, unh, hal. to understand their situation you need to know the management and the sector, which nobody does for fun.  msft, amzn, nvda are also too random for you to stay interested in i guess. so maybe go for defense companies and retail to start with and add the nasdaq or more specialized etf to cover tech. and keep an eye out for the price/earnings (pe), because stuff like amzn, nvda and cost are just too expensive to casually hold.](/r/stocks/comments/ugu8zp/please_roast_my_longterm_hold_portfolio/i72adv4/)

[the dotcom bubble is completely incomparable for anyone paying attention to valuations. during the dotcom bubble you had companies with crappy gross margins (&lt; 20%) trading at like 30x sales. even at growth tech's peak last year companies didn't have those kinds of valuations. most growth tech was trading at like 20-30x sales with 50%+ gross margins.  at this point a lot of growth tech companies are trading at like 10x sales with 50%+ gross margins. those are far more reasonable valuations and quite easily achievable with reasonable growth and net margin assumptions.  i don't even really understand why people believe big tech is over valued at this point. these are some of the most profitable companies in the world and they're consistently returning those profits to share holders via massive stock buy backs. i think a good argument could be made that these are far better companies to own than most dividend stocks people buy for perceived safety. the only two big ""tech"" companies i would worry about are tsla and nvda and that's because although i don't think their valuations are dot-level crazy, they are more speculatively valued compared to the other big tech companies and in a risk off environment investors are going to be more cautious with their projections.](/r/stocks/comments/ug5l85/twlo_what_happened_to_this_stock/i70nw53/)

1651596162,"&gt;is that accurate so far?

yes.

&gt;i assume that these stocks and bonds all pay ""dividends"" of some kind?

no. a bond is you giving a company or government entity a loan. yes, you get interest payments on the loan.

a share of stock is a share of actual ownership in a company. the company may or may not distribute part of it's profit to shareholders in the form of a dividend.  they may choose to reinvest their profit in growing their business to make even more profit instead of paying a dividend. the more profit there is per share, the more that share is worth. the more the share is worth, the more someone else is willing to pay for it if you sell it.

within your 401k you probably own shares of mutual funds. a mutual fund is an investment pool. like lets say you and i and your brother all put $1000 into an investment pool and the manager now has $3000 to invest. it could be invested in stocks or bonds or even other things. you and i and your brother each own 1 share of the mutual fund even if the mutual fund owns 10 shares of apple, 8 shares of microsoft and 12 shares of visa stock. today our one share of the mutual fund is worth $1000. it will be worth something different tomorrow depending on the closing values for the investments within the fund.

clear as mud?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;how much of my portfolio is due to shares just being worth more?

i cannot answer that because i do not know what you've chosen to invest in.  if you're invested in growth stocks (stocks that aim to grow their profits thereby making their shares more valuable), probably a lot. if you're invested in bonds, probably not much.

there is a very good beginner investing book called learn to earn by peter lynch. the first couple chapters start with basic definitions for things like ""stock"" and ""bond"" and also explanations of the basic investing concepts. it wouldn't take you long to read, especially the first couple chapters, and you will have a much, much better understanding.

i've tried to begin to answer your questions here, but there's not really any reason to write a primer here when it's already been done. the book i mentioned worked for me, but i'm sure there are a myriad of other sources too.",1,,throwaway20698059,0

1651603778,"i'm speculating, but you can probably make a similar chart from sometime around 2009-2014 showing competing cellphone manufacturers such as $nok, $mot $palm and $bby versus $aapl and i imagine it would look astonishingly similar because people buy stocks for what may happen in the future, not what is happening in the present. 

this is also the reason why you often see a stock go down after record-beating earnings combined with bad forward projections or go up on the inverse.  what i see on this chart is that legacy auto manufacturers are failing to build a future that can compete with tesla in the same way that legacy cellphone makers failed to compete with the iphone.

some observations: $tsla kills it on profit margins (like apple did with smartphones) $tsla has also effectively become the default brand for electric cars. (also like apple did with smartphones) and $tsla seems to have mastered innovation for a nascent market (again, as did apple.) slightly less relevant but still interesting: tesla even has an asshole for a ceo, relied on subsidies for the first few years just like apple did with smartphones and has an almost religious fanatic type fanboy following.

there are more similarities one can make, but the basic takeaway is that if you are just looking at today, this chart fails to make sense, but looking forward, assuming $tsla continues to deliver, it's hard to argue they don't have the potential to do for automotive/transportation/energy/ai what apple did with phones (for example, apple once took more than 100% of the profit from the smartphone market)  [https://www.macworld.com/article/229087/apple-takes-more-than-100-percent-of-smartphone-profits-after-samsungs-galaxy-recall.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/229087/apple-takes-more-than-100-percent-of-smartphone-profits-after-samsungs-galaxy-recall.html) 

further... if tesla continues to crush it, this chart may be just the beginning. think about how apple was hindered by google. google open sourced the androidos and essentially spoiled the market for apple by spawning a thousand competitors who had roughly equal tech handed to them essentially free. if not for that move by google, there would likely be no other serious competitors to iphone today. i don't believe there is a similar benefactor in the automotive industry doing the same thing for tesla's competitors (aside from tesla's own patent open source initiative, which contains a poison pill almost kuarateening competitors should avoid using it). 

disclaimer: don't listen to me... i'm a giant douchenozzle, but i happen to have owned apple and tesla stonks for a long time and have been happy with both.  i almost guarantee you'll lose money listening to me.

the point about being 1:1 is good - though in this specific case msft would've still likely have been favorable because amazon does a super underhanded thing where stocks vest very little until your 3rd and 4th years - whereas microsoft employees (as per faang standard) vest linearly.

but the tax thing i go into in another reply - there's no cap gains for rsu vests. vested shares are taxed *as income* at the price upon vest, which forces the sale of a portion of the vest itself to cover taxes. if you sell the remainder immediately there's no spread, and so no additional tax liability.

so if you vest 10 shares of msft, 4 may be withheld for tax as income - which happens regardless of if you're hodling or selling, 6 shares end up actually in your control. if you sell those 6 shares immediately there's no additional tax liability since there's no spread from the vesting event.",5,,potatolicious,0

to whom it may concern,


i've read and heard many speeches from warren buffett as i started investing any disposable income i had over the past 15 years.¬†¬†


it appears berkshire hasn't invested in the semiconductor space given every aspect of our future lives will be dependent on computing devices.¬† berkshire smartly purchased apple stock but has largely stayed out of the rest of the sector.¬† apple is depending on tsmc to provide them with the necessary production capabilities for their central processing units so in a way, berkshire is invested in the semiconductor space.¬† but those processors are for consumers.


i would like to suggest looking at advanced micro devices.¬† amd makes processors for consumers as well as datacenters (highest margins ~60% +).¬† they provide the best, lowest cost to operate processors in the market.¬† they will continue to provide some of the most competitive datacenter processors for the foreseeable future. the amd management has performed admirably since 2015 in controlling costs, releasing products which are desired by consumers (desktop cpus, laptop cpus,¬† gaming console cpu/gpu combos) and graphics processors, as well as businesses (data center cpus).¬† the management team is led by a phd electrical engineer who focuses her energy on creating value for customers, and shareholders.¬† the whole team is focused on executing and delivering without over promising.


i saw that mr. buffet likes what oxy has done to control debt levels and returning cash to shareholders.¬† the amd management has done the same in the past 5 years.¬† now they are planning to return free cash flow to shareholders by buying back stock and likely issue dividends starting in 2023.¬†¬†


based on the classic pe measures, amd's forward pe is the same as walmart.¬† walmart revenues grow at 1.5 to 3 times the inflation rate.¬† amd has grown at a rate of 50% plus for the past three years and will continue to grow at 30% plus for the next 3 years.¬† this is a value growth play.¬† everyone needs these specialized semiconductors and therefore any inflationary pressures can be passed on the end consumers.¬†


i think your team should look at the opportunity here and consider it as a minimum 5 year investment.


in short, if you like oxy enough to buy it, you should consider buying amd because the management is equally focused on increasing shareholder value and will have a much faster growth rate.


thank you


p.s. - taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation (tsm) is also grossly undervalued.¬† note that apple is one of their customers.¬† amd is their second largest customer. they are building fabrication facilities in the us.¬†",20,,reliquid1220,0

it's very possible his beloved apple would no longer even exist in the first place. microsoft made agreements with apple back in 97 because of apple vs microsoft, and even though microsoft won that suit, they decided due to then ongoing antitrust investigations (us vs microsoft began in 98, but of course things were happening even before that) that it would be better for them to prop up apple as a competitor. that helped stabilize apple stock as well as let apple say ""we have office on the mac"", and it was really due to those negotiations between jobs and gates that gave apple an opportunity to recover from mismanagement.

1651630463,"apple's salary range is very average for the industry. the only way they've been able to recruit top talent is because they're apple, and because rsus are nice and keep vesting over time. and apple stock has been doing well (same cannot be said lately of amazon's, twitter's or netflix's).

now it's only starting on may 23rd that all apple employees are supposed to show up three days a week. right now it's only two days a week.

it's very demoralizing because there is zero justification for the policy. it makes zero sense. some are happy to be able to get back to the office because their home situation is not ideal. and that's great. but most are not happy to have to get back there when they don't even need to be there to get shit done. in fact for most their productivity sucks on office days. what's worse is that manager have been trying to ask for exceptions or flexiblity, and they've been hearing a big fan no from above.

a lot of apple employees are job hunting right now. truly, it's more like they're putting feelers out. today i was just talking to someone who moved across the bay and got a baby during the pandemic. he's been there for over 15 years, and for the first time ever in two decades, he's putting his resume together.

something else: rsu worth is often matched by prospective employers in their job offers. if you tell them ""alright, i've got this much unvested but it's currently worth $80k"", it's not uncommon at all for the other employer to match it in salary, rsu/options, or combination thereof. everything is negotiable. especially lately. and hell, some people are ready to take a pay cut for fully remote, because they did the math of the additional expenses the rto represents. but honestly, unless you're fairly entry-level or do something not tech or marketing related, you can probably find a better salary somewhere else.

the big mistake apple's leadership is making is that a lot of the top talent is already looking for other jobs. the ones most likely to stay usually are the ones phoning it in (figuratively, obviously), sitting at their desk and coasting, waiting for the next batch of rsus to vest and their espp to build up. i've seen that in another great tech company before, which eventually turned into a shell of its own self because of clueless leadership that let the good people go and the slackers mooch.",27,,SpaceJackRabbit,0

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""

i'm not sure i understand where you're getting your ""misleading"" idea from, but those (as well as many others, again) not only agree on sperm + egg = human being, but explicitly that pre-embryonic organisms being such is no longer supported scientifically. this is where the ""so masturbation must be genocide"" gimmick loses scientific backing, as well as your bit about sperm and eggs separately being equal to zygotes.   


&gt;the discussion is absolutely one of morality/religion, where the scientific basis is simply to justify a certain viewpoint or opinion.

not only is this statement itself your opinion, not fact, but if medical science echoes moral/religious arguments then that gives them **even more** credibility. if you want to discredit actual medical science documentation because it supports the idea that life begins at conception, then do so with data counter to it...not your opinion.",1,,bytes_of_keys,0

[dox, ida g. et al. the harper collins illustrated medical dictionary. new york: harper perennial, 1993, p. 146]


""embryo: the early developing fertilized egg that is growing into another individual of the species. in man the term 'embryo' is usually restricted to the period of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of pregnancy.""
[walters, william and singer, peter (eds.). test-tube babies. melbourne: oxford university press, 1982, p. 160]


""the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[langman, jan. medical embryology. 3rd edition. baltimore: williams and wilkins, 1975, p. 3]


""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum (zygote), a new life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
[considine, douglas (ed.). van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943]


""i would say that among most scientists, the word 'embryo' includes the time from after fertilization...""
[dr. john eppig, senior staff scientist, jackson laboratory (bar harbor, maine) and member of the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 31]


""the development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
[sadler, t.w. langman's medical embryology. 7th edition. baltimore: williams &amp; wilkins 1995, p. 3]


""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""
[jonathan van blerkom of university of colorado, expert witness on human embryology before the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 63]


""zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1]


""the chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and male pronuclei. these pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2n nucleus of the fertilized zygote. this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
[larsen, william j. human embryology. 2nd edition. new york: churchill livingstone, 1997, p. 17]


""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
[o'rahilly, ronan and mÔøΩller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. this textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" (p. 12}]


""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
[carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3]


""[a]nimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....",0,,8Romans,0

it sold about 2 minutes later for $70 and now i'm wondering what would've happened if i just asked for a bit more. heck, maybe if i had hung around i could've gotten it back to what i paid and not lost anything. or even made a few bucks.

further, the reason i say open your mind is that you will need to re assess what money is over the next ten years. oil would make a reasonably good medium of exchange and store of value. obviously practically this is impossible. with blockchain, ownership of a barrel of oil can be represented as a token that can be transacted with. perhaps as a form of money in some cases, perhaps for other uses at other times. the same is true of gold. the same is true of an apple stock. the same is true of the s and p 500 index. the same is true of a basket of all of these assets together. you are going to see financial innovation over the next decade that you could not have imagined in your wildest dreams.",0,,Hang10Dude,0

i would recommend mostly buying etfs, then allocating maybe up to 30% of your portfolio in stocks when you think its appropriate (i'm not a pro)

stocks like $msft $goog $amzn could be a good starting point after researching them and considering their current price. 

much later on once you have a good feel for your risk tolerance, you could consider growth/hyper-growth stocks. but keep the allocation relatively small and make sure you're not stress-checking them every day. 

i'm going through the same process. i made a few mistakes, but fundamentally you just want to buy when the market is low (its pretty low right now) and sell as per your plan. i am currently investing 20% of my wages and plan to hold for 10+ years. i will probably cut down to 10%-15% in a few months time because i will need more spending money then. 

don't trade cfds, options or leave yourself too little money to spend. pay off accumilating debt beforehand and make sure you're investing into your life (eg. repairing your car or your health which may pay off better in the long run) i've made many stupid mistakes thinking the market is something that it isn't.",3,,RedditInvestAccount,0

1651703888,"keep watching videos.  take a small amount of money and get on an app and invest. buy 1 share of a few things.  watch.  learn.  rewatch videos.  try new things.  watch. learn.  rewatch videos.  

you just have to do it to really comprehend.  invest at least $100 as an education and play around and try the things you‚Äôre learning about.  when you‚Äôre comfortable try some more complex things.  take it slow,  it‚Äôs a great market to learn in but a costly one if you throw a bunch of money in now.

biggest recommendation is to figure out what the price of the stocks is derived from.  that will change your whole outlook and keep you from misunderstanding many things.  many people don‚Äôt understand this and say and do really dumb things based on their misunderstanding.

it‚Äôs the last price someone paid for shares btw.  do some thought exercises on that and how it could play out.  let‚Äôs say apple is $200 per share and has a market cap of 3 trillion dollars.  market cap is the total amount of shares x the share price (last price paid). this means apple is valued at 3 trillion dollars and each share you‚Äôre buying is paying that price for a small ownership in apple.  

lets say you slowed the market down and you were the only person to buy a share in an hour.  let say you enter a bid (what buyers are paying) of $200 but it doesn‚Äôt go through.  you look at the ask (what sellers want for it) and the cheapest ask is 1 share fo $300.  the next is $400 for 5.  you buy that one share for $300 and now your account shows you are even because the last price paid was $300.  what are the ramifications of that sale in a slowed down market?  well now everyone else‚Äôs shares are now $300 as well.  so their accounts show a gain 50% on their apple stock.  if there is 200 million shares then $300-200, $100 x 200,000,000 shares equals 20 billion dollars of new money showing in everyones account that holds apple stock.  

did we just create $20 billions dollars in wealth for everyone by spending $300?  nope.  that is why it‚Äôs called an unrealized gain.  the next person to sell a share will change the price again and that person will have a realized gain that they pay taxes on.

valuation is really important to understand so you don‚Äôt pay 160 billion valuation for  a company earning income of 100‚Äôs of millions.  those stocks usually fail.


might seem like silly things but 30 years ago when i started investing, if i understood those small details i would have made not made a ton of mistakes.

1651704406,"# finding strongly connected components / building condensation graph

## definitions
you are given a directed graph $g$ with vertices $v$ and edges $e$. it is possible that there are loops and multiple edges. let's denote $n$ as number of vertices and $m$ as number of edges in $g$.

**strongly connected component** is a maximal subset of vertices $c$ such that any two vertices of this subset are reachable from each other, i.e. for any $u, v \in c$:

$$u \mapsto v, v \mapsto u$$

where $\mapsto$ means reachability, i.e. existence of the path from first vertex to the second.

it is obvious, that strongly connected components do not intersect each other, i.e. this is a partition of all graph vertices. thus we can give a definition of condensation graph $g^{scc}$ as a graph containing every strongly connected component as one vertex. each vertex of the condensation graph corresponds to the strongly connected component of graph $g$. there is an oriented edge between two vertices $c_i$ and $c_j$ of the condensation graph if and only if there are two vertices $u \in c_i, v \in c_j$ such that there is an edge in initial graph, i.e. $(u, v) \in e$.

the most important property of the condensation graph is that it is **acyclic**. indeed, suppose that there is an edge between $c$ and $c'$, let's prove that there is no edge from $c'$ to $c$. suppose that $c' \mapsto c$. then there are two vertices $u' \in c$ and $v' \in c'$ such that $v' \mapsto u'$. but since $u$ and $u'$ are in the same strongly connected component then there is a path between them; the same for $v$ and $v'$. as a result, if we join these paths we have that $v \mapsto u$ and at the same time $u \mapsto v$. therefore $u$ and $v$ should be at the same strongly connected component, so this is contradiction. this completes the proof.

the algorithm described in the next section extracts all strongly connected components in a given graph. it is quite easy to build a condensation graph then.

1651712955,"you might want to start with giving an exemple that is correct. the fish syntax doesn't have the `do`.

there are a few reasons why someone would want to use fish (especially as a interactive shell). 

for starter the syntax makes more sense and is less cluttered. with the syntax highlighting and auto-indention, it's easy to remember the syntax.

on top of that, variables with fish are arrays. you don't have to worry about setting the `ifs` (what a cluster fuck that thing is by the way). you can have the shell make combinations by simply writing `$v1$v2`. when typing `$v` each element of the list is an argument. you don't have to worry about spaces or whatever nonsense.

but yes, i agree with you - the crypto market is oversaturated with schemes and scams.  everyone's playing roulette spreading buys over meme coins hoping to strike gold with the next dogecoin.  bitcoin might one day double in value - but that'll largely be because of the value of the dollar shrinking from inflation - and even that is still taking it's sweet sweet time.  


and yes, as far as learning from past mistakes - ""we haven't learned.""  because the generation buying crypto missed out on the dotcom boom.  gen x was still struggling to pay off loans and secure their mortgages where possible.  they didn't have much money for investing.  millennials were still in school.  it was boomers who invested in the dotcom explosion, and it's the boomers warning people about crypto.

let me state this clearly for you: people's livelihoods are not a fucking game.

this mindset is exactly what got us into the 2008 financial crisis, and it's why the cryptosphere is in such a mess at the moment. and it's the same vibe that permeates through your comments.

so yeah, while you're having fun and games with your game of chicken, there are ordinary people who enter into it thinking it's all a legitimate investment. and more often than not, they lose out. they lose their homes. they lose their retirement savings. they lose everything.

1651787783,"&gt; oh no, the word human has multiple definitions so my philosophy is invalid????? this is meaningless gibberish. this is logic to you? lmao. 

nearly your entire argument at this point is that there are multiple definitions of words. no reconciliation with the fact that your contrived philosophy enables biological human beings to be killed.

the remainder of your argument is to complain about me being emotional, when i haven't been. i'd suggest actually forming an argument about why you believe it's acceptable to kill this particular group of humans.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;&gt; we shouldn't let our emotions get in the way of the biology.

&gt; then stop doing so. you can join the discussion at any time.

i suggest you take your own advice.

1651798904,"&gt; you've just quibbled with semantics and placed a completely arbitrary moral weight on the word ""organism"" that you haven't actually bothered to substantiate in any way. as of now, you've given me zero percent more reason to care about an organism right now than an ova or a flea (the latter of which is also, btw, an organism).

i don't need to convince you. by the way, you've also failed to convince me that we should be able to kill newborn babies up until they reach consciousness.

&gt; yes? life is pretty harsh; thanks for contributing to my point.

...you didn't make a point, you just expressed concern that death exists, which i also agree is pointless in this debate.

&gt; a fetus isn't a person. 

a human fetus is a human organism, and human organisms are called humans, human beings, and people.

the entirety of the rest of your argument can be refuted by the fact that human zygotes/embryos/fetuses are human organisms, not just organisms. fleas are irrelevant. you are trying to form a philosophical/moral position that excludes certain human beings from being ""people,"" specifically for the purpose of being able to kill them. this unscientific strategy is noise.

[in the latest berkshire annual meeting, both munger and buffer said that markets are not efficient. in fact, the speculative nature that has been apparent in the market has created this gap and it's really how they make money.  people are currently shocked that their portfolios are down so much. fundamental analysis would have shown that many tech stocks are overvalued and it was time to sell back in december/january.  so, back to the op, i would suggest your friend take the time to do a fundamental analysis on nflx. see for themselves what is their calculated value. if it's higher than where the stock is - keep it. if it's lower than where is - sell it. if that seems like too much work then just stick to etf's where no such analysis is needed (just macro and social trend analysis)  investing and stock picking is a discipline that takes decades to learn and is really hard work. every time you lose money, you have to ask why and not make the mistake again. i have made many mistakes and they have been costly, but when i look ahead to the future i feel the cost of those mistakes (however painful) will be worth it.](/r/stocks/comments/ui28rf/friend_with_netflix_is_down_more_than_40_i_dont/i7c8m0o/)

[the key üîë (and this is obviously easier said then done), is to take the money and run. sell at the top, or as close as you can get. somebody out there bought nflx for $100 and sold it to some schmuck for $700 and he‚Äôs probably in a hotel room with strippers and blow. meanwhile whoever picked up nflx at $700 is unlikely to see that money again.  there are enough good stocks out there that you could absolutely follow these two rules and help save yourself from a nflx selloff scenario;  - only buy stocks trading under $100/share  - sell when the insiders do (bob iger sold every last share of dis he held just about at the top, for example)  why don‚Äôt people do this? because it requires you to hold for a few years. people seem to want that quick and easy roi, but aren‚Äôt willing to let it ride long enough for a nflx to go from $100 to $700. it took many years for nflx to go from $100 to $700, but only a couple of months to go from $700 to $200. get greedy and you get slaughtered. i guarantee people were looking at the chart and thinking ‚Äúwow if this pace keeps up the $700/share will become $1000 in just a couple of months!‚Äù](/r/stocks/comments/uid196/what_is_motley_fool_and_are_they_trolling_their/i7dz6ho/)

(i know this voice well on account of getting into bad trades and immediately knowing i fucked up lol). think about when you could make a good entry (or entries) and exit (or exits) based on what it's doing.    just for full transparency, i'm not some super rich self made guy telling you this. i still work a gig economy part time job to avoid taking money out of my account, i am still very much prone to acts of overtrading, fomo, tilt, and other common errors, i have not been using this strat for more than a few months, and it's possible it will change as qe tightens.](/r/daytrading/comments/uj5u40/struggling_to_find_a_good_strategy/i7idlmz/)

1651869584,"&gt; they lied to investors to keep the stock price elevated

why they did this we'll never know. it might even just have been an honest mistake, they've been filing gaming-cards sold as gaming-revenue probably for a long time, might just be that they didn't catch it fast enough. remember they settled with them not admitting any wrongdoing. this might just be a technicality where someone is being picky with what ""gaming revenue"" means, where nvidia might rightfully argue that when they say ""gaming revenue"" that just means revenue from selling gaming-cards, it doesn't matter what the end-user actually ends up using them as. we'll never know for sure, but i think the ""they lied to investors to keep the stick price elevated"" is a bit hard of a stance, there's plenty of other likely possibilities.

&gt; keep the stock price elevated because people would have sold if they knew that the profits were so dependent on miners buying the cards

lol no, everyone knew a decent chunk of these cards went to miners. i can't imagine them misreporting gaming cards sold to miners as gaming revenue had an even measurable effect on stock price. this was a minor filing error with probably 0 actual effect on stock prices.

&gt; the majority shareholders that make up the board almost certainly profited a very very large multiple of the fine.

lol no, there's no way in hell the board directed nvidia to release reports with gaming-cards sold to miners as part of gaming-revenue thinking ""ah yes, this will prop the stock price up"", and then directed their trade of nvidia stock, all the while adhering to wait-periods when buying and selling the stock as per the norm as a board member, to possibly cash in on the 0.00001% increase something as minor as this would achieve.

1651881903,"yes, this wasn't about the profits from sales, this was about the value of a stock share and their market capitalisation, which is directly impacted by investors determining how much they're willing to pay for a share of your stock, investors would not have drove the price up that high if they know that the record sales growth was actually primarily being driven by cryptomining, which is one of the most volatile markets and had a history or collapsing in the past.

what's even more fuckey is why they lied, why they inflated the stock price. the higher their stock price went, the higher the overall value of the organization, which meant buying power. nvidia has long wanted to compete with if not crush intel and amd, who each also make desktop, mobile and processors other than gpu's. seeing arm take over mobile processing and apple's quadrupling down on arm for apple silicon, nvidia desperately wanted arm, not only to create their own silicon, but most of arm's revenue and value is arm core licensing. i've seen recent estimates that the arm acquisition was going to actually cost nvidia $75b, which would obviously come in the form of nvidia stock. if nvidia lies to their investors who then drive up the stock price 100% or more higher than it really should have been, then they'd be able to buy arm with considerably less stock. 

consider this, in december 2017, nvidia stock price was about $37 per share, giving them a market cap of about $93b. in november 2021, it hit $329 per share, giving them a market cap of about $827b, driven  by ""unprecedented demand"" for what they claimed was predominantly gaming gpus. depending on how you look at it it, the over inflated stock price would have effective allowed them to buy arm for free. they're now roughly half as valuable as they were in november, at least in part because the crypto market began collapsing for multiple reasons and all of a sudden the ""unprecedented demand"" dropped almost linearly.",3,,SeanSeanySean,0
1651883201,"hold up... do you disagree that a stocks price is driven by more than just revenues and profits?

nvidia's share price, and of course subsequently their market cap grew nearly 10x from december 2017 to november 2021, that is the price investors deemed a share was worth given their growth and long term expected performance. by lying about where the surge in gpu sales were coming from, the investors were left to believe that this surge in demand and growth was sustainable, something that wouldn't have happened at that level if it was known that even 50% of that growth was actually driven by cryptomining (betting it was more like 75%). they went from a $90b company to an $830b company in 4 years due to what investors believed was true, and nvidia was in the middle of a shopping spree trying to buy up companies, particularly arm. the higher the stock price and company value went, the more companies they could purchase and the less actual percentage of nvidia was needed to be given away to complete the sales. when you're trying to buy another company with stock, any boosts you get to your stock price is basically like free money.

it affects regular investors because many likely lost money as a result (nvidia is trading at half of their nov 2017 price), more than you realize when you think about how many funds and portfolios which make up people's ira's have nvidia stock within them. so yeah, their transgressions were also in fact against regular joe's as well.",1,,SeanSeanySean,0

&gt; nvidia's share price, and of course subsequently their market cap grew nearly 10x from december 2017 to november 2021

why are you picking november 2021 as the date?  that makes no sense.

&gt; by lying about where the surge in gpu sales were coming from

you haven't even established they lied.  they mentioned the influence of crypto on plenty of their operations.

&gt; investors were left to believe that this surge in demand and growth was sustainable

investors were left to draw their own conclusions.  if they thought crypto miners were buying zero gaming gpus they were morons.

&gt; something that wouldn't have happened at that level if it was known that even 50% of that growth was actually driven by cryptomining

you don't know that and you don't know what percentage of the one section of their company that didn't mention crypto was actually crypto.  neither do they for that matter.

&gt; they went from a $90b company to an $830b company in 4 years due to what investors believed was true

the vast majority of which was indeed true.

here's a statement from their 2018 annual report about risks to the company:

&gt; factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future
include, but are not limited to:

&gt;  ...fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies

they specifically listed cryptocurrency volatility as a risk to the company.

&gt;  nvidia was in the middle of a shopping spree trying to buy up companies, particularly arm.

and everyone party to that deal already knew the allegations against nvidia.

from their 2019 annual report:

&gt; multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on
the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of
cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand. in addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the company, filed a
derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the company against the members of our board of directors and
certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and
the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand

so no, you're lying, the arm deal did not occur in the middle of the period where nvidia supposedly lied.  it happened well after, and arm knew about the supposed lie.

&gt; the higher the stock price and company value went, the more companies they could purchase and the less actual percentage of nvidia was needed to be given away to complete the sales.

except, again, everyone in these deals already knew everything they needed to know, they didn't just stop reading annual reports after 2018.

&gt; when you're trying to buy another company with stock, any boosts you get to your stock price is basically like free money.

except you've yet to form any logic for how them ""lying"" in 2018 did anything to improve their stock price after the supposed lie was outed.

&gt; it affects regular investors because many likely lost money as a result (nvidia is trading at half of their nov 2017 price)

nvidia's highest price in 2017 was $53.  current price is $186.75.  people who held on to nvidia stock between its highest price in 2017 and current day realized a 250% gain.  that's about 5x higher than the return on the s&amp;p 500 over the same time period.

giving the new trilogy a fresh coat of paint in the remaster just seemed a bit off however. the old sprites in hd clarity don‚Äôt seem to need in the choppy 2 frame animation that used to be complimented by its original sprite work. i think they could of delved deeper and given the original animations more life in the hd remakes rather than keep it at the same level as the originals. just my take though.",10,,Maxstablook,0

[my philosophy is simple: there's huge players out there who can move hundreds of thousands of shares a minute, no problem. we're talking (https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=dailymarketsummary). i don't need to be out thinking the big players, all i have to do is catch a ride, like a mouse on a battle ship, and let it take me where it's going. quietly making 3-4 figures a day off is *simple* imo, just not at all easy otherwise there'd be lots more rich people out there.   the best resource, imo, is the market. pick a stock (amd, nvda, tsla, aapl, msft, sq, as long as it's a large cap with range and liquidity) and pick an index like spy or qqq, watch how they act off each other, watch how both act off ""big picture"" fundamentals or off news with each other, start thinking about what you would do to make money off it. start developing that traders voice in your head that can just tell when a thing is gonna move one way or another. (i know this voice well on account of getting into bad trades and immediately knowing i fucked up lol). think about when you could make a good entry (or entries) and exit (or exits) based on what it's doing.    just for full transparency, i'm not some super rich self made guy telling you this. i still work a gig economy part time job to avoid taking money out of my account, i am still very much prone to acts of overtrading, fomo, tilt, and other common errors, i have not been using this strat for more than a few months, and it's possible it will change as qe tightens.](/r/daytrading/comments/uj5u40/struggling_to_find_a_good_strategy/i7idlmz/)

[it doesn't matter how strong your bull case is and how unrealistic your bear case seems - if you go all-in in a single company, you're taking on massive risk.  how much risk you want to take on is up to you of course, but i, personally, would never pour my entire (investable) live savings into a single company. sure, googl will stay around, but is it gonna deliver what you expect it to deliver?  people have brought up the example of msft after the dot com burst, and while very unrealistic, what if this happens to googl and all of your money is in there? wouldn't feel too good i bet.  in order to make this investment worthwhile you'd probably have to expect that googl will be trading over a 5t market cap in 15 years time.  in my opinion there should at least be some diversification.  &amp;#x200b;  now one of your sentences suggests that by ""all-in"" you do in fact mean ""lump sum investing"" rather than just investing in this single position. statistically, lump sum has the superior returns. but you gotta decide for yourself. dca is easier on the psyche for most, especially in falling markets, and people don't expect the market to rally to a new high right now. many things suggest that stagnation, only slow climing, or, rather, a steady decline in on the cards, which would favor dca. however, all of that are still guesses in the end.](/r/stocks/comments/uk8csr/bear_case_against_googl_allin_with_15_year_scope/i7o8f5l/)

1651966847,"the jefferies analysts emphasized the mang group as a preferable choice over faang. mang represents microsoft, apple, nvidia, and alphabet.

analysts at jefferies have advised that investors steer clear of faang + microsoft stocks and instead embrace mang. notably, the faang group consists of facebook parent company meta platforms (nasdaq: fb), apple inc (nasdaq: aapl), amazon.com inc (nasdaq: amzn), netflix inc (nasdaq: nflx), and google‚Äòs parent company alphabet inc (nasdaq: googl). these leading companies and microsoft corporation (nasdaq: msft) have been investors‚Äô choices over the past years, yielding gains. besides being listed on nasdaq, faang and microsoft have been leading the us tech stocks.

despite having a great influence on the bull cycle for tech stocks in the us for some time, the companies are beginning to see downturns. facebook has lost nearly 37% this year, and apple has shed over 10% in the same period. in their year-to-date record, amazon has plunged over 25%, netflix down 66.82%, and alphabet has dropped 18.35%. in addition, microsoft has lost over 16% since the year started.
mang vs faang

led by sean darby, the jefferies analysts emphasized the mang group as a preferable choice over faang. mang represents microsoft, apple, nvidia corporation (nasdaq: nvda), and alphabet. darby added that faang + microsoft ‚Äúis not a homogenous group.‚Äù in his opinion, the mang group is the better choice due to ‚Äútheir balance sheet, earnings yield and fcf [free cash flow] yield.‚Äù

the federal open market committee had a two-day policy meeting on the 3rd and 4th of may. following the meeting, the federal reserve will expectedly raise the federal funds by 50 basis points. the increase equals a range of 0.75% to 1.25%. additionally, the federal reserve intends to reduce its bonds holdings. darby pointed out that the key is ‚Äúpatience.‚Äù

between january and april 2022, faang + microsoft group lost 22% to $2.21 trillion in their market valuation. in april alone, the group dropped $1.4 million in market value. meanwhile, the mang group reported a 14% loss in april and an 18% decline for the first four months of 2022.

darby is uncertain of the best time to reconsider meta, amazon, and netflix. he wrote:

    ‚Äú[we] are holding off for now on the economy slowing down sufficiently to look at acquiring 10-year treasury equity proxies.‚Äù

in february, the faang coinage was changed to aaa, representing amazon alphabet and apple and now mang is in play. during the time of the announcement, the stocks, except alphabet and apple, were performing poorly. while meta lost a lot of investors largely due to its inadequate interface, netflix struggled with strong competitors like hbo max, disney+, and more.

at writing, meta platforms stock is up 0.19% at premarket trading, apple shares also added 0.23%, and amazon stock climbed 0.20%. in addition, alphabet shares are up 0.26% to $2,368.63. however, netflix stock is down 1.12%.",7,,Throwaway_Molasses,0

1651973173,"i know a lot of investors are excited about the aapl car and have often bid up aapl stock price whenever there's headlines like this. but i honestly think that at the end of the day the apple car project will be nothing but a giant waste of money that will probably never return any kind of profit. i mean, consider this:

* there's a lot of new ev companies out there, but only 1 of them has ever achieved consistent profitability, tesla, and it took them well over 10+ years to do that. 

* apple is jumping into the ev market very late. they don't even have a single car factory, they haven't even announced a car model that they'll bring to the market in the distant future. the competition meanwhile that previously ignored ev's is collectively throwing in tens of billions of dollars into ev/battery research each year. point being by the time apple is finally ready to bring an ev to market there will be a ton more competition in the space then there is today.

* apple's brand is realistically not going to help them much at selling cars. tesla's brand is already basically the apple of the car space, in that they get a ton of free advertising in social media, and people see them as the #1 premium ev automaker. if the average person wants the best ev they'll probably look at tesla, just as if someone wants the best smartphone they'll probably look at apple because of their reputation in that space. this point goes back to the 2nd point somewhat, in that apple's brand would have been a lot more helpful at selling cars if they hadn't given tesla such a huge head start now that they're selling several hundred thousand cars a quarter.

about the only way i can see the apple car division ever returning a profit for investors in a reasonable time period is if apple can solve level 5 self driving multiple years before anyone else. but given all the competition in that space, and all the money being thrown at that problem, plus all the secrecy about their progress, i think it's impossible to really say who can solve level 5 self driving, or when they'll solve it.",62,,ShadowLiberal,0

abstract: the predominance of human biological research confirms that human life begins at conception‚Äîfertilization. at fertilization, the human beings being emerges as a whole, genetically distinct, individuated. this statement focuses on the scientific evidence of when an individual human life begins.

-department of health and human services (hhs) has made it the official policy of the united states that life begins at conception.

show me one medical or scientific journal stating different, i can reference over 100..

i'll wait.

i'm guessing you are going to have a hard time seeing as the actual definition of the word...

con¬∑cep¬∑tion 1. the action of conceiving a child or of a child being conceived.
synonyms inception of pregnancy, conceiving, fertilization, impregnation, insemination; rarefecundation

these are the facts, as is the  fact that at approximately 1.5-2 hours after conception that zygote becomes a living organism that is scientifically classified as h-sapiens. 

every embryology textbook; bar none, agrees that a new human life is created at conception. 

human life begins at fertilization
the following references illustrate the fact that a new human embryo, the starting point for a human life, comes into existence with the formation of the one-celled zygote:

""development of the embryo begins at stage 1 when a sperm fertilizes an oocyte and together they form a zygote.""
england, marjorie a. life before birth. 2nd ed. england: mosby-wolfe, 1996, p.31

-human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).
""fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. this fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.""
moore, keith l. essentials of human embryology. toronto: b.c. decker inc, 1988, p.2

""embryo: the developing organism from the time of fertilization until significant differentiation has occurred, when the organism becomes known as a fetus, a distinct new human/individuated  emerges'
cloning human beings. report and recommendations of the national bioethics advisory commission. rockville, md: gpo, 1997, appendix-2.

""embryo: an organism in the earliest stage of development; in a man, from the time of conception to the end of the second month in the uterus.""
dox, ida g. et al. the harper collins illustrated medical dictionary. new york: harper perennial, 1993, p. 146

""embryo: the early developing fertilized egg that is growing into another individual of the species. in man the term 'embryo' is usually restricted to the period of development from fertilization until the end of the eighth week of pregnancy.""
walters, william and singer, peter (eds.). test-tube babies. melbourne: oxford university press, 1982, p. 160

""the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
langman, jan. medical embryology. 3rd edition. baltimore: williams and wilkins, 1975, p. 3

""embryo: the developing individual between the union of the germ cells and the completion of the organs which characterize its body when it becomes a separate organism.... at the moment the sperm cell of the human male meets the ovum of the female and the union results in a fertilized ovum zygote, a new human life has begun.... the term embryo covers the several stages of early development from conception to the ninth or tenth week of life.""
considine, douglas (ed.). van nostrand's scientific encyclopedia. 5th edition. new york: van nostrand reinhold company, 1976, p. 943

""i would say that among most scientists, the word 'embryo' includes the time from after fertilization...""
dr. john eppig, senior staff scientist, jackson laboratory (bar harbor, maine) and member of the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 31

""the development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""
sadler, t.w. langman's medical embryology. 7th edition. baltimore: williams &amp; wilkins 1995, p. 3

""the question came up of what is an embryo, when does an embryo exist, when does it occur. i think, as you know, that in development, life is a continuum.... but i think one of the useful definitions that has come out, especially from germany, has been the stage at which these two nuclei [from sperm and egg] come together and the membranes between the two break down.""
jonathan van blerkom of university of colorado, expert witness on human embryology before the nih human embryo research panel -- panel transcript, february 2, 1994, p. 63

""zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""
moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1

""the chromosomes of the oocyte and sperm are...respectively enclosed within female and malepronuclei. these pronuclei fuse with each other to produce the single, diploid, 2n nucleus of the fertilized zygote. this moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
larsen, william j. human embryology. 2nd edition. new york: churchill livingstone, 1997, p. 17

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""
o'rahilly, ronan and mller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. this textbook lists ""pre-embryo"" among ""discarded and replaced terms"" in modern embryology, describing it as ""ill-defined and inaccurate"" p. 12

""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""
carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3

""aimal biologists use the term embryo to describe the single cell stage, the two-cell stage, and all subsequent stages up until a time when recognizable humanlike limbs and facial features begin to appear between six to eight weeks after fertilization....
""a number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the word embryo to describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. in its place, they proposed the term pre-embryo....
""i'll let you in on a secret. the term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by ivf practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. the new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo.
""the term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by ivf patients. 'don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. they won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

berkshire hathaway is *not* a business.  that‚Äôs the thing people get confused about.  it‚Äôs easier to think about it as an index fund or a vessel for downside risk mitigation.  the goal is to protect warren‚Äôs wealth (said w/o malice, mind.  he built this thing himself from the ground up.  he can run it how he damn well chooses).  

as a simplified version of this distinction, imagine you had a bunch ‚Äúa‚Äù was going to happen with 90% chance and ‚Äúb‚Äù with 10%.  the profit maximizing answer would be to bet a dollar  on ‚Äúa‚Äù, the downside risk mitigation model would say bet 90 cents on ‚Äúa‚Äù and 10 cents on ‚Äúb‚Äù.  won‚Äôt make as much but won‚Äôt lose as much.

this is pretty uncommon.  apple corporate isn‚Äôt out there buying samsung shares on the off chance that apple shits the bed.

many people have-almost certainly *correctly*- said ‚Äúif we break up berkshire hathaway each sub branch can be run to maximize profit‚Äù.  it‚Äôs been shareholder v board members for decades on this.  

what‚Äôs holding berkshire together is warren buffet, who i could bore you to tears about.  going against him is like going against tom brady or general paton.  but when he dies-and he soon will given his very advanced age-all of this gets readjudicated  from scratch.  

currently g spits money off so that other berk businesses that had a down year can use it.  that makes sense if the goal is to keep many businesses afloat through various financial vagaries, but that‚Äôs an odd goal.  most ppl just want shareholder value.

and, as we experience, it‚Äôs tough to ask management to be proficient.  berk has insurance, rail roads, apple stock, energy‚Ä¶.shot with nothing in common.  if you broke berkshire up, you get dedicated management in each sector rather than frankenstein dudes trying to do it all.

i‚Äôm not saying g is for sure getting sold, but the idea that it won‚Äôt because berkshire needs the float is missing the point entirely.  the *more* berkshire needs the float the *greater* the argument for selling g off",4,,plowfaster,0

1652102607,"[my rule with dynamic support or resistance is to only consider those with the most eyes on them, and even then only to highlight an area of interest. ideally there'd be additional areas of confluence (from more meaningful horizontals primarily...) and always triggered by a price action cue for an entry, never blind hope on the touch of those levels.  so think 5m 200e, daily 21e etc. (the major mas and emas, but even then i'd suggest avoiding the clutter of too many moving averages), or daily value area highs and lows, or pocs, vwap etc.  keltners, bb bands and other such indicators... hmmm... they're just less used, there's tons of settings and timeframes that might be being used on so definitely not as many participants playing whatever the levels they draw are.   i mean, if you're trading a range then you don't really need those indicators to tell you you're at an area of interest or that pop above a level might fall back down... if you're trading a trend there are better tools (literally a simple break of a trend line on the pullback for example).  so yeah, not a big fan lol.  edit. just to add, and perhaps be more constructive haha, i'm not one of those price action purists. i quite value stochs in my trading (usually as a filter though). it's just another momentum oscillator of course, so probably not much different to the rsi you mention. in any case, divergences at key levels would be something to explore, especially in ranges. check them out around the full day value area on the 1000t with a target back to vwap or the poc (whichever gives a sensible rr) on nq, easy to view by pulling up the 'developing va' tool in ninjatrader's orderflow tools (if you use it). as you read the charts more, you'll probably learn to see those divs print in price before the oscillator gives you the signal (hence the filter bit above), just double top/wedge type events at the end of the day.](/r/daytrading/comments/ul3e4v/any_of_yall_have_success_using_keltner_bands_to/i7t2eyg/)

[for example, a 200 day moving average is normally pretty solid support. that support has nothing to do with the 200 day moving average itself being significant.  a 200 day moving average is only significant because many traders chose to display a 200 day ma on their graph. once a critical number of people decide to make that moving average a buy point, the stock bounces off it.  if there aren‚Äôt a critical number of traders buying at that line on their chart, the price drops below.  statistics are the same‚Ä¶ if we read that 9 out of 10 times stock prices drop when interest rates rise, it will come true once a critical number of traders believe stock prices are going to decline and they pull out their money in an attempt to beat others to the selling.  the indicators and statistics themselves do not mean anything significant.   the more you read and hear about a future stock market crash, the more likely it‚Äôll happen because more people believe it   edit: the guys and girls on cnbc say $125 is a buy point because they want everyone else to also think $125 is a buy point and buy.  often the guests on cnbc pay to get on tv](/r/stocks/comments/ukldms/how_far_do_you_think_msft_and_aapl_could_fall/i7qs015/)

[i know a lot of investors are excited about the aapl car and have often bid up aapl stock price whenever there's headlines like this. but i honestly think that at the end of the day the apple car project will be nothing but a giant waste of money that will probably never return any kind of profit. i mean, consider this:  * there's a lot of new ev companies out there, but only 1 of them has ever achieved consistent profitability, tesla, and it took them well over 10+ years to do that.   * apple is jumping into the ev market very late. they don't even have a single car factory, they haven't even announced a car model that they'll bring to the market in the distant future. the competition meanwhile that previously ignored ev's is collectively throwing in tens of billions of dollars into ev/battery research each year. point being by the time apple is finally ready to bring an ev to market there will be a ton more competition in the space then there is today.  * apple's brand is realistically not going to help them much at selling cars. tesla's brand is already basically the apple of the car space, in that they get a ton of free advertising in social media, and people see them as the #1 premium ev automaker. if the average person wants the best ev they'll probably look at tesla, just as if someone wants the best smartphone they'll probably look at apple because of their reputation in that space. this point goes back to the 2nd point somewhat, in that apple's brand would have been a lot more helpful at selling cars if they hadn't given tesla such a huge head start now that they're selling several hundred thousand cars a quarter.  about the only way i can see the apple car division ever returning a profit for investors in a reasonable time period is if apple can solve level 5 self driving multiple years before anyone else. but given all the competition in that space, and all the money being thrown at that problem, plus all the secrecy about their progress, i think it's impossible to really say who can solve level 5 self driving, or when they'll solve it.](/r/stocks/comments/ukq1d0/apple_hires_31year_ford_veteran_to_ramp_up/i7qv1ww/)

1652117908,"i'm noticing an interesting pattern to this conversation: you'll state that the zygote is not a individual human life because of reason x, i'll respond to reason x and you'll reply by stating that whether a zygote is an individual human life is immaterial to the abortion debate. i'll respond by explaining why i brought it up (namely that people were claiming a zygote isn't even human, much less a person, and that's factually incorrect) and you'll reply by claiming it is not a human life because of reason x. we're going in circles and i don't think it's really worth either of our time.

i do want to make it clear, however, that when you say that the zygote being the first stage of human life is ""flatly wrong"", or ""evidently false in some cases"" (which implies it's true in others, which is a weird claim to make), or that ""conception is not the ""obvious"" initial developmental stage to associate with an individual human"" you are going against the establishment scientific position. if you or anyone else says a zygote is not a human life you're making a claim similar in kind to saying that the earth is 12,000 years old: you can find scientists who will agree with you, but you're clearly going against the scientific consensus.

some receipts on that:

the [encyclopedia britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/zygote) says the following: ""the zygote represents the first stage in the development of a genetically unique organism.""

the textbook [concepts of biology](https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/24-6-fertilization-and-early-embryonic-development/) states that ""the development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the blastula."" as does the textbook [the developing human](https://eu-ireland-custom-media-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ukmeaeu/esample/9780323611541-sample-chapter.pdf) which states ""human development is a continuous process that begins when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (spermatozoon) from a male to form a single-celled zygote."" [*human biology*](https://bio.libretexts.org/bookshelves/human_biology/book%3a_human_biology_(wakim_and_grewal)/23%3a_human_growth_and_development/23.2%3a_germinal_stage) states that ""the germinal stage of development is the first and shortest of the stages of the human lifespan. the germinal stage lasts a total of eight to nine days. it begins in a fallopian tube when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm to form a zygote (day 0)."" those were just the textbooks that are available online and could be googled in 10 minutes, but you can find the same fact stated in just about all textbooks on biological human development. if you can find a textbook that says otherwise, please provide a source.

columbia university [defines](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/humandev/2004/introduction.pdf) a zygote as ""a diploid cell resulting from fertilization of an ovum (mature female germ cell) by asperm. a zygote is the beginning of a new human being.""

and here's a [pile of quotes](https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html) saying the same thing:

""embryo: an organism in the earliest stage of development; in a man, from the time of conception to the end of the second month in the uterus.""

\[dox, ida g. et al. the harper collins illustrated medical dictionary. new york: harper perennial, 1993, p. 146\]

""the development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""

\[langman, jan. medical embryology. 3rd edition. baltimore: williams and wilkins, 1975, p. 3\]

""zygote. this cell, formed by the union of an ovum and a sperm (gr. zyg tos, yoked together), represents the beginning of a human being. the common expression 'fertilized ovum' refers to the zygote.""

\[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. before we are born: essentials of embryology and birth defects. 4th edition. philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1993, p. 1\]

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed""

\[o'rahilly, ronan and mÔøΩller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29. (p. 12}\]

""almost all higher animals start their lives from a single cell, the fertilized ovum (zygote)... the time of fertilization represents the starting point in the life history, or ontogeny, of the individual.""

\[carlson, bruce m. patten's foundations of embryology. 6th edition. new york: mcgraw-hill, 1996, p. 3\]

now you are free to ask why this is relevant to the larger abortion debate. perhaps it is irrelevant. but it is relevant to the question of whether the zygote, the embryo, or the fetus is human. it unquestionably is. to say otherwise is to make a claim akin to flat-earthism. if that fact is irrelevant to the larger debate (which it very well may be!) then why are you fighting so hard against it? why not just admit the fact that abortion ends a human life and then make the very reasonable argument that it's not a meaningful human life, or that it's a human life that lacks the qualities we value, that it's not a person, heck even that it's not a citizen! why continue to make preposterous claims about human development?",2,,FlyingLionWithABook,0

1652123982,"i've actually got this one on my computer right now. my spreadsheet takes in the information of: how much each paycheck is, how many hours i worked each week, and how many days i worked each week. it uses this to give me: total pay up to that week throughout the year, average days per week worked, average hours per week worked, average pay per week and average pay per day (for a given week and as a total).

&amp;#x200b;

make a spreadsheet that goes to column ac, set columns a, c, e, i, k, m, o, s, u, w, y, aa, and ac to minimal width, and use format &gt;&gt; conditional formatting while these columns are highlighted together to tell these cells ""is empty"" then black background (also do one for when cells ""is not empty"" then black background, just to keep them black).

&amp;#x200b;

copy one of these eternal black cells and paste it across line 2, then make line 2 as short as possible. add in view &gt;&gt; freeze &gt;&gt; 2 rows to keep the top 2 rows always in view when scrolling. set the remaining cells visible in line 1 as date (column b) / pay (column d) / hours (columns f-h) / per hour (column j) / total (column l) / average (column n) / avg hrs (columns p-r) / avg pay (column t) / days (column v) / avg days (column x) / per day (column z) / avg per day (column ab)

&amp;#x200b;

highlight columns d, j, l, n, t, z, and ab and use format &gt;&gt; number &gt;&gt; currency to get the data in these columns to appear as dollar values down to the cent. highlight column b and use format &gt;&gt; number &gt;&gt; date to set those cells to a physical date format.

&amp;#x200b;

column b is the date of pay, so manually enter the first date for your sheet in cell b3, then in b4 use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(b3+7)

&amp;#x200b;

copy this phrase in b4 and paste it all the way down column b, and it should update each cell's reference in position (b4 references b3, the cell directly above, so b5 will reference b4 as it is directly above b5, etc).

&amp;#x200b;

columns d, f, h, and v will be manual entry cells and can be left alone for this part. column g can be filled with : in every cell (it may ask you to accept as ': due to coding, accept it and it will post as just : in each cell).

&amp;#x200b;

use column i to start turning the time into something usable in excel by referencing total minutes in terms of hours. start with cell i3, use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(h3/60)

&amp;#x200b;

this will turn 30 minutes into 0.5 hours. now go to cell e3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(f3+i3)

&amp;#x200b;

this creates a single cell with the total hours per week as a decimal value. if your total time for a week was 20 hours and 45 minutes, you use cells f and h in that pay's line as 20 (column f) and 45 (column h), and the math calculated in columns e and i will turn column e's cell for the line into 20.75 for additional math. copy cell e3's phrase down column e, and do the same with cell i3 down column i.

&amp;#x200b;

now to figure out average pay per hour for the week. in cell j3, use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(d3/e3)

&amp;#x200b;

to math out the average pay per hour for that given week (total pay for the week in d3 divided by total hours for the week in e3). copy this phrase down column j.

&amp;#x200b;

for total pay, go to l3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(l2+d3)

&amp;#x200b;

l2 will be blank, but the first cell will equal the value of d3 for total pay. copy the phrase down column l, and each entry will take total pay as of last week and add on this week's pay for the new yearly total.

&amp;#x200b;

this is where things get a little tricky. in column n, we math out average pay per week. start with cell n3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=average($d$3:d3)

&amp;#x200b;

this allows the sheet to figure the average pay per week, but the scale of cells referenced for the total changes with each entry. when you copy and paste this phrase down column n, each entry with start with $d$3 for its range and end in that line's entry for column d. the use of $ locks the reference point (using $d3 and moving the pasted copy left or right changes the line number, and using d$3 and moving the pasted copy up or down changes the column letter, but using $d$3 locks it in as d3 for all instances of the copied data).

&amp;#x200b;

columns p-r are set to be a time total like columns f-h, so you can go ahead and make all cells in column q appear as : ahead of time. in cell o3, use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=average($e$3:e3)

&amp;#x200b;

to figure out the average hours total up to that point in time. then, in cell p3, use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=trunc(o3)

&amp;#x200b;

to cut down the total to only the total hours from cell o3's total. now, go to cell s3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(o3-p3)

&amp;#x200b;

to get the fractional amount of hours remaining, then go to cell r3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(s3\*60)

&amp;#x200b;

to get that time returned to whole minutes. copy and paste o3-s3 all the way down.

&amp;#x200b;

now to look at how much you're averaging each week. go to cell t3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(n3/o3)

&amp;#x200b;

to math out average pay per week divided by average hours per week. copy cell t3 down column t.

&amp;#x200b;

column v, as mentioned before, will be manual entry for how many days you worked each week.

&amp;#x200b;

column x tells us how many days, on average, we work each week. go to cell x3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=average($v$3:v3)

&amp;#x200b;

to math out the average days worked each week, and then copy that into the rest of column x.

&amp;#x200b;

in column z, we break this down to average pay per day in a given week. in cell z3, use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(d3/v3)

&amp;#x200b;

to figure out total pay for the week divided by total days worked that week for average pay per day.

&amp;#x200b;

finally, column ab will tell us the overall total pay per day. first, we need to add each total of days worked for each week, so go to cell u3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum($v$3:v3)

&amp;#x200b;

to add up the total days worked up to that week. now go to cell ab3 and use the phrase

&amp;#x200b;

=sum(l4/u4)

&amp;#x200b;

to take the total pay for the year to that point divided by the total days worked for the year to that point. copy cell u3 down column u, and copy cell ab3 down column ab.",3,,ChronoCritic,0

do you see the delusional pattern you are following? you can't take the l and move on because of your enormous ego. i'm right and i'm always going to be right! even if my arguments are based on thin air!!! 

you still have no argument about the utility of bitcoin because there is none. you keep sending articles that concludes nothing or that speculate about the future of cryptocurrency, because at the end there is no real argument that goes in favor of bitcoin. how so you may ask?

it was created to sostitute the dollar and make something accessible to the entire world as a currency, it failed to do so because of it's volatility. you can't make a currency but at the same time an investment product, it's like using apple stock as currency, it just doesn't work. but wait the third world countries!!! not everyone has internet and a computer, or even electricity. but wait corruption in usa, central banks are evil!!! banks around the world have a position in bitcoin because it can't be used as a collateral, to hide money essentially. 

bitcoin and other crypto are trying to find a problem in which they would be useful, they tried nfc payments and the hype got demolished because of the fees. the tried nfts and they realized how they were used as scams and also because they were useless. 

a dude i saw in this thread said a very interesting thing: you in fact sell bitcoin to get real money, let that sink in.

1652216287,"this is a copy/paste of a post i made about a year ago:

lots of people here don't understand bonds and advise others to just stick with stocks, don't listen to them.

here's what you need to know. 

first, most bonds  (excepting us treasuries) trade more like used cars than stocks. each trade is unique and not exactly comparable. because of this, bond traders are specialized. if you just put in an order and try to buy a few thousand dollars worth of a specific bond, you are going to overpay by a substantial amount. you need to be buying round lots ($100k worth) and know what you are doing to get a good price. because of this, most retail investors should avoid buying individual bonds (except treasuries) and stick with bond funds.

there's many many more types of bonds than stocks in the us. there's one aapl stock, but they probably have a dozen different types of bonds. every city, county, school district, hospital, etc issues multiple types of bonds.

all the research saying passive investing (index funds) beats active investing is about stocks, not bonds. people just assume it's the same, but it's not. you'll make more in an actively managed bond fund than in an index bond fund.

most bonds will have lower volatility and lower returns than typical stocks, but this can be adjusted up with leverage. an easy way to invest in these are with cefs, which often use leverage.

here's the total returns for pdi, a bond cef over the past eight years: 12%,20%, 6%, 18%, 19%, 8%, 23%, -9%, and (ytd in 2021) 13%. because a large part of the total returns are paid out in distributions, it's best to reinvest the dividends and hold them in a tax advantaged account.

if you are in a high tax state, (ca, for example), and in a high tax bracket, it makes sense to be in a state specific municipal bond fund. one example is pcq for california. this muni bond cef currently has a yield of 4.18% tax-free, which is the equivalent of about 8% taxable. i have about a third of my taxable account in these types of investments, because i'm quite happy to take a near certain 8%.

i think everyone should have exposure to bonds. anyone who puts 100% of their money in a single asset class really just doesn't know what they are doing. there's many types of bonds, but for some reason lots of  people here think there's one bond that yields 1% annually, and they advised avoiding that.",3,,ron_leflore,0

1652285638,"that gets tricky because it is decentralized . like take this example, you have 200 shares of msft stock in a brokerage. now that brokerage fails, the back ups fail, the brokerage burns down and all the paper records fail, the offset backups fail.

so it may take a while to sort out but that 200 shares of msft stock still exists, the transfer agent sees that this brokerage held x amount of stock (now the transfer agent doesn't know what customers it belongs to) but point being that stock still exists , and now you have the process figuring out who actually owned it and you can in theory get the stock back. the stock just doesn't disappear into the void if the brokerage fails. the sec/sipc or the court can go to the transfer agent and say ""give sirglass 200 shares of microsoft as he owned it in the failed brokerage and just put it in his name""

however lets say i have 50k of crypto at an crypto brokerage ; it goes down and the keys and password go down with it. or it gets hacked and crypto is sent to off to other wallets.

the court or goverment cannot go to ""bitcoin"" and say send those coins back, or put 2 coins in sirglass's wallet; so now are they on the hook for the monitary value? this is very different than stocks , basically sipc will insure your ownership rights(not the value) , you cannot really do that with crypto",11,,SirGlass,0

brk's holding don't actually reflect brk stock price.

brk is the holding company essentially that owns all of x branded stocks and x branded businesses. some of the stocks go up, some of the stocks go dow and some of the brk's companies aernt even public. such as acme brick and geico.

price action and even dividends don't affect the stock price for brk.a or brk.b

however, the trust everyone has in buffett is what props the stock price up as well as he actual $ amount of brk's investment portfolio. everyone who invests in brk is aware of price action on stocks and understand that's the underlying investments brk owns, more than likely will recover and the brk company will sustain itself and produce greater returns in the future.

often people do it to trim bad investments that are losing to offset taxes for good investments that are gaining. 

the downside is if you're *harvesting* a good, but underperforming investment that turns around you could miss out on key gains that would have been realized if you just held the asset. you need to make sure you're putting those funds to another asset that you're confident will outperform what you're selling in the first place.

even if meta goes back up again and i'm only down $300 or something, that just means less of a tax write-off. it would have to go back above my initial investment to actually make me money and that might take years at this point.

however, if i trade my $$ in meta stock for doge, i can get the $600 write-off and then any $$ i make on doge (or any other stock/crypto i invest in) is profit. the way i see it, if i keep my meta and i gain $300 (-$600 to -$300) i'm still down $300, but essentially 0 with the write-off. if i sell my meta though and the stuff i buy with the money gains $300, i'm up $300 with a $600 write-off that offsets my loss. $0 vs $300. is this right or am i understanding this wrong?",1,,InfiniteBreadstick,0

edit: talked to a financial advisor.  apparently tv and online advertisements for investments fall under caveat emptor, which basically means ""buyer beware"" and anyone buying a service or investment has the personal responsibility to ensure that it is on the up and up when engaging in that transaction.  still, seeing a team promote this kind of thing gives me a slimy feeling.",29,,BaseballsNotDead,0

your view of markets as gambling vehicles is somewhat true, whether it's stocks or other. it's all just confidence in success and balancing risk of that success. i'm guessing this is your first couple years in crypto so yes, most projects that are shit (most projects) will drop 99+% and never recover. overall it takes less value to move a smaller market, that's why crypto is more volatile.

1652381322,"i have a hard time believing in ""financial advisors""; i've met quite a few bad actors over the years trying to hawk something they needed to offload.  **i more or less trained myself and use fidelity for my 401k and roth.**  research companies through there, etc.  fidelity has a lot of great information without the marketing goop.  i have a good balance of tech, medical, bonds and government sector. 

the hardest part is to **not be squeamish**.  **the market is tanking right now.**  all of it.  no sector is safe, *but it will recover*.  if you go the route of personal investing, i suggest you look to put a fair portion of your funds in a **us bond market**.  when bush ii was in office and 9/11 hit, the market took a dive.  i was able to salvage my portfolio with bonds and (at that time) petroleum stocks.  we are currently a world with a war raging - the government sector will remain strong (general dynamics, for example).  

*just a note -* and this is not insider trading, but common knowledge on the investment sites - **google is about to offer a 20-for-1 stock split.**  meaning that if you have 1 share of google stock on july 1, on july 15, they will issue you 19 more.  of course, the value of those 20 will be what one share is today, just spread over the 20 shares, but... the last stock split was a couple years ago, and the stock soared up to where it is now within a couple of years.  at the moment, that is my long game on investments.  

lastly, find a company you may have a passion for.  if you own an iphone, look at apple stock. same for microsoft!  if you like a media company, look at like nexstar or disney.  if you are concerned about the company overall, look to the human rights campaign website for companies who have great records on diversity.  you will be surprised how fast you can build your portfolio for your interests and not something someone is trying to sell you.  

good luck!",1,,[deleted],0

1652382167,$aapl getting a haircut...üôÉ..nasdaq bear!!,1,,ArchitectureMaster,0
1652382473,"&gt; it‚Äôs not the same. btc is now tied to the stock market due to futures and crypto portfolios offered by brokers. 

that doesn't mean that btc is ""tied"" to the stock market in any real way. 

apple stock is somewhat ""tied"" to the price of raw materials and chip manufacturing because these things will inherently affect the cost of making iphones... 

brokers offer all sorts of assets that are barely correlated if at all.  

crypto futures &amp; options now allow people to bet against the price of individual cryptos ...  ( i assume there are also crypto ""index"" futures &amp; options ) 

i.e. people can make money on the fall of crypto values... so that's a pretty significant difference.  

on the other hand, without futures and options... you might not see as many ""flash crashes""... 

but it would make the risk of giant bubbles much more likely and then long hard crashes as people sell off their assets , also high likelihood of  ""depressions"" and possibly permanent low values or even becoming completely worthless.  

without options and futures then people can only essentially ""bet"" on the something like bitcoin by buying and holding. 

selling bitcoin isn't really betting against it... it's more like walking away from the poker table and cashing out. 

so if no one can bet against an asset... the price is then only supported by people that want  to buy and hold  the asset ... i.e. people that have some ""belief"" or confidence in that asset

that's how you get a more fragile and likely larger bubble without the ability to bet against the asset .  

when a crash of a ""holders"" bubble starts.... it's more like a phenomenon of formerly like-minded people beginning to change their mind... ( as opposed to options traders ""arguing"" with each other ) 

if enough of these ""like-minded"" people begin to change their mind then panic sets in and you get the equivalent of a run on the bank... 

but with a ""like-minded"" crash it's more like a school of fish all deciding to quickly change direction or disperse after formerly swimming in the same direction together for many years... 

when futures &amp; options.... you at least have the equivalent of a marketplace of ""for"" and ""against"" or bears &amp; bulls constantly trading against each other.... yes you can still get harsh crashes .... but at least there's constant opposing opinions to prevent a long term buildup of only like-minded people that also likely have similar ""faith"" for similar reasons i.e. i think this asset will keep going up...

also these like-minded buyers are the equivalent of a clubhouse full of like-minded people that in that clubhouse because it's making them money... and they aren't hearing anyone arguing against them at all in that clubhouse.. 

then the crash starts via people leaving that clubhouse... as opposed to smaller crashes being initiated by people ""arguing against"" the case for the particular asset

assume these like-minded people, only entered the clubhouse because it was profitable... so when enough people start leaving and the price crashes... it shouldn't be surprising that the clubhouses might completely empty out and that's when you get a depression... or a maybe a possible permanent worthlessness of a particular asset.  

why would any formerly optimistic people ever want to enter that clubhouse again if they just lost all of their money ? ...fuck that clubhouse, it broke my heart...( these people are all likely feeling very scorned by that asset)   

and since there are plenty of other clubhouses to check out that they could make money in, then that asset may never recover again.

yes, the same thing can happen with futures &amp; options trading implemented... you are just not getting an entire asset who's value built up by groupthink and like minded optimism with no opposition that had ever caused them to experience losses previously...

 i suppose it's also like the difference between a stress-tested bridge vs. a bridge that's never actually been tested and was built by optimistic engineers that have a financial incentive to be cheer lead for that bridge without any debate allowed...",2,,DismalEconomics,0

1652384568,"&gt;however, i maintain that the funding of a corporation (through equity and fixed income) nevertheless originates with individuals, not the state. the vast majority of apple shares are owned by individuals through diversified funds.

you are getting confused about stock ownership and corporate finance. the bond market is where the funding for corporations comes from. the stocks are portions of the company divided up and sold to individuals or investments funds.

apple stock shares: 16.91%

vanguard 7.33%

berkshire hathaway 5.44%

blackrock 4.14%

&amp;#x200b;

lets take a look at fed etf holdings for a second.

vanguard intermediate-term corporate bond etf 9,356

vanguard short-term corporate bond etf 6,785

who runs the fed's debt buying program?

blackrock.

blackrock‚Äôs ishares has 38.1% of the exchange-traded product market; vanguard has 26.5%

this is just a small portion. the entire corporate bond market is heavily regulated and funded by these preferred lending institutions, or the frs banks that lend money to the corporations. they are not buying the stocks of the company they are lending short and long term debt to the corporations. this debt comes from the printing press. they (the corporations who receive these funds) can use this debt for stock buy back increasing the stock price.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;there is a rich history in the western world of 'free' persons risking their own wealth in businesses long before the advent of the business entities that we know today

agreed. this does not make a corporation though.

&gt;you voluntarily chose to engage in a transaction with microsoft corp- not mr. gates. you are actually in a better position to collect on damages as a litigant-plaintiff if the defendant is a large corporation than an individual, ceterus paribus.

i'm not talking about voluntarily doing business with microsoft. (this would be handled in a contract for arbitration if something where to go bad.) lets say gates is in a hurry to his business meeting. he is operating in the capacity of an employee of microsoft. he wrecks into my car, i am forced to sue ms and not bill gates who is the one who did the damage.",1,,NotNotAnOutLaw,0

let's talk about housing. home prices up 18.4% y/y. do you think that median wages have followed that line? what happens when everyone's adjustable-rate mortgage they took out against their stocks go up 2-3%? or they can't afford their cc payment because food and energy costs have soared and they start to skimp their mortgages? default rates up

1652460303,"there's not many different ways i can say this. 

it would be in opposite realtive to the asset. not as a whole. that is the most important distinction.  if the change was in absolute value, a gain in apple stock would inherently make milk cost more dollars. that's not how it works.

if there are supply chain issues for milk that's a type of inflation technically reducing the value of the dollar, but that doesn't mean  lumber is also increasing at the same rate, it very well may be 10% for milk and 6% for lumber because there are different factors causing the problems. 
other factors can reduce the value of the dollar as a whole, like printing, but that effect is not inherent to the price of any one asset changing. 

imagine the dollar is an elevator constantly moving, and the prices of individual goods are people jumping up and down inside the elevator and things like printing move the elevator as a whole. the goods can move up and down independently of the elevator, but still with it overall for long haul. they don't really have a say on where the elevator ends up.

what your doing is confusing the fluctuations of the people inside of the elevator with the movements of the elevator as a whole. conceptually, inflation is a reduction in your spending power, but inflation does not have to be uniform across all goods. therefore if milk is more expensive, it doesn't mean there was an absolute reduction in the value of the dollar. the elevator could very well be parked.",1,,glasswallet,0

1652463655,"typo i meant cheaper.

it absolutely is a seperate bag. a change in the price of goods or assets does not change the absolute value of currency or the cost of other goods. you're confusing literally cheaper in dollars with conceptually cheaper realtive to the stock. you can't trade stock for milk. you have to change it dollars first. 

$1 = 1aapl

$1 = milk 

1aapl = milk 

stock increase 

$1 = 0.5 aapl

$1 = 1 milk 

1 aapl = 2 milk

---------------------------
the absolute value of the dollar did not change. 
the buying power of dollars realtive to the stock did, but it's insulated from everything else. that illustrates the inflation of assets. unless you're buying milk with stocks, your buying power did not increase. there no reason to say milk got cheaper because you don't do that. if you're a guy that never has any involvement with apple stock, you didn't notice a difference. 

heres the same thing but with money supply driven inflation. which is entirely different. 

$1 = 1aapl

$1 =  1milk 

1aapl = 1 milk 

printers start

$1 = 0.5 aapl

$1 = 0.5 milk 

1 aapl = 1 milk

1652463943,"both are potentially examples of the greater fool theory, in which a person can make money off overvalued assets. any asset could be overvalued including apple stock. however, with stocks, it's much clearer that there could be a path toward it actually being worth its asking price in the future (e.g. amazon's high price in 2010 may be justified by the profits it earns in 2022). with crypto, especially these little projects like the ""box token"" in the video or memecoins, it's a lot harder to claim that there is potentially inherent value in the asset in the future. the value comes from the prediction that greater fools exist, though the investors often don't think of it this way.

1652484313,"ponzi scheme - old investor get rich by taking money from new investors till the last round of investors who get nothing back.

stock markets - investors get rich from the business. the cash flow entirely comes from profit making activities of that business.

it's possible for every investor of the business to end up richer. it's impossible for everyone in crypto to get richer. your money can only come from some new person investing more money than you and it'll always result in some people taking losses or last round of owners not able to find any buyers at all.

if i invest 10 and get out at 100, someone must've put 100 in. if that guy gets out at 1000, some third person must have put 1000 into the crypto. eventually, the investment will stop growing because no one has an infinite amount of money. still, every single penny is coming from some other investor's pocket.

the stock market does have a secondary market where people play on fluctuation and speculations, but it's just the superficial level. the core value is still coming from businesses able to make profits and give dividends. that's why netflix and meta stock dropped like shit when their earning and growth reports came out and their expected profitability ended up being lower than what was commonly accepted.",1,,quick20minadventure,0

1652496464,"yes they are.  a typical company with shares on some exchange - apple for example - employs many people (employment drives economic output) , and sells widgets and services to other peiople and companies (generates revenue and maintains supply chains).  if i buy apple stock it's not solely because i look at how much stock is sold and the value and decided i need to get in....yes there is a decision that may be partly driven by fomo, but it is backed by (or at least any intelligent person will support it with) knowledge of the company's economic health.  i know that the health of the company or the surrounding economy may affect the share price, because others are doing the same.

when i was mining and buying crypto, there was no such connection to real economic value.  decisions are ostensibly made primarily based on ""it's new, its popular, it promises a new bc tech to solve a problem, etc"" - which are shallow reasons, to be sure, with no connection to national or global economies... but even worse, everyone knows in their heart that even those reasons aren't really able to provide confidence, and that there is nothing to prevent the rug being pulled at any time, so you just need to make sure you're not the last out.   this is why fud is so devastating... because it is perceived to cause the rug pull, which is probably, in fact, inevitable (and seemed to take place for every bc fork).  anytime stock investment is treated in the way crypto is treated, you wind up with criminal charges (see jordan belfort). 

i think the bc concept is technically a brilliant solution to meet the implicit requirements that nakamoto was working with.  but the full requirements were not properly formed perhaps, and would have needed to take into account addition into existing economies, as well as connection to real economic output...so that the tech is somehow not fully useful as a currency.  as a decentralized, digital accounting system... ok.  maybe if everyone decided to switch to it at once it might work, so it had real economic backing.  but in its current form it seems to me to have economic penetration about equivalent to a credit card rewards points system.  any speculation, such as it exists, is based largely on the dream that one or another currency will be wholesale adopted... which is unlikely since it is not without environmental impact.  moreover, any adoption may need to take place almost all at once, otherwise anyone with large buying power can pull the rug out at any time and there is no backing to protect it.

now when we start talking about options trading, things get a bit more difficult to parse and contrast.  

but all of this is outside my wheelhouse anyway, just the perspective of someone who has been involved in and following crypto tech for a few years, has been managing my own investments and even done a bit of options trading (although only the safest options with risk limits), and has done admittedly the bare minimum of thought on it because i have a life and career outside of it.  so the standard disclaimer, some or all of it could be wrong, don't base any financial decisions on my opinions here, etc, etc.",1,,Raskolnikovs_Axe,0

1652515615,"you should be scared.

i'll try and help you out.

first off, don't ever put money into investments that you can't afford to lose.

but second, how can you tell a good investment from a fraudulent one?

&gt; i follow the general principle of having 60% in btc/eth and the rest in stablecoin/altcoin but i‚Äôm still wondering how we can smell bullshit even on giants like luna

here's the basic recipe for a lot of scams in the crypto space:

it's something called a ""ponzi scheme"".

this is something where someone pretends like they are giving you a really good investment opportunity. they claim there will be massive growth, and they offer to let you put money into this investment.

now, in a real investment, there's something that you're investing in that's actually generating real value - for example, microsoft makes operating systems, microsoft office, provides it support to companies, sells video games, etc. when you invest in microsoft stock, you are investing in a company that is producing real products that people buy. this is how it generates value, and rises in price.

in a ponzi scheme, however, there is no value generation. the company or product you are investing in doesn't actually generate any value at all. it claims to be rising in value constantly, but there's no product or service on offer other than selling shares (or in the crypto space, ""coins"" or ""tokens"" or whatever else).

what is *actually* going on is that they are essentially getting people to put money into a box. this box can never hold more money than is put into it, because it isn't generating any value. as such, the only way for there to be more money in the box is by drawing in more suckers to put money into the box. any person who gets out of the box will be discouraged from leaving the box - typically by offering them some sort of fake money equivalent in the box, or added investment opportunities inside the box, instead of pulling their money out of the box.

the reason for this is that the box can never contain more money than it started with, and the person or people running the scam are pulling money out of the box. they are claiming very high returns on the money in the box, so anyone who pulls money out of the box is going to be pulling out a lot more than they put in. the higher the supposed ""gains"", the worse this is, because it means that there may be a lot less money in the box.

when the box is empty - when there's no more money in it - and someone tries to pull their money out, the people running the scheme will refuse. it is at this point that the whole thing collapses, because there's no money left in the box.

it doesn't matter what the supposed ""value"" of the asset is in the box - what matters is how much money is actually put into the box. that is the actual maximum amount of value that is in there, and it can never be more than was put in, and will usually be less.

now, sometimes it is possible for an early adopter into a ponzi scheme to make money by pulling out before the scheme collapses. however, past a certain point of imaginary value, it is too late - because the whole thing is a fraudulent scheme.

the major signs of a ponzi scheme are:

1) something that isn't selling any sort of product, just shares in something, or ""coins"", or whatever else, without any actual product attached to it.

2) something that is ""too good to be true"" - anything that promises very high yields, or promises that it can ""only go up"".

3) something that pretends to be a ""safe investment""  that you can't lose money on.

all of these things are ways to con people. no investment is ever absolutely safe, no one can promise that it can only go up, and anything that isn't selling any actual product or service has no means of generating additional value.

now, you might be like ""wait a second, isn't that like, literally every single cryptocurrency ever?""

to which i'd reply, ""why yes, that sounds like literally every single cryptocurrency ever, because *literally the entire cryptocurrency market is a ponzi scheme*.""

here's how the ponzi scheme works:

you buy bitcoin or ethereum or some similar thing using usd.

you then sell bitcoin to buy other cryptocurrencies, typically tether, sometimes some other stablecoins, or sometimes other coins directly, via various cryptocurrency exchanges.

now, the person who you buy these coins from then sells out in usd.

the only way for you to get usd, then, is to find some other person to buy the product at a higher price than you bought it for - because, remember, no value is being generated here. you don't have some product to sell, while you keep ownership of the company, like you would with microsoft. literally the only thing of value is the coin you bought - but because it cannot generate value, the only way for it to be worth more is if someone is willing to buy in for a higher price than you did.

so, we can already see the start of a ponzi scheme here. but it gets worse.

first off, these coins are constantly being generated in the market. the way that they are generated is by miners - these people are burning electricity (negative value!) to generate these coins. they don't put any money into the box - all their costs are external to the box, paid to the power company. so when they sell the coin, the actual value of the coin is (cost of coin - cost of power to mine coin). while this isn't exactly fraud, you can see that this means that the box, even absent fraud, is generating *negative* value, and they're selling something that produces no value but incurs costs to produce - already super sketchy.

but this pales in comparison to the most impressive form of fraud - stablecoins.

see, a stablecoin purports to be a coin that is backed by some amount of currency (typically $1 usd).

but *think* about it. why would you ever have a stablecoin when you could just have $1 usd? it's literally the exact same value!

there's two main reasons:

1) whatever you're doing with the stablecoin is illegal to do with usd (already a huge red flag).

2) **it's not actually backed by $1 usd, but less than that, and possibly nothing.**

people will claim about it being ""easier"" to move around these coins, but if you have ever had a brokerage account with a bank, you know that spending money from a brokerage account is dead easy. real banks can do this without issue.

but of course, we aren't dealing with real banks. in fact, a lot of these exchanges - particularly the derivatives ones - don't operate in the us because *it is literally illegal for them to do so*. the single largest exchange does not operate in the us because that would expose them to us financial regulations;

and that should tell you, right away, that they are not even remotely safe to do business with.

what is really going on here is the ponzi scheme in action.

remember how i mentioned that a ponzi scheme wants you to keep your ""money"" in the scheme, because the amount of money in the box can never exceed the amount of money put into the box?

this is how they do it - they convince you that these ""stablecoins"" have real value, and are equivalent to dollars. in this way, they keep everyone from pulling their money out of the market, because once they did, they'd realize that these supposed gains aren't really there.

but okay, so how is it that all these coins are supposedly ""skyrocketing"" in value?

well, first off, people buying in at higher valeus.

but secondly, they're printing these ""stablecoins"" like *crazy*.

these coins have nothing backing them (or very tiny amounts backing them) so you can pretty much make as much as you want.

and that's exactly what has been going on.

**tether has made up over 70% of the market in crypto for years now.** and tether and its parent company aren't allowed to do business in the state of new york because the state of new york investigated them and found out that they don't actually back up their ""stablecoin"" with real money.

1652533480,"what exactly do you consider this great golden age of balance to be then? certainly not at launch. pyro and engie lacked core parts of their kit that help them be competitive with other classes. spy was even more buggy and unreliable. soldier and demo's primaries were even stronger than they are now; especially given the choke heavy hellholes the launch maps are.

and all the other classes have the same exact problems they do now anyways. scout can be heavily dependent on the gamemode. heavy is too niche to see general use. medic has always been designed to be the most overpowered, overcentralizing class in the game on purpose since day one. and sniper can still instakill because they crossed a sightline for a quarter of a second.

sure, there are some stupid borderline useless weapons in the game, but that doesn't make a class worse. yet even with all the unlocks, there are hardly any that outperform the standard meta stock options. either you have items like the jag and rescue ranger, which help an underpowered class like engineer keep ground with the meta classes, you have interesting sidegrades that improve the amount of choice and counterplay a class has, or its items like the crusaders crossbow that everybody loves because they add so much more depth to the game. 

very rarely are there actual overpowered items that make the meta classes even stronger. the cow manger (in servers without random crits and engineers)?, mad milk and jarate are super strong, but they don't completely invalidate the other options. the bazaar bargain and the diamond back are kinda unfun i guess? and you do have a point in regards to the scorch shot. not that its overpowered or anything, but its so annoying that the best option would have been to never make it in the first place.

after over a hundred unique items with all the complexity and variety that brings, there are only about a dozen that maybe slightly cause problems in specific circumstances after jungle inferno. unlocks gives many simple classes like scout and heavy alternative supportive roles and utility, gives engie and pyro extreme amounts of depth, gives demo a full hybrid melee subclass, and gives medic one of the most rewarding support roles in any game ever. if you think the game is too unbalanced now, then i have to assume you just havent played in years and years. because the only thing anybody complains about these days is that their favorite weapon *isn't* overpowered anymore.",4,,turmspitzewerk,0

it's the first cryptocurrency.  it's not a copycat.  it'll always be around because people won't just stop using it.  and no, bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value, but other projects do.

ethereum, the one this community hates so much because it uses gpus, is a distributed cloud computing framework, where the eth coins are used to pay for the computational tasks. newsflash: the merge next month isn't going to reduce gpu demand, because cloud computing is the purpose of ethereum.  most altcoins are built on top of ethereum stone it's framework is optimal for running blockchains.

there's other coins with intrinsic value as well.  there's coins for storing files and ensuring they'll always be there (costs to store, but then it's undeletable so long as there's a miner).  stablecoins (scams) are intended to facilitate trading without having to use the existing systems which take 4 days to transfer money.  loopring that i mentioned above is intended to replace banks and stock markets with an automated system that can't be corrupt like wall street is.

on that note,

&gt;like, msft stock has intrinsic value; it reflect share ownership over physical assets and ip, things we can place fair market value on if nothing else.

if stock prices under wall street had anything to do with the physical assets and ip of the underlying company, then went does the entire market trend to be green or red all following the same pattern?

1652550464,"its use case isnt everyday transaction. atleast in a developed world we have many ways to transact which are better like credit card for groceries.

its for the things where conventional transactions are not easy. ill give a few examples.
- after i wrote this post, someone liked it and tipped me 500 satoshis. to do the same with dollars, reddit would have had to let us connect our bank account to the reddit app. thats very difficult for reddit as reddit would have had to get permission in every country to do so. 
- when ukraine wanted donations for the war, all they had to do was write their bitcoin address on twitter and people were able to send bitcoin instantly to help them. it did not matter what country you were from and how the banking rails were in your country.
- i hired a dashboard designer in romania to do some work for me. i paid him in bitcoin for the work. i dont know if its even possible to send 5-10 dollars there and what the fees would have been for that.
- when andreas antonopolous was being bullied by roger ver, supporters of andreas worldwide were able to send small amounts of bitcoin to andreas to make him a millionaire. and no company had to be in the middle to carry these transactions out. 

bitcoin is about transfering value between people irrespective of the country they live in, irrespective of the bank they use, irrespective of if their bank is being sanctioned or not. its like me paying you in gold for something you did. of course you would still need off ramps to cash it out, but you have the option to keep it as it is.

now you would say all cryptos can do that. would you do some work for me if i paid you 10g of copper? no. but you would do it if i sent you the same value in gold. you are more likely to do so, but finally the choice would be yours. thats the argument with other cryptos. 

the romanian worker wouldnt have agreed to being paid in dogecoin or some random shitcoin. alot of the times the money you earn is just saved on not spent. and bitcoin is a great savings tool.

like being paid in apple stock. surely you cant use the apple stock to buy groceries. but still people do it. thats because they expect their apple stock to be worth more in the future. same with bitcoin. apple stock is a security here, but im roughly talking about the practice of ""being paid in kind"".",3,,Ok_Aerie3546,0

1652556412,"if you are overcollaterized by 50% and your collateral drops by 33%, you are now 100% collaterized. if it drops more‚Ä¶

however, there is another problem here, and it is related to liquidity and your ability to extract money from a system.

a stablecoin is supposed to be 100% liquid (as it is cash). if you own 1b of the stablecoin, the expectation is that you can sell all your tokens, get $1b and in the process you haven‚Äôt alter the price of the stablecoin. it doesn‚Äôt matter if i own 0.1%, 1% or 10% of the total supply.

however, other assets are not that liquid. if you own $1m of a stock and decide to sell it, will you get $1m? it depends. are you selling apple stock or stocks for a small business? selling $1m of apple stock will not alter its price, but selling $1m of a small business will do. you may be able to find buyers of 5% of the stock you own at the current price, but as you sell more and more stock, each one will sell for less.

that is why it‚Äôs a mistake to compare the market cap of an algorithmic stablecoin with the market cap of the assets backing it. this is specially bad in the crypto space, where the hold mentality restricts liquidity. if only 5% of the coins are being actively traded while everyone else holds, the moment i need to sell a significant amount of my reserves i can trigger a crash. 

btc and eth have massive market caps, and compared to other coins, there is quite a lot of absolute liquidity available. but relatively wise, it‚Äôs still very small, everyone wants to hold their coins. as a stablecoin growths into billions, it becomes big enough to crash big projects. people were talking about how $1.5b from lfg was driving down the btc price. i‚Äôm not convinced they were actually selling, i would‚Äôve expected a more massive impact on btc price if they had.

so no, over collateralization is not a solution. sure, it will make the event less likely, but as your stablecoin grows, the risks growth too, and eventually, it will crash. it‚Äôs not an if, but a when",3,,Areshian,0

$appl is right now at $147 so you can do this combination of options

* buy 20jan2023 $140 put for $1280
* sell 20jan2023 $155 call for $1310

you earn right now 1310‚àí1280 = $30 dollars and you ensure that you will be able to sell $appl for $140 until jan-2023, no matter what happens. but you also have the obligation to sell $appl at $155 if $appl goes above that.

is a good way of limiting your losses and leaving time for the stock to recover and exit the position with some gains hopefully.

and you keep collecting the dividends during all this time, since you keep your stocks. the broker should understands that the $140 put protects you so it won't ask you more margin for that position even if $aapl goes to $1 (meanwhile you keep the put option). that is true at least with a margin account, not 100% sure if with a cash account the put also offsets the margin.

if you go further on the time you can even get a  better deal. for the jan-2024 options you can sell the $170 call for the same price that the $140 put costs.

this is basically what hedge funds do: hedge the downside by capping the upside. is a good way of preserving capital in turbulent markets

and if the stock crashes a lot you can buy back the short call cheaper and still keep the the protective put, if you think the stock will recover above the short call in the future.",44,,polloponzi,0

he pulls up his information and his jaw just fucking hits the floor. this dude was way in the red, and lost a ton of money. from what he‚Äôd invested. there was a major problem though... at that time the market was doing really well and he should have been up a significant amount, not down. 

 after looking over his account he sees why. the dude was making tons of trades that weren‚Äôt in the customers best interest just to get a commission on the transactions. he was doing things like buying apple, sell it shortly after for no reason, buy a another stock, sell it shortly after for no reason, then buy more apple stock. didn‚Äôt care about the customer‚Äôs retirement just nickel and dining him for commissions on trades. 

he told his boss who basically said ‚Äúi‚Äôll talk to do and so, but don‚Äôt say anything to the client or we will be responsible for the bad trades‚Äù. he went back to his desk, called the client, explained it all, sent him all the relevant documents, advised him to call a lawyer, then sent home and called the scc.

those groups then had the money to buy up assets from metals to stocks to property. so you trying to get a loan at 3-5% sounds really good historically, but when the guy next to you has 8 trillion in cash you have a problem. 

now on top of this the us is seen as a haven for stable money. in new york city up to 30% of all real estate transactions are suspected to be for money laundering or investment only. this is also true to a lesser extent most places in the us.

next you have people like bill gates who borrows against his microsoft stock to buy land (mainly farm land). since he takes a loan it is not income and the interest is a write off. 

next you have south dakota trusts which last i checked have over 600 billion in them. they are a whole special way for the wealthy to protect their money for generations and in some cases launder money for people from other countries.

regarding eth, the point you make of the ourobouros being longer is the biggest misconception i commonly see. i think we can agree to disagree on whether btc is a possible viable currency and whether using it to hedge traditional currency is useful, or not. but back to eth - people transact in eth because those transactions are valuable in and of themselves. there is much more than just buying and selling eth that counts as transactions and it seems you understand this.

where eth transaction are valuable will likely be shown much better in the future. but for example on today's chain, you can create derivative assets that track apple stock. what if you live in a country that doesn't allow access to trading apple stock? you can't participate in speculation on apple. well through custom built vehicles on ethereum, you can now access a market to speculate on apple. you can poke many holes in this (execution risk, smart contract risk, etc) but ultimately the idea is that transactions on ethereum are useful in an of themselves. another example, the red cross used iris scans to identify refugees and disperse aid. if the iris has been scanned previously and aid was provided to that person, that person will be prevented from double dipping. these iris scans were logged to the chain so nobody could go into the back-end database to allow certain persons additional aid. you pay for ethereum transactions because it enables trust. ethereum is the (practically) only decentralized ledger you can access globally for trustless information exchange and audits. this is why transactions on ethereum have value in and of themselves. imagine holding your deed to your house in your personal wallet. imagine holding your credit score in your personal wallet and allowing read access for credit pulls. imagine flood insurance being paid automatically so humans can rebuild their lives much quicker (this is already live on ethereum).

it will take a decade for more use cases to come online. the bet / investment thesis is that eventually the world will need a base layer of trustless information exchange. if ethereum succeeds in its implementation, you will want to own a piece of the network. just like paypal, but without corporate profit taking a share of the network revenue. instead, it all goes to stakers.

that doesn't even get me started on the concept of a dao....

idk to me there is clearly value being created in the ethereum ecosystem. i don't think it's a matter of if, but when these use cases come online. just like the internet in 1998, nobody fully understood what it could enable. people literally called it a fad because they didn't see the business value being created. it seems you are doing the same thing.",1,,iCan20,0

1652674709,your comparison to stocks doesn't make sense. when you buy apple stock you are not buying an iphone. you are buying a percent stake in a company that makes iphones. you are investing in an asset that you think will make you money. it's more comparable to buying fiat currency in different countries. the currencies don't do anything themselves but they facilitate the economy.,5,,sageleader,0
1652676192,"this is not an either/or.  decentralization and regulation are separate axes.  adoption is not even the same axis as regulation (you can have something adopted and unregulated, or regulated to shit that nobody uses).

the terra issue is very unfortunate.  crypto attracts people chasing huge multipliers and makes non-gamblers into gamblers, and gamblers into degenerate ones.

if you are talking about regulation with respect to the terra event, you must be speaking about one of the following

1. coins/projects can't be listed on exchanges without some regulatory vetting
2. people can't use exchanges without some regulatory vetting
3. coins/projects must be able to give some amount of money back to ""investors""
4. stablecoins must be audited, or prove via simulation/back testing that they can hold a peg in various circumstances.  establish a w3c or iso style standards commission.

like that maybe?

\#1 would just be side-stepped - ust/luna/anchor would have been chased onto the dex platforms even if coinbase and friends didn't list.  and anyway, if you open this door, then now regulatory agencies have the power to **delist** coins they don't like.  delisting causes a shock to an ecosystem, while not listing in the first place prevents rapid growth; both can cause death, just in different ways.

\#2 is already in place on central exchanges.  job and salary/net worth aren't yet vetted like they are with some tradfi brokerages, and i don't think that's necessary.

\#3 is not a requirement for regular companies beyond preferential stock holders, so seems unlikely.  it would be impossible for e.g. btc, but even coins with foundations would only have to give *the premine holders* any kind of guarantee, as those would correspond to the initial investors for a company.  you and i have no rights, just like if you buy apple stock today and they declare bankruptcy tomorrow, you don't get a penny back - the initial creditors do, pro-rated.

\#4 i think is realistic.  coins with on-chain functions are exempt, as they are like startup companies with some product/service that is very likely to go bust, and this is well known, so no user protection is necessary.  but stablecoins are advertised to be **stable**, so they should prove it using a well-tested and open source suite of tests, then get a stamp of approval.  users would know to steer clear of those without it.

[i disagree.  age has little to do with it unless you are planning to live on a strict budget and need x amount to stay at that level, then  you have to be conservative and pay attention to dividends.   but being reckless and losing money when you are young is not rational. just think, if donald trump hadn't played fast and loose in the 90's and lost his father's 600 million fortune, and just put it into an index fund or even a money market, he'd be a real billionaire now, maybe even over 20 billion, but he didn't.   point being, every dollar you save or don't lose when you are younger, can be worth a lot more when you are older.  the same applies to squandering money when you are young by partying and living beyond your means, as many young people do, and as i did.  lesson being, always save for a rainy day no matter what your age. and remember that $1000 saved at age 25 can be worth $10,000 by the time you retire.     i squandered about $500,000 between the ages of 25 and 45.  if i had bought aapl instead like i started doing when i was 57, i would have an extra $5,000,000 now at 65.   luckily i did invest a million or more in aapl 10-15 years ago so i got the extra $5,000,000 and am now securely retired but be smart with your money.    and also, always buy during crashes like in 2008 and like we are seeing now, and always sell when cnbc  experts are saying the sky is the limit.   and always have your eyes fixed on the future,. not the past or even the present.  because what a once good investment did last year is completely irrelevant.](/r/stocks/comments/uq8vp3/friendly_reminder_not_everyone_here_is_2030_years/i8pm5x1/)

1652718949,"*15 minute chart*

lmfao that is not proper ta. use daily and weekly charts for your technical charting. rsi is relatively low, and we are due for a bounce. completed second shoulder on the weekly chart puts $aapl ~$152. 

https://imgur.com/gwbmaq3

if you wanted to have a proper reason for why we bounce, there is a bullish doji candle on the daily and we are entering ""oversold"" territory on daily rsi.

but charting and ta are only part of the equation. what does the macroenvironment tell you about the chart?

1652720492, i don‚Äôt think you were in the market in late 2000s if u think apple stock wasn‚Äôt driven by jobs cult..here is a 2010 article from business insider talking about how cultist were driving the price up.. https://www.businessinsider.com/the-cult-of-apple039s-stock-2013-7,7,,Odd_Explanation3246,0
1652721229,"where does the money come from for your transaction fees (i don't mean the coin, i mean the $ that the coin is worth)?  it can come from three sources:

1.  new investors in the coin
2. paid by the people who do the transaction, so basically old investors in the coin who then use it.
3.  venture capital from the initial startup of the coin.

number 1 basically means that the coin is a pyramid scheme, old investors are getting paid from new investors.

number 2 basically means that the coin is a pyramid scheme with different perpetrators and victims.  coin users are paying coin holders, now, you might say this is sort of like visa, but is this system cheaper and better as a payment mechanism than visa?  if i want to benefit from other people's transactions why wouldn't i just buy visa stock?

number 3 do i have to say it?  this money can't last forever, eventually they will rug pull to get their money back.

nothing you said contradicts my original post.  there is no revenue being generated by a business you are all just passing around the initial investments.  the total value of all the algo coins can only increase if more people buy the coins, which is not true for the stock market.",3,,Cornhorn72,0

jay mentioned it on his stream before. i think americans are now buying experiences and not ""stuff"". so i'm bullish on payments, hotels, oil, traveling. so, i don't really care for things like streaming or stay-at-home stocks (including home improvement).

i'm assuming $hd will still beat.  but might guide down and bring the stock down.

1652751309,"this is a good introduction to trading relative vol/pair vol as many quant funds do.

&gt; the upper graph shows iv for ma (green) and v (blue). the lower graph shows us that the iv ratio of v and mv is somewhat mean-reverting. this means that when iv for v is high, we can sell v options and buy (relatively) cheap ma options. we can make the reverse trade when v implied volatility is low.

although, the example you used here is wrong. even when the ratio for $v implied vol / $ma implied vol is high, you won't make money by selling $v vol and buying cheap $ma vol because there was no point in time where $v had a higher iv than $ma.

you would be selling the cheaper vol and buying the more expensive vol instead, which would lose money.

 both of these stocks' implied vols rise and fall exactly with each other. you need a dislocation to happen to profit.",1,,justathrowawaybro1,0

""[the zygote] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. a zygote is the beginning of a new human being. human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. this highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.""

my point is, the implied vol of $ma and $v have a direct (positive) correlation to each other. you cannot profit no matter what number the ratio is because you're going to buy iv on one stock, and sell iv on the other stock and thus you will not profit because vols on both stock precisely rise and fall with each other.

yes and? no one force you to trade on that other exchange, and you could as well sit at the exchange itself(just like happened before) and buy the tape ticker/screen vs waiting for some guy to scream out the price   


it's just faster everything now, but nothing new.  


it's just the same as buying all red toytas in chicago because you notice they are more trendy there than in detroit, but on a faster and bigger scale. but it might be that they also are not getting trendy there, just as in your example there is no liquidity to buy the microsoft stock in chicago. then you sit there with a lot of stock you can not sell at a risk free price  


i understand what you are saying , i just don't agree this is a problem because at most we are talking about a 1-5 cent difference and if not a bot would do it, some fund manager whose job it was to trade would do it. it's just not a feasable thing to solve in my eyes  


\&gt;it is exactly analogous to you opening your wallet, expecting to remove $5 to hand to the first seller to obtain 5 units, but instead, a third party came in, paid the $5 to the seller, obtained the 5 units, then reached into your wallet and took the maximum amount of money you were willing to spend ($10) for those 5 units, and hands you the 5 units and pockets $5 for themself.  


again you seem to be talking about market orders, not limit orders. if i agree to pay 5 for 5 units, we have a contract that must be fulfilled.   


what  you can not understand is that you can as my example above, protect yourself against this. unless you are claiming those hft companies actually wiretapping the connection, and see my order coming in before the stock server itself..?

stop trying to reframe the discussion to focus on where there isn't theft. i am focusing on where there is.

you are literally just victim blaming.

&gt; if you don't want to get taken advantage of, don't participate!

is essentially your argument.

&gt; but it might be that they also are not getting trendy there, just as in your example there is no liquidity to buy the microsoft stock in chicago.

no, that doesn't hold up, because they are going so fast, there is no time to react to the hft, and thus no risk for the hft. the orders already exist and are waiting to be fulfilled. if someone is using the private knowledge of an existing large order being routed to other exchanges to skim the difference off of what already exists as orders on those other exchanges, that is front running. once again, front running is illegal.

hfts are able to make guaranteed profit because they only trade when they see the opportunity to front run existing orders, stepping in front of them and stealing value from the transaction. to put it in terms of your analogy, it's beyond red toyotas being trendy in another city, that other city already has existing orders for red toyotas, meaning there is guaranteed profit.

going back to the scalping analogy, scalping inherently has risk involved because you never know if you will be able to sell your entire inventory.

in this scenario, it is scalping which only takes place when the buyer is already there, money in hand (the existing order which was detected on the first exchange).

1652810542,"seems like you did not understand the argument at all. after 20-60 years you will have way more money if you rent and invest instead of buying. 

a 20% down payment of 100k is money you didn‚Äôt put in stocks. in 30 years, (stocks go up 7% a year on average) you will have 761k.. just on the initial down payment. if you also co tribute 500 dollar a month for those 30 years, you will have 1.3 million. and you will be paying less than a mortgage. 

also, a 500k house over a 30 year mortgage, with 5% interest, will total to 883k‚Ä¶. not to mention you will also be paying property tax each year, at 1.5% that‚Äôs 225k in property taxes‚Ä¶ oh wait, property tax will be higher as your home increases. so it will be at least 300k or more in property taxes. 

then there‚Äôs also price of repairs and maintenance. which is about 10k every five years. so 60k over 30 years. add it all up, and it‚Äôs more profitable to rent and invest in stocks with that down payment and extra cash from not paying interests.

&gt;in august of 1997, apple and microsoft decided to put the past behind them and focus on the future. at that year's macworld event, steve jobs and bill gates announced that the two companies had entered into a historic agreement. in addition to agreeing to a broad patent cross-licensing agreement, microsoft promised to support microsoft office for the mac for 5 years while apple agreed to make internet explorer the default web browser on the mac.

&gt;microsoft also promised to invest approximately $150 million for shares of apple non-voting preferred stock.

...

&gt;microsoft's $150 million investment netted the company 150,000 shares of preferred stock, convertable to common shares of apple stock at a price of $8.25, redeemable after a three year period. by 2001, microsoft had converted all of its shares into common stock, netting the company approximately 18.1 million shares.

&gt;but by 2003, microsoft had sold its entire stake in apple.

1652827859,"for several years now, from her cramped alliance office with a bit of roller derby memorabilia on a shelf above her computer, mazel-carlton has been a leader in running hearing voices network groups and training others to do the same around the country, from augusta, maine, to eureka, calif. h.v.n. originated in the mid-‚Äô80s after a dutch psychiatrist, marius romme, worked with a client, patsy hage, who was hallucinating and suicidal. hage insisted that romme pay attention to the content of her voices instead of dismissing what they said as meaningless. romme went on to study hundreds of people like hage, and in a 1989 paper in schizophrenia bulletin, he argued that practitioners should ‚Äúaccept the patient‚Äôs experience of the voices‚Äù; that ‚Äúbiological psychiatry‚Äù may not be ‚Äúvery helpful in coping with the voices because it, too, places the phenomenon beyond one‚Äôs grasp‚Äù; that practitioners should ‚Äústimulate the patient to meet other people with similar experiences‚Äù; and that patients benefited when they could ‚Äúattribute some meaning to the voices.‚Äù romme‚Äôs paper was mostly ignored, but hearing voices support groups cropped up, especially in britain and across europe. in the united states, it took much longer; some of the first were started by the alliance around 2008, four years before mazel-carlton began working there.  
  
for mazel-carlton, one of the groups‚Äô most essential tenets is that there must be no disabusing anyone of a personal reality. unlike on a psych ward or in many a psychiatrist‚Äôs office, unusual beliefs are not monitored, corrected, constrained. mazel-carlton‚Äôs motto is, ‚Äúif i‚Äôm controlling, i‚Äôm not connecting‚Äù ‚Äî and connection, for her, is everything. it defines hope.  
  
ideally the groups meet in person, but with the pandemic, the movement has turned to zoom, and one day in march, i joined a virtual group that mazel-carlton helps to conduct. the session drew seven people spanning from north carolina to washington state. this particular group focuses on the spiritual, a common theme for people with voices and visions. at the outset, mazel-carlton invited everyone to open up by reminding: ‚Äúthis is where i can go if i have direct experiences of the divine. it‚Äôs a place i can go, if i‚Äôm someone with a psychiatric label, to talk about spirituality without having my experience pathologized. we validate one another here.‚Äù  
  
advertisement  
  
continue reading the main story  
  
a man described being rocked and comforted by ‚Äúan upside-down angel‚Äù when he was growing up. mazel-carlton modeled an h.v.n. principle that prizes curiosity about other realities by asking the man for more about his experience. in reply to another participant, she said, ‚Äúi‚Äôm so sorry that people are refusing to honor your soul‚Äôs identity.‚Äù then a woman talked about visiting her grandmother in a nursing home during covid and seeing her grandmother‚Äôs ‚Äúglowing pink orb rising from her chest‚Äù and everything as ‚Äúsparkling and glowing and timeless.‚Äù  
  
the woman said, ‚Äúeverything was connected; there was this pulse, this flow‚Äù ‚Äî and there was a fight with a nurse when the woman, feeling that she was god, took off her mask. a psychiatrist labeled her psychotic, ‚Äúso i couldn‚Äôt keep telling him my experiences, because he was telling me i‚Äôm sick, and i‚Äôm not sick.‚Äù in this, according to the mainstream view, she was confirming her illness; denial of one‚Äôs diagnosis, termed anosognosia, is seen as a glaring symptom of psychotic disorder.  
  
‚Äúthe first time i came to this group,‚Äù the woman went on, ‚Äúand said something about what happened that day with my grandma, i looked at the screen and people were nodding their heads, and i thought, holy \[expletive\], people get what i‚Äôm talking about. and when people talked about feeling like they‚Äôre jesus christ, i was like, oh, my god, i‚Äôm not the only one? in group, i don‚Äôt feel alone, and feeling alone is like something crushing my chest.‚Äù she began to cry minimally. ‚Äúgroup is a place to be vulnerable,‚Äù she said. ‚Äúin my everyday life, i don‚Äôt feel safe. i have to put on my armor.‚Äù  
  
on a wall next to mazel-carlton‚Äôs desk, there‚Äôs a map of the united states dotted with colored pins. blue pins mark places where she and alliance colleagues have led or arranged for an h.v.n. facilitator training. ‚Äúi sometimes feel like a general mapping the revolution,‚Äù she said. through her zeal, the network had grown from a handful of u.s. groups to 120, though after two years of the pandemic, the number is closer to 100. zoom sessions can‚Äôt match the reassurance and resonance of in-person gatherings.  
  
on the map, red pins represent another campaign. they stand for cities and towns where mazel-carlton and the alliance have conducted trainings in their approach to suicide prevention. the workshops are for prospective founders of support groups ‚Äî and within the groups, as at h.v.n. meetings, clinicians tend to be barred from the room ‚Äî but they are also for practitioners and family members who want a new way to talk with those contemplating suicide.  
  
a slide within the training protocol mazel-carlton has designed teaches that the mission is ‚Äúto stay present‚Äù and not ‚Äúto prevent them from doing that.‚Äù ‚Äústay away from fix-it mode, from savior mode,‚Äù mazel-carlton tells trainees. ‚Äúwith our capes on, we can‚Äôt listen.‚Äù a first principle is that people must be allowed to talk freely about all that is preying on them, including the wish to take their own lives, and in the groups, a foundational pact is that no one will be reported, not to any hotline, not to the police or any practitioner, no matter what he or she expresses an intent to do. to comprehend how thoroughly this defies dominant practice, take the policy of the country‚Äôs most-called ‚Äî and heavily federally funded ‚Äî suicide hotline. it advertises confidentiality but covertly scores risk and, each year, without permission, dispatches police cars and ambulances to the doors of thousands. from hotline to psych hospital, the focus is on risk management. it is on exerting control. by contrast, the core idea of the alliance‚Äôs program is that as long as you are talking about killing yourself, and feel you are being listened to and understood, you are much less prone to end your life. there‚Äôs little research that assesses these approaches or compares them. a 2020 study in the journal suicide and life-threatening behavior links a person‚Äôs perception of being coercively hospitalized with an increased risk of attempted suicide after hospitalization; there is little research that looks at the approach favored by the alliance.  
  
under mazel-carlton, the groups have grown to almost 30 from three, from boston to denver, despite the obstacles of the pandemic. at least as important, countless u.s. practitioners have learned new ways to listen to the desperate. and a brazilian mental-health organization, cenat, has brought mazel-carlton to that country, where she has spoken on suicide to clinicians, along with clergy, law enforcement and the diagnosed in s√£o paulo, vit√≥ria and salvador. mercycare, an australian community-services nonprofit, has flown her in to speak in sydney, melbourne and perth. over the past two years, in the united states, she has given dozens of talks on suicide and the hearing voices movement to audiences of several hundred at conferences, to social-work graduate students, to staff at psych hospitals on grand rounds. in early may, she was in indianapolis, teaching a roomful of clinicians not far from her childhood home.

1652827962,"chacku mathai, whose indian family immigrated to the united states when he was a child, works as a project director with a large new york state-funded program, ontrackny, which combines an emphasis on medication with the inclusion of client perspectives about their care. and he facilitates hearing voices groups. during one of our many conversations, mathai told me a parable about a traveler in a foreign land coming across a bird he has never seen before, a peacock. thinking that such a freakish creature will never survive, the traveler cuts off its feathers to correct nature‚Äôs error.  
  
mathai, who hears voices and has visions and was hospitalized after a suicide attempt as a teenager, is something like the peacock, except that he rejects medication that would shear away his difference. by immersing himself in yogic practices, he gives his mind a measure of rest. still, voices stalk him, suspicious of people and full of foreboding. sometimes, he told me, he thinks about whether, if the perfect antipsychotic existed, he would take it. ‚Äúmy experience is so rich,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúi wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything.‚Äù he spoke of having a keen empathy for the singularity and solitude of others, a sensitivity that can bring a feeling of being universally joined.  
  
beth, who asked that i use only her first name and who has led h.v.n. groups in western massachusetts, pointed out that though the hearing voices movement wrestles against conventional psychiatry, it isn‚Äôt anti-psychiatry. a former music teacher and cellist, beth used to take medications that left her with terrible tremors and a torturous physical restlessness called akathisia, deepening the agony of a teaching career lost to her struggles. but after an odyssey of working with inflexible psychiatrists, she found one willing to chart a path of mutual understanding and compromise. she continues to have unsettling visions, but a religious practice along with a calibrated mix of drugs helps somewhat to make her life more manageable while inflicting only mild tremors, and she is playing her cello for the first time in 20 years.

‚Äúit‚Äôs like an ecosystem of dreams,‚Äù dmitriy gutkovich said, describing his voices to me over zoom from foster city, calif. some threaten his family; others speak philosophically on entropy. he takes an almost negligible dose of an antipsychotic, an amount bordering on a placebo. more relevant, he explained, is that h.v.n. groups helped him to realize that coexistence with voices is possible. it is, he said, ‚Äúabout understanding them and their intentions, so that we can live in harmony; it‚Äôs about relationship management.‚Äù a decade ago, in his early 20s, he was ‚Äúnot in a period of perfect functioning,‚Äù he said wryly. ‚Äúthe professional assessment was doom and gloom.‚Äù he is now married and a new father. on the screen, he smiled beatifically about this. he is a marketing director at a magazine and oversees an eight-person team.

sometimes, at the end of a conversation with mazel-carlton, a mother will ask: ‚Äúwhen can we talk again? when?‚Äù there is nothing like the panic of a parent whose son or daughter knows another reality. in her office, late one afternoon in march, with the overhead light off and the light from the lone window getting dim, she counseled a mother for the second time by zoom. the woman‚Äôs grown son believed he was taking directions from god. in the recent past, he had been hospitalized, suicidal, homeless. ‚Äúhe thinks he‚Äôs kind of like a savior,‚Äù she told mazel-carlton. his ever-changing plans terrified her. ‚Äúi need to know how to talk to him. i don‚Äôt want to say the wrong thing. i‚Äôm trying to just be there, to be empathetic.‚Äù  
  
she knew mazel-carlton‚Äôs lessons well, and quietly, mazel-carlton echoed and encouraged her.  
  
‚Äúbut i don‚Äôt know how to get him to understand that i‚Äôm on his side. he‚Äôs very turned off to the mental-health system. he told me i put him in the hospital. i said it wasn‚Äôt me, it was the psychiatrist. i know he‚Äôs going to do what he‚Äôs going to do, i know i can‚Äôt prevent it, but he says he was comfortable being homeless, because no one could tell him anything ‚Äî and now what if he becomes homeless again? he could be killed, god forbid.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi‚Äôm not putting this on you,‚Äù mazel-carlton said, ‚Äúbut it sounds like he‚Äôs had some institutional trauma. so what i might avoid is bringing things up from a mental-health lens.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi think about the m-word,‚Äù she said, talking about medication. ‚Äúbut i don‚Äôt say it.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi think that‚Äôs wise.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi can‚Äôt help it.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi think it‚Äôs good that you don‚Äôt go there,‚Äù mazel-carlton said. ‚Äúpharmaceuticals are easily accessible ‚Äî he knows that. he knows he can make that choice anytime. when a mom brings up medication, it can sound like, i don‚Äôt like the way you are. like, the way you are makes me uncomfortable.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi‚Äôm freaking out.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúas adults, the moments when we feel that our parents trust us ‚Äî that‚Äôs the lottery-like feeling,‚Äù mazel-carlton said.

1652898361," another simple example of where tax loss harvesting is useful.

i have some apple stock i bought a couple of years ago and have unrealized gains.  i want to sell some.   so i sell $5k of stock, with $2k of that being profit.

meanwhile, i also bought $10k of the vti total us market etf last year and it is down 20%.   i sell it for $8k and immediately buy $8k of itot, another total us market etf, but one that follows an index by a different index provider, so they are not substantially identical stock per irs.  to i can immediate buy, without waiting 30 days and risking a price change.

the realized loss of $2k on the etf will offset the gain from the apple sale, and i don't owe any taxes.   since vti and itot track each other closely, i have not really changed my holding.

1652901533,"one thing i noticed, depending on the market sentiment, recent development, news and more importantly upcoming earnings and dividend payments along with what ever the trading community is looking at, the probabilities for certain patterns change.

check out the book 'chart logic' as an example. it is about a guy analyzing btc pattern probabilities. i applied the same methodology by printing out (or doing it in a paint program) charts of multiple days (at least last 30 to 60) and annotating certain patterns i am interested in. then i collect some base metrics for each pattern (e.g like range of consolidation, point in time, trend before consolidation, duration, breakout or breakdown, fake or not, duration of the trend afterwards etc.)

then i compile everything to something like: if there was an uptrend for at least x minutes/hours being 5 times the range of following consolidation then 80% of the breakouts (uptrend)  are not fake and go up for at least x times the consolidation range for 75% of the time and at least x for the 25% of the highest breakouts.

if you also do your risk/reward for each of the pattern found you easily get a table for each pattern you investigated and you can use these tables making easy decisions with a high degree of confidence. once you notice your success rates (win rate / gains) go down, redo the analysis.

do this for multiple stocks (especially for different sectors e.g. tech vs. finance) you will see some key differences in these tables (numbers) you get. every stock is more or less different in how pattern play out in detail especially if the companies play in different sectors and different markets.

as an recent obvious change look at the apple stock some weeks ago: an upward trend before lunch usually continues after lunch. in more recent weeks, lunchtime looks like a battle field with more or less chaotic consolidations and sometimes even violent negative breakdowns. and after lunch everything turns negative. it is quite apparent. me and a friend of mine just looked at apples some days ago, looked really brutal.",2,,IKnowMeNotYou,0

1652930998,"yes, you can, but of course it would be a heck of a lot of manual tagging. if you want to stick to ""standards"" (a very loose term), i suppose the tags to use would be performer and instrument. (both as multi-value and in the same order). see [tag mapping](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=tag_mapping) for suggested ""standard"" field names. or sure you could use custom tags if you like as well.

example tags -

artist: `the beatles`

performer: `john lennon; paul mccartney; george harrison; ringo starr`

instrument: `lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica; lead vocals, bass guitar; background vocals, electric guitar; drums, tambourine`

(note multiple values are separated by semi-colon)

in foobar [title formatting](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=foobar2000:title_formatting_reference#track_info_fields_and_functions), you can then combine the two fields for display purposes (for example in a [text display](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_textdisplay) / item details panel) -

`$meta(performer,0) '('$meta(instrument,0)')'`

= john lennon (lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica)

`$meta(performer,1) '('$meta(instrument,1)')'`

= paul mccartney (lead vocals, bass guitar)

(etc)

the advantage of a separate field for instrument is that you can leave it out and group the other two fields as individual values. in a library viewer like [facets](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_facets) or [library tree](https://github.com/wil-b/library-tree) (script), they have a feature to list ""[multiple patterns](https://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=foobar2000:components/facets_(foo_facets)#multiple_patterns)"" so the column can combine multiple fields together in one list.

example view pattern -

`%&lt;artist&gt;%|%&lt;performer&gt;%`

and so, when you click on 'john lennon', you would get his (solo) artist credits as well as performer credits, in this case 'the beatles'. similarly you can add additional custom fields to get the complete works of a single artist. i also tag featured artists for example all into one column -

`%&lt;artist&gt;%|%&lt;performer&gt;%|%&lt;featured&gt;%`

now if you also wanted the instrument field to have its own column of individual multi- values (so you could click on just 'harmonica'), that would be a bit more difficult. it would probably take some advanced title formatting or a different way of tagging than the above. (unless you just tag one instrument per performer per track)

anyway, just some ideas there and one way of going about it...

[it was an obvious play. only reason i didn't is because i've sworn off playing retail earnings for a while. i've been burned on 'obvious' plays enough.  it's not just wmt dropping 10%, but target prides itself in keeping prices low and avoiding passing costs to consumers. elevates the margin pinch from supply chain issues and inflation compared to others.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usd7yo/tgt_puts_gains/i936p91/)

[i was wondering the same thing. the market has already priced in some part of the bad results from wmt and tgt if you look at costco (-11%) and bjs wholesale (-16&amp;) stock today.     personally i think these might be a bit oversold considering bjs and costco make most of their money on memberships, not margin, so they might be a bit more resilient to inflation.       also, if you look at walmart's earning report, sam's club did pretty well compared to the rest of the business.       will probably get some cost calls closer to earnings depending on if the stock recovers or not before then.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usd7yo/tgt_puts_gains/i936fqt/)

however, when acquired, apple didn't acquire next at 1:1 stock value. i don't know the details, but simply multiplying apple's current stock price by 5000 shares doesn't correctly calculate what it'd be worth today.

\[edit, i just had to look: apple's stock has split on a 4-for-1 basis in 2020, a 7-for-1 basis in 2014, a 2-for-1 basis in 2005 and 2000. therefore, 4 x 7 x 2 x 2 = 112. 5000 shares of apple stock 25 years ago would be worth over 71 million dollars today.\]",29,,daroon,0

1653013790,"for the sake of a thought experiment, i propose that forbes stop profiling ‚Äúthe richest people,‚Äù and start following, ‚Äúwho made the most salary.‚Äù

why? because if your wealth is that you own stock in a company, that‚Äôs owning part of a company, not owning the wealth of the company. apple makes billions a year, but if you own apple stock you don‚Äôt make a dollar: only if you sell the ownership do you (potentially) make money. 

the issue then becomes that equity ownership is fluid and subject to instant transitory value. tesla‚Äôs new car is going to be a huge hit! elon makes $75,000,000 more dollars because people want to buy the stock, and the value of his stock goes up. whoops, the car falls apart, now he‚Äôs worth $50,000,000 less. 

but if he sold to collect the actual $100,000,000,000‚Ä¶ eventually people would think his stock is worthless, and it would be. elon cannot be worth that much, because if he tried to actually convert it to paper money, he would take a massive loss (probably 50-75% of his entire wealth would evaporate). 

to the contrary, lionel messi is paid $130,000,000 a year. people pay him. in cash. at the end he has $130,000,000 in cash to play around with. not some trick of perspective; not reliant on how well a company is doing: cash. and i think that‚Äôs more the measure of what should be focused on. tim cook makes more, but it‚Äôs $3,000,000 cash and $200,000,000 in stock options. and it‚Äôs the same thing with these ‚Äúrichest‚Äù people: all stock options. 

i contend elon couldn‚Äôt do shit, because he‚Äôs just a guy with credit enough that the credit companies constantly hand him money, no questions asked. he couldn‚Äôt do shit.",0,,scijior,0

if you haven't already noticed, interest rates are climbing, fast. house prices are falling fast. consumer goods prices are rising fast. food prices are rising fast. gas is astronomical. nasdaq is down 20+% since the beginning of the year. msft stock is down 40% in 6 months. s&amp;p is down 15% since the beginning of the year. some banks have already fallen 10%.

1653089321,"apple was worth 0 dollars when it started. now it‚Äôs worth trillions. jobs was the single most important person in making that happen. billions of people around the world became wealthier by owning apple stock (it‚Äôs the largest part of the s&amp;p 500). younger people aren‚Äôt often invested, but almost every older person is either directly or indirectly (e.g. in a 401k or pension fund). 

that‚Äôs the part you‚Äôre missing. those ‚Äúpoor farmers‚Äù literally and directly own the means of production. jobs was the person they trusted with their capital. jobs didn‚Äôt hoard wealth. he immediately reinvested every penny he had. those poor farmers regularly gave him more and more of their money because when they gave jobs a dollar, he later returned back $100.

capitalism where everyone understands how to invest works best for everyone. but if some people don‚Äôt know how to play the game, they miss out on all the benefits. if you don‚Äôt convert $1 of cash to $1 of stock, you will get most of the negatives of capitalism with few of the benefits.

socialism theoretically benefits everyone, but typically it benefits a select group of elites. the difference is that in capitalism, the elites are people like job who create value/grow the overall pie. others have to voluntarily give him their money and can take it back at anytime. in socialism, the elites are the people who use the threat of violence to take a larger slice of the pie.",1,,McKoijion,0

1653090797,"calculating your risk with options is pretty easy, as long as we are talking buying straight puts with enough time until expiration and intrinsic value left, and you are trading intraday. 

let's take aapl for example. last traded at around $137. 

the june 17th expiration $135 strike call is trading at $7.45, which means you need $745 to buy this contract since options trade in lots of 100. 

next you look at the delta of that option, which happens to be 0.59 right now. 

your delta tell you how much the value of your option changes for every dollar change in the underlying. so for every 1$ that aapl moves up or down, you will make or lose roughly $0.59. 

but remember that since options trade in groups of 100, you are really making $59 for every dollar that aapl shares go up, and $59 for every dollar that aapl shares go down. 

another way to think about this is the effective notational value of the contract in terms of shares. you multiply the price of aapl stock by 100, and then multiply that by the delta of your option. 

$137 times 100 = $13,700

$13,700 times 0.59 = $8083

so your risk profile of buying the aapl jun 17th 135c is roughly the same as owning $8,000 worth of aapl shares. 

notice how this is in the money and a few weeks out, on a very liquid options chain. you introduce more risks the more you do things like buy short dated otm options, hold them until close to expiration, and trade tickers with an illiquid options chain.",5,,ZanderDogz,0

1. start trimming positions and taking profits near the top starting last november (you don't need to sell it all or more than half if you bought it near or below the april 2020 52-low of $42.57) - this is the long account
2. enter short positions on pump peaks like may 4th - either short-term bear call spreads, or if you have tons of money - short the stock, sell a put for the end of the week and sell a protective call for insurance (if you want the insurance) - this is the short (margin) account
3. re-purchase shares by ladder down strategy.  set limit buy chunks at 10-20% below current price and ladder down from there. - this is the long account

if berkshire is truly smart, they will be doing this as you read it (except on weekends).  however, you won't see reports on it because short positions do not have to be reported frequently so unless a short position is held over quarter-end, you won't see it on any quarterly filing... and you won't see it on any filing unless the filer chooses to publish such information (hint: they don't and there's no incentive for them to do so).",1,,not_the_real_ellis,0

[\&gt; i'm constantly watching youtube videos, reading posts on here, talking to other traders, etc. i just feel like i'm becoming a worse trader somehow. it's getting to the point where i feel the need to write this post because i honestly don't know what else to do. &lt;  i advised a friend to stay on the side lines and cut loses quickly. he does not listen. best thing i did for him was making fun about the youtube people he follows and watch. they talk like they know stuff but researching them, most of them have no merits by not talking about their trades their actual wins and their failures. frauds, most of them.  also i get most of my knowledge (i swing traded for quite some time but seriously investing my free time into daytrading for about 4+ months) mainly from books. i am still overwhelmed.  i read min 10 books and just brought 10+ more based on the recommendations i found on this topic. i have absorbed so much ideas and helped a coworker as he used complex indicators but didn't know about the single bar basics.   once i am done and compiled all these ideas in my own way, i will be littered with conflicting ideas that might work on their own but combining those will ruin everything. i just have to keep it simple and do what has proven to work for me i guess. also i want to play back certain exceptional market situations and analyse and compile some play books to play these situations if history repeats itself. history does not repeat but it surely rhymes.      \&gt; i'll have a good couple of days in a row with my strategies, then i'll have a span of days or even weeks where i can not for the life of me have a winning trade. my problem in the past was that i didn't cut losers quick enough and i have huge losses that set me back a lot. i've tried to combat this with setting physical (instead of mental) stop losses. mental stop losses allow me to be emotional. however, my stop losses always seem to hit... no matter how close, no matter how far. &lt;     my preferred strategies make money some times but this is a very difficult time (at least for me) to trade most of the stocks i am interested in. the volatility is really bad. by comparing current aapl movements vs. 8 weeks ago for a starter gives a very good comparison. smart traders either learn how to play a difficult chaotic market or just take a longer vacation -&gt; of cause i am not smart! :-).   always remember a crisis is easy to trade and very short in duration. the uptrend is long and easy to trade. the consolidation (range) is hard to trade. you need to find stocks that behave in a predictable manor. check out a stock that has a good true range but regular movement like a metronome. you will not find it in tech stocks but those are out there.i used this during the time covid hit when doing swing trading. works good and is stress free (mostly).  \&gt; i try to hold winning trades, because i always seem to sell too soon before the actual run up. i sell for pennies, while the trade is actually on it's way to dollars in the money... but when i hold winning trades, it ultimately ends up working against me and i lose a decent amount of money. when i don't hold trades, i take smallll profits... and then it ends up running. &lt;  update your stop loss regularly to trail the price movement. also try to trim your position. just sell 50% of your position when you usually would sell everything update your stop loss and let it reasonable trail the actual price. also adjust your stop loss to at least break even when you trim your position. i find it helping me a lot.   remember: for each trade, first play to not lose (sl to break even) and then play to play good (do not thing about money, just try to play it flawlessly according to your initial(!) plan). it is easier said than done but i keep trying :-).  i am currently try to trade this chaotic situation doing 1min bars and 5min bars (usually i do 5min and 15min bars) with paper trading. i would not dare to put money where my mouth is with my current skill level in this situation. it is training season for me, i barely use serious money. i would have sidelined me and try to find fallen angels and pick up the crumbs (low profit targets). i wait for the rally that is about to happen tomorrow or within the next years](/r/daytrading/comments/uu7qjf/down_15_ytd_on_a_decent_sized_account_i_dont_know/i9fiq80/)

[calculating your risk with options is pretty easy, as long as we are talking buying straight puts with enough time until expiration and intrinsic value left, and you are trading intraday.   let's take aapl for example. last traded at around $137.   the june 17th expiration $135 strike call is trading at $7.45, which means you need $745 to buy this contract since options trade in lots of 100.   next you look at the delta of that option, which happens to be 0.59 right now.   your delta tell you how much the value of your option changes for every dollar change in the underlying. so for every 1$ that aapl moves up or down, you will make or lose roughly $0.59.   but remember that since options trade in groups of 100, you are really making $59 for every dollar that aapl shares go up, and $59 for every dollar that aapl shares go down.   another way to think about this is the effective notational value of the contract in terms of shares. you multiply the price of aapl stock by 100, and then multiply that by the delta of your option.   $137 times 100 = $13,700  $13,700 times 0.59 = $8083  so your risk profile of buying the aapl jun 17th 135c is roughly the same as owning $8,000 worth of aapl shares.   notice how this is in the money and a few weeks out, on a very liquid options chain. you introduce more risks the more you do things like buy short dated otm options, hold them until close to expiration, and trade tickers with an illiquid options chain.](/r/daytrading/comments/uu4ziv/options/i9e4vx1/)

rates have been held artificially low by the monetary policy in this country recently. will they drop in the future? possibly, but you know what they say about trying to time the market. even if they drop, i wouldn‚Äôt expect to see rates go back to the high 2%- low 3% range for 30 year fixed mortgages barring some type of financial catastrophe. rates can‚Äôt always be at an all time low in a functioning market. and hopefully we aren‚Äôt advising people to wait for the next financial crisis to buy home. there‚Äôs more to consider when buying a home than being frustrated that your friend or coworker bought a home and got a rate at 2.75% and now you are being offered 5.5%. i understand the sticker shock and pain for people who started shopping when rates were lower and haven‚Äôt been able to purchase as they see the real time impact on their purchasing power. but people will become accustomed to these rates as they level out and the sticker shock will fade.

purchasing a home is an investment not only financially but also in other ways that are hard to quantify. having a stable place to call home and raise a family is valuable. the pride in homeownership is valuable. there are opportunity costs involved as well. you are likely either paying your own mortgage or paying your landlords mortgage by paying rent. with rising rent costs the benefits of homeownership still likely outweigh the other option. and financially real estate has been one of the best wealth building vehicles in the history of this country. while the rising rates will likely cool and hopefully stabilize the market i don‚Äôt expect home prices to fall but rather the rate of home appreciation will slow. which means homes will still be more expensive in a year than they are now. there is still an imbalance between supply and demand. there is a not enough supply to fill the demand and simple economics dictates that will keep the prices up. also, the 2008 crash was caused by loose lending guidelines and home values fell after large amounts of foreclosures happened. there isn‚Äôt a looming foreclosure crisis that is going to cause property values to crash. 

i think people need to consider what is important to them and what is affordable to them. telling people to wait 1,2,3 years(who knows) for the market to drop or rates to drop doesn‚Äôt sound like sound financial advice.",3,,ganoe85,0

1653190522,"&gt;their hardware was pretty shitty until recently. their software is still shitty.

this is an opinion and doesn't affect their huge sales. obviously a bunch of people disagree or don't care. they're buying apple.

&gt;people who had stock before that had their investment balloon not from sales but from others buying stock too. if they dumped stock it would certainly be gains from other people's losses.

i mean yes, if everybody dumped the stock it would go down in price. but it would reach a price where it wouldn't make sense to not buy apple where it would stabilise. even if investors lost faith apple as a company could buy back their own stock because they have a huge amount of cash. this doesn't exist with ethereum, it could go to 0 with nobody buying it assuming they don't think the price will go up later. if you bought apple stock you would always own a part of a company with great sales, a bunch of ips, unsold products to sell or use, brand value and real estate. even if sales and brand value would plummet there are still inherent values in the rest. 

&gt;like any good stock with good a good product, the longer you hold the more worth your investment will be.

everything up to here was marketing. i can't say you're wrong because you're trying to sell me a story, not argue with facts. but i think you have bought the ethereum goggles and refuse to see the warning signs. it doesn't scale well, the gas price spikes are not good for future potential and the potential failure and risk of pos makes it extremely risky. try to be nuanced.

and ether is not stock in that company and should not be treated as such. even if people use their blockchain you're not sure your investment will grow. that price is and will always be speculation. that's the difference. you don't own the right to get a share in profits, they don't have a fiduciary duty toward holders and your unregulared security doesn't have any legal protections.

&gt;people have been scammed with stocks before. you don't blindly invest in any startup and expect returns. it's gotta be good and have a future. 

i agree, i don't get why you used apple as an example. another guy used disney. i suspect it's because you guys doesn't understand what makes a stock different from a cryptocurrency which is why your arguments suck including your examples. but even overvalued (which you totally can argue apple is too, but i already said why it has inherent values) growth stocks with debt have ips, products and are marketing the potential to get huge and later pay the investors back with future profits. people speculate for sure but it has some basis in reality, crypto has a basis in more adoption and therefore selling to someone else for a higher price.

""...crypto blockchains are useless and a big gamble."" i'll agree with that part at least. i think ethereum is a pre-mined, bloated, unscalable piece of crap built on hype and not much, if any, real utility. it's a negative sum game just like the rest and all your buzzwords marketing did a bad job to convince.",4,,Jankylad,0

1653232175,"[\&gt; i'm constantly watching youtube videos, reading posts on here, talking to other traders, etc. i just feel like i'm becoming a worse trader somehow. it's getting to the point where i feel the need to write this post because i honestly don't know what else to do. &lt;  i advised a friend to stay on the side lines and cut loses quickly. he does not listen. best thing i did for him was making fun about the youtube people he follows and watch. they talk like they know stuff but researching them, most of them have no merits by not talking about their trades their actual wins and their failures. frauds, most of them.  also i get most of my knowledge (i swing traded for quite some time but seriously investing my free time into daytrading for about 4+ months) mainly from books. i am still overwhelmed.  i read min 10 books and just brought 10+ more based on the recommendations i found on this topic. i have absorbed so much ideas and helped a coworker as he used complex indicators but didn't know about the single bar basics.   once i am done and compiled all these ideas in my own way, i will be littered with conflicting ideas that might work on their own but combining those will ruin everything. i just have to keep it simple and do what has proven to work for me i guess. also i want to play back certain exceptional market situations and analyse and compile some play books to play these situations if history repeats itself. history does not repeat but it surely rhymes.      \&gt; i'll have a good couple of days in a row with my strategies, then i'll have a span of days or even weeks where i can not for the life of me have a winning trade. my problem in the past was that i didn't cut losers quick enough and i have huge losses that set me back a lot. i've tried to combat this with setting physical (instead of mental) stop losses. mental stop losses allow me to be emotional. however, my stop losses always seem to hit... no matter how close, no matter how far. &lt;     my preferred strategies make money some times but this is a very difficult time (at least for me) to trade most of the stocks i am interested in. the volatility is really bad. by comparing current aapl movements vs. 8 weeks ago for a starter gives a very good comparison. smart traders either learn how to play a difficult chaotic market or just take a longer vacation -&gt; of cause i am not smart! :-).   always remember a crisis is easy to trade and very short in duration. the uptrend is long and easy to trade. the consolidation (range) is hard to trade. you need to find stocks that behave in a predictable manor. check out a stock that has a good true range but regular movement like a metronome. you will not find it in tech stocks but those are out there.i used this during the time covid hit when doing swing trading. works good and is stress free (mostly).  \&gt; i try to hold winning trades, because i always seem to sell too soon before the actual run up. i sell for pennies, while the trade is actually on it's way to dollars in the money... but when i hold winning trades, it ultimately ends up working against me and i lose a decent amount of money. when i don't hold trades, i take smallll profits... and then it ends up running. &lt;  update your stop loss regularly to trail the price movement. also try to trim your position. just sell 50% of your position when you usually would sell everything update your stop loss and let it reasonable trail the actual price. also adjust your stop loss to at least break even when you trim your position. i find it helping me a lot.   remember: for each trade, first play to not lose (sl to break even) and then play to play good (do not thing about money, just try to play it flawlessly according to your initial(!) plan). it is easier said than done but i keep trying :-).  i am currently try to trade this chaotic situation doing 1min bars and 5min bars (usually i do 5min and 15min bars) with paper trading. i would not dare to put money where my mouth is with my current skill level in this situation. it is training season for me, i barely use serious money. i would have sidelined me and try to find fallen angels and pick up the crumbs (low profit targets). i wait for the rally that is about to happen tomorrow or within the next years](/r/daytrading/comments/uu7qjf/down_15_ytd_on_a_decent_sized_account_i_dont_know/i9fiq80/)

[calculating your risk with options is pretty easy, as long as we are talking buying straight puts with enough time until expiration and intrinsic value left, and you are trading intraday.   let's take aapl for example. last traded at around $137.   the june 17th expiration $135 strike call is trading at $7.45, which means you need $745 to buy this contract since options trade in lots of 100.   next you look at the delta of that option, which happens to be 0.59 right now.   your delta tell you how much the value of your option changes for every dollar change in the underlying. so for every 1$ that aapl moves up or down, you will make or lose roughly $0.59.   but remember that since options trade in groups of 100, you are really making $59 for every dollar that aapl shares go up, and $59 for every dollar that aapl shares go down.   another way to think about this is the effective notational value of the contract in terms of shares. you multiply the price of aapl stock by 100, and then multiply that by the delta of your option.   $137 times 100 = $13,700  $13,700 times 0.59 = $8083  so your risk profile of buying the aapl jun 17th 135c is roughly the same as owning $8,000 worth of aapl shares.   notice how this is in the money and a few weeks out, on a very liquid options chain. you introduce more risks the more you do things like buy short dated otm options, hold them until close to expiration, and trade tickers with an illiquid options chain.](/r/daytrading/comments/uu4ziv/options/i9e4vx1/)

[i've done short moves with spy, but i do this with aapl and amd everyday. not every-trade, but after 10:30, i basically scalp. i just checked and today my average scalp was .21 cents. today was a shorter day. some days it's more like .30 cents. i trade shares, not options. my average trade today was 2000 shares at a time. made $5,880 today before noon.   i've taken two losses this week. one was for $631 and another was $787. however for the week, i'm up $17k.   just like anything, you have to train for it, and be precise with your moves. i'm not just blindly buying in, i have a specific strategy ive adapted/developed and constantly trying to improve.   if you're buying in blindly, you'll get smoked. but if you pay attention to only a handful of big cap stocks with a lot of volume, scalping is easy. you can't have fear and freak out. most of the times, im buying into a stock while its dropping, if it bases, then ive missed the move.   the funny thing is... i get scared to hold overnight, and think it's freaking crazy that anyone would keep their money in a stock all day.](/r/daytrading/comments/ut5nxs/scalping_pennies_on_the_sp/i99xfiu/)

so i am actually not in a bad situation currently even with the current bear market (even though i am down to the beginning of 2021 pretty much). but for the last year or so, i started to learn a bit more about investing and realized that i was actually extremely lucky with my investments and 50-60% average gains for a few consecutive years is actually not normal. i also learned about my biases, like just knowing about tech sector. so i started to invest in etfs instead. but there are so many options that it is hard to choose a couple and keep investing in them for the rest of my life.

but i guess, like you said, a broad index fund like ishares core msci world suits me the best, the more i investigate the more i think it is one of the most balanced etfs, so i can't go wrong with it.

1653309845,"[this is a really good post. thanks for sharing.  i guess what i'll add to the discussion is that over the years i've become less of a believer in using dcf models as a primary means to value companies. what you tend to find is that dcf models make trash look really attractive and quality companies look uninvestable. it's why you see all the value investors on youtube, etc saying don't buy companies like aapl and msft while recommending people invest in companies like intc, fb or baba.  these days i like to use dcf models just to sanity check an investment. so for example you have a price target of around $275 on shop which i think is a little low, but either way it's not a million miles away from the current valuation.  at the same time shop is one of the most innovative companies in the ecommerce space and they're building themselves a significant moat with an ecosystem of products and services. i think a good argument can be made that shop deserve some kind of a premium. at the same time i think the mistake some value investors make is not significantly discounting stocks like intc for the risk that they will continue to disappoint.  on top of that valuations largely depend on sentiment and broader macro environment. in 2020/2021 shop benefited massively from the positive investor sentiment towards ecommerce and the easy money macro environment we were in. then in 2022 that completely flipped. in my opinion the valuation rerating of stocks like shop has less to do with the market seeing sense in regards to shop specifically and more to do with broader market sentiment and macro shifts. whether a company like shop is going to do well over the next few years probably depends far more on the risk appetite in the broader market than it looking 10% over or undervalued on a dfc analysis. if the market starts to believe inflation has peaked and the long-term growth narrative of pandemic winners like shop is mostly intact we'll probably see shop move higher regardless of valuation as investors feel more comfortable putting money back into those kinds of companies. similarly if inflation remains persistently high and the fed gets even more hawkish then stocks like shop will continue to fall regardless of their valuations.](/r/stocks/comments/uv7ueo/shopify_company_analysis_and_valuation_80_down/i9kjzv3/)

[now it seems realistically priced. in fact all tech stocks except tsla now seem reasonably priced, especially the best one, aapl.    ecommerce in general has real challenges now though with shipping, supply chains and inflation eating into everything.  so why not just go with the tried and true winner, aapl?  they make a lot of money in all these sectors despite not being directly involved.  for instance do you know apple makes more money from games than anyone despite the fact they don't own a gaming division? plus now they make the fastest most powerful chips.  and btw despite all the regulatory ""bipartisan"" bodies trying to punish megatech i doubt it will ever happen. liz warren and that khan woman will not get their way.   so do not expect any costly forced breakups or business model changes to the megas. in fact the only one that really hit and matters is what apple did to fb and google. that was a mega on mega regulation and taught us who the real boss is, apple.](/r/stocks/comments/uv7ueo/shopify_company_analysis_and_valuation_80_down/i9ly5i2/)

[unless you need the cash to live on, this is the worst time to be sellng unless you think the company or crypto m ght go belly up, in which case take your losses and put the money into a great beaten down champ like aapl. sitting on cash and waiting is also an option though all that does is stop you from losing, you do not gain and may be missing the bjuying  op of the decade.  the best stock is aapl and is has dropped like everything else, now down around 25%.   i am holding a lot of aapl longterm and dont need the cash for years so decided just to bite the bullet as all these sell-offs finally end and eventually correct back upwards, so long as the company you own is as profitable as aapl.  i now i am considering buying m ore aapl. why  not?  what is the risk, 5 points?  aapl should pop back, 10 points when china ends its shutdowns (any day now) and the entire market will recover (and oil prices will plummet) when putin is finished bombarding ukraine and that whole mess starts freversing itself.  in the meantime the war, the gop ""blame it on biden"" and their friends the gas gougers, and fed will dampen the economy and make sure every company has a disappointing quarter or two or three. the fed will stop raising rates once they have created a recession, which i think they have already done, with putin's help.   so in the case of aapl i think we are probably at or very near the low point, buying here for the longterm is smart, and very few people will do it. inn fact more will sell at the bottom that will buy at the bottom.  btw the reason i am rich is that i started buying aapl at a time far worse than this, in november 2008. i think i paid $17 for aapl shares then, sold them six months later for $35 and then re-bought and kept re-buying everytime there was a severe sell-off.   my aapl shares are now up around 550%, they were up over %600 s month ago. just always remember, they aint up or down anything until the moment you sell.](/r/stocks/comments/uuxilp/what_are_you_doing_in_this_market_right_now/i9k1pfs/)

[many of them don't, or they aren't near their implied move. this is what you are looking to find and it really isn't that hard if you just look at the days anticipated earnings.  you are also thinking about it wrong. you don't want to have calls or puts before earnings. your goal is to have everyone else buy those calls or puts, because they are anticipating a large % move, so they are spending a lot more to buy the option, because of high iv. they don't get that large % move, or its not enough to really make their option move, so when the market opens they are now down 50-80 percent on their premium and most likely are just going to sell it.   here is where you come in to make your money. you see these option premiums, you can see the price they are at now versus the price they were at yesterday, the day before, etc, so you now know the range of these premiums. buying them at this point that they are down so much is basically getting them at a discount, and you want to wait for a little volume to come in, but typically its an excellent way to take advantage of earnings without risking it on a gamble.   heres an actual example, i can't find the historical options chart for aapl but the day of their earnings their 160-165 calls were going for 1.70 a piece. iv on them was high but not insane. apple had great earnings, stock was up 3-4% ah. next morning it was up 1-3 percent pre-market and opened at 161.83 after closing at 163.79, so a lot of call option holders were dumping those contracts. the low then went to 160.83 on the first 5-minute candle (calls are now seriously discounted despite great earnings and lots of buying pressure is now coming in) and then we saw the huge move to close that candle at 164.16 and the next 5-minute candle hits 164.84. there was another small dip after this and the chance to take those calls even higher but personally i have a problem of selling my entire position and not leaving some runners.](/r/stocks/comments/uva5qo/is_there_any_reason_not_to_short_or_buy_puts_for/i9lfcdb/)

1653319928,"&gt;if you are using shiller p/e why do you even care whether forward p/e falls or not, you do know shiller p/e uses the past 10 year average right? as if amazon and microsoft stock prices moves based on their averages from 10 years ago, not on their future performance.

i never suggested shiller pe should be used to value individual stocks.  it should only be used to see if the entire market is at relative highs or lows.  we shouldn't expect the relationship between the next ten years' of earnings and the last ten years' of earnings to differ singificantly from its value over recent history.

you're calling this approach high school level, but you aren't even reading my comment correctly.

and i should mentino that we are still almost double what forward pe was in 2008.  2008 likely dipped much lower than 2000 because there was significantly more real economy pain in '08 than in '00.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;of course nobody knows with certainty whether the forward p/e holds or not, that's why eps guidance is so crucial. but, i ask how do you know that forward p/e won't be lower because most companies managed to to pass on inflation to their customers (demand is still extremely strong, and companies are mostly reporting supply chain issues)? how do you know whether china's shanghai lockdown won't be quick and successful (they plan to be back to normal starting june 1st)? how do you know whether europe avoids a recession because they have agreed to pay for russian commodities (germany and italy have decided they can pay for russian gas using rubles)? what i do know is historically barring a deep recession, 14 to 15 forward is probably cheap enough for 3% interest rates, especially when 5-year expectations are still in the low 2s.

inflation tends to raise top lines but lower bottom lines.  we have seen that in the retail earnings reports of late.  more importantly, though, the efforts to fight inflation put the brakes on demand across the board.  this likely puts downward pressure on the top line while really pinching the bottom line.

i'm not claiming we know any of the things you mentioned.  i'm only claiming that we should expect economic slowdown and lower earnings.  surely you agree that companies tend to earn less during recessions, no?

forward pe is a poor measure of market valuations relative to historical norms because the earnings that determine a company's value are *all* future earnings, not just near-term earnings.  so forward earnings could look cheap if near-term earnings are expected to be really high.  but a spike in near-term earnings shouldn't result in a proportional spike in valuation as it is likely that companies in aggregate will return to their historical trend line on earnings.",3,,gravcycrunnow,0

if you're watching the ticker on the apple stock app (which it looks like op is) then you'll notice each stock has a list of articles at the bottom related to that stock. if you keep seeing articles about gamestop, it's because you're looking at the gme ticker, or it's on your watchlist.

each stock i follow on apple stocks has a list of articles related to it underneath its graph. i'm guessing financial media push articles for every stock no matter how minuit, in order to increase their clicks and views. it's all about numbers for them remember they make money selling ad space.",15,,I_Fuck_Older_Women,0

i own 100 shares of tesla stock. my friend b owns 100 shares of microsoft stock. my friend c owns 100 shares of gme (he doesn't have all his marbles unfortunately). we decide to keep our own ledger of trades outside of the official exchanges. in this i trade 50 tesla for 50 microsoft. then a week later i trade 25 microsoft for 30 of my tesla back due to price changes. we trade back and forth literally for the next 3 years. after 3 years of trading stocks, selling for usd, etc. we then report back to the stock market a single trade from each person to each other in our ""dark pool"" which is the difference in shares from where we started to where we ended up at the end of our thousands of trades. so if i ended up with 80 tesla shares i report trading 20 shares to person b. how does your defi protocol handle that?",2,,googleduck,0

[aapl is one of the least affected by rates since they have a aaa rating and can borrow for near nothing. they make billions every year already borrowing cheapo and buying higher rate corporate bonds.  they are like a bank in many ways, a very big bank.  plus their cashflow even in a slowdown, is off the charts.  a billion paying subscribers to ios and none of them are moving over to android or windows.  they also have pricing power and expect the iphones to be $100 more next year.  not only that but if they want to stop buying back stock and takeover a few undervalued gem companies now they can do it. apple's business also requires very little oil-gas or food and tim cook is first in line for the microchips and components apple needs.  once the china shutdown ends this could be a very exciting positive year for apple. and if their ar headsets are ready, that is a whole new product category and the new apple chips have the power to drive those babies.  as for china, they cooperate with apple and do not bully them unlike other companies. during this china shutdown, only a few plants were kept running in quarantine mode with the help of the government, and so apple will only lose a few weeks or production, not six weeks, then they can make up for it later. plus they are up and running in india and gradually reducing reliance on china.   chinese stocks i would stay away from since they are under chinese government control, and would suffer from any anti chinese tariffs or sanctions. apple products were exempt from chinese tariffs, remember. so even if china armed putin and got sanctioned apple would likely remain exempt. that is because china and the us both need apple equally.](/r/stocks/comments/uv23ss/can_we_stop_posting_about_index_funds_and_move/i9lmkpu/)

[unless you need the cash to live on, this is the worst time to be sellng unless you think the company or crypto m ght go belly up, in which case take your losses and put the money into a great beaten down champ like aapl. sitting on cash and waiting is also an option though all that does is stop you from losing, you do not gain and may be missing the bjuying  op of the decade.  the best stock is aapl and is has dropped like everything else, now down around 25%.   i am holding a lot of aapl longterm and dont need the cash for years so decided just to bite the bullet as all these sell-offs finally end and eventually correct back upwards, so long as the company you own is as profitable as aapl.  i now i am considering buying m ore aapl. why  not?  what is the risk, 5 points?  aapl should pop back, 10 points when china ends its shutdowns (any day now) and the entire market will recover (and oil prices will plummet) when putin is finished bombarding ukraine and that whole mess starts freversing itself.  in the meantime the war, the gop ""blame it on biden"" and their friends the gas gougers, and fed will dampen the economy and make sure every company has a disappointing quarter or two or three. the fed will stop raising rates once they have created a recession, which i think they have already done, with putin's help.   so in the case of aapl i think we are probably at or very near the low point, buying here for the longterm is smart, and very few people will do it. inn fact more will sell at the bottom that will buy at the bottom.  btw the reason i am rich is that i started buying aapl at a time far worse than this, in november 2008. i think i paid $17 for aapl shares then, sold them six months later for $35 and then re-bought and kept re-buying everytime there was a severe sell-off.   my aapl shares are now up around 550%, they were up over %600 s month ago. just always remember, they aint up or down anything until the moment you sell.](/r/stocks/comments/uuxilp/what_are_you_doing_in_this_market_right_now/i9k1pfs/)

1653406597,"came here to say this, especially about the diversifying. even if you can just put $10 or something a week into your investing, directing some right away into a basic index fund each time will go a long way before you are even an adult. i knew quite a bit about investing at your age, but it was much harder to start out with small increments in the early 90s...commissions and fees were so much more, and the barrier to entry was just so much higher. like having to put in a few thousand just to open a bare bones brokerage acct with someone like schwab. so i didn't get started when it would have done the most good.

anyway, good luck, keep educating yourself, diversify, and don't freak out about the little dips and peaks (good or bad). keep the big picture in mind, and remember that dips in the market is like your favorite store having a big sale...you get to buy more! as long as you are in more than one asset or class (as in, not just apple stock or whatever...almost all things come to an end), you'll come out ahead. dollar cost averaging is everything over time.

also use this time to learn about/play with budgeting and what is sometimes called ""paying yourself first."" whether at your age and the next few years, you have odd jobs, a steady job, or just random windfalls like holiday $$ gifts...pick a percentage and always put that amount or more right into savings/investment, so you get used to that and don't miss it. :) it makes the mindset so much easier by the time you have to seriously consider things like taxes.",1,,stefanica,0

1653425217,"**you guys are changing or totally missing the main point.** running around talking about market cap when the whole point is you will not receive a split, period. you will receive a dividend in the form of an addtional stock. why this difference matters is apes thinking that they will buy the stock for $20 ;ain't gonna happen.  the stock price by the ex-dividend date may end up higher than is now, because of the runup prior to the call.  which means some apes may be priced out of buying additional shares to attach the additional stock dividend to.  the stock dividend will be distributed to existing shares as of the ex-dividend date.  buy as many as you can at these low prices and before the ex-dividend date!  the market cap will be what it will be.

i suspect the push to define the stock dividend as typical split is to suppress fomo buying prior to the call/ex-dividend date and at these low prices.

edit: looking at the nvidia stock split dividend case, they actually did both. 4 for 1 split + 3 additional share dividend. however again the share dividend was only given to held shares as of the record date which is before the ex-dividend date.

&gt;although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.

&gt;the development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.

and my returns will *converge* to almost the same number no matter what time period i buy if its a long enough period. &lt;--- this is the most important fact to know about returns

15% of my cash sits in my bank waiting for even better opportunities - for example if meta drops by 10%, i'm gonna use 5% of my 15% again to buy more meta stock, another 10% drop means another 5% cash used and so on...

1653551384,"technically gold also has value only because people give it value. if you think being backed in gold is enough to make currency 100% stable then i don't know what to say. the reason gold has value is because for a very long time people gave it value and there are few properties that make it desirable. backing currencies by gold for a very long time made it desirable too. now as long as let's say you want to buy something from china then you will need to buy yuen first increasing demand for yuen. technically every thing (gold, money, crypto, stocks) has value based on how much people want it. 

now the main issue is collapse. the situation where prices suddenly drop and everyone start selling to reduce to amount of money they lose. in these kind of situation 2 things matter most. 
1. trust in currency/government/company. lets say you have apple stock and suddenly they dropped 10%. do you trust the company enough to hold the stock assuming that they will recover from the dip in some time. if you do you will probably won't sell and might even use the dip to buy more taking away some impact of the dip
2. the resistance to the dip company/country is able to put up. let's say apple's stock dips 50%. company will come up with some statement, plan few actions that will boost it's prices back up to desired levels. if currency starts dropping then they might use reserves to reduce the impact.

crypto doesn't have long term in built trust. it doesn't have any physical infrastructure backing it. it doesn't have a group with resources to ensure that its value remain stable. the difference between crypto and regular currency/stocks is the same as difference between most safe car today ve least safe car from 50 years ago. both can be crumbled like paper and kill everyone in it but one has a lot more safety measures placed in it and has as lot more complicated system in place while other does not.",0,,musci1223,0

1653562723,"ive been holding since 2016 and i'm very happy with these results. the results itself are insane considering that for most of the quarter the current macro challenges already existed. 

the crypo-worries are a nothingburger, fundamentally it was much worse in 2018. from that experience they learned to deal with it as far as you can even deal with it. it's not fundamental to their business. for the next quarter you'd expect a dent anyway because it's ampere's 8th quarter. lovelace brings a hefty node jump, it won't be as hard to sell as the 2000 series was. they'll continue to sell many gpus and even if they don't, they've been progressing geforce now nicely. 

meanwhile the datacenter story is fully intact if not better. this is really where many don't get it. datacenter is what makes or brakes nvda stock. jensen wants to deliver the full stack. nvda's whole rise is due to dc. 6 years ago gaming revenue was $687m in a quarter. dc was $143m. now dc revenue is $3.75b, higher than gaming, with insane margins intact. the only reason you can even still talk about gaming is because of very respectable better than expected performance by gaming aswell, but it's not what makes nvda a potential $1t stock. they did't buy a mellaox for gaming. they didn't want to buy an arm for gaming. they aren't working on a cpu for gaming. the margins and the growth are in datacenter. 

on top of datacenter they keep working on very interesting things like omniverse and self driving. that potential remains a cherry on top though.

i'm sleeping well holding nvda stock even after the recent collapse. this is where you load up. in 2018 the collapse was just as fierce and the reasons were pretty similar. just because the stock price tanks doesn't mean they stop working. they recovered in 2018 to highs noone believed possible and they may aswell do the same now.",5,,trnvtl,0

1653563265,"hvis du har ret i et foster ikke er et menneske, s√• er jeg 100% enig med dig. abort skal v√¶re lovligt under alle tilf√¶lde. en abort vil v√¶re moralsk det samme som at klippe negle, hvis et foster ikke er et menneske. hvis du kan vise mig at et foster ikke er et menneske, vil jeg droppe alle mine holdninger om abort med det samme

men jeg syntes vi har gode videnskabelige grunde til at tro at et foster er et menneske. her er et citat fra en bog om embryologi, som man bruger p√• uddannelser som l√¶ge og sygeplejerske.

&gt;*""zygote. this cell results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm during fertilization. a zygote is the beginning of a new human being (i.e., an embryo).""*

\[moore, keith l. and persaud, t.v.n. the developing human: clinically oriented embryology. 7th edition. philadelphia: saunders 2003, p. 2.\]

&gt;overall, 95% of all biologists affirmed the biological view that a human's life begins at fertilization

citat fra et papir hvor man har spurgt over 5000 biologer om hvorn√•r et menneskeliv begynder(85% underst√∏tter fri abort, og de fleste af dem er ikke religi√∏se) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3211703](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703)

jeg vil mene at afvise fosterets status som menneske er problematisk. for det f√∏rste skal man kunne vise at et foster ikke er et menneske(hvilke grunde har du f. eks til at tro at et foster ikke er et menneske?), for det andet skal man bortforklare videnskaben. hvordan forklarer man at de relevante eksperter siger at et menneskeliv begynder ved undfangelsen? hvis 95% af 5000 biologer siger at noget er rigtigt, hvilke grunde har man til at tro at de tager fejl? ikke nok med det, men et foster er dens egen unikke organisme. begge dets for√¶ldre er mennesker, det har menneske dna; hvis det ikke er et menneske, hvad i alverden er det s√•?

&gt;det var en god dialog.

n√•r 40+ personer har forn√¶rmet mig er det meget bem√¶rkelsesv√¶rdigt at der er en der svarer respektfuldt og er s√∏gende(interesseret i en √¶rlig dialog).",1,,Embarrassed_Pie4277,0

what do the scientists who are most familiar with genetics and embryology say?  
the developing human: clinically oriented embryology, 6th ed. keith l. moore, ph.d. &amp; t.v.n. persaud, md., (philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1998), 2-18:  
""\[the zygote\] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. a zygote is the beginning of a new human being. human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. this highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.""  
from human embryology &amp; teratology, ronan r. o'rahilly, fabiola muller, (new york: wiley-liss, 1996), 5-55:  
""fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... the zygote ... is a unicellular embryo..""  
essentials of human embryology, william j. larsen, (new york: churchill livingstone, 1998), 1-17:

1653584332,"you're right the coins price is dictated by buy vs sell and not necessarily when a staking period ends.  based on the current graph a would expect that previous stakers are not restaking.  the price should stay flat rather than drop the way it has.  

&amp;#x200b;

you're right bitcoin is not being used in the way it was designed, but that doesn't mean the utility is lost.  you can still use bitcoin as exchange for goods.  realistically all crypto is a scam.  in the sense that there are no tangible metrics to back up its valuation.  for example, apple stock is worth $140/ share because they sell a real product and have real revenue.  crypto has none of this, it's all about what people are willing to pay for it.  i am a firm believer that crypto did exactly what it was supposed to do and that is be a proof of concept for blockchain the tech.  no one believes me, but i'm here for the tech and not the currencies.  to me, the tech has real world uses.  crypto does to a degree, but like you said has a barrier to mass adoption.  banks recognizing it as an ""asset"" is huge.  but i think there are more hurdles to overcome before crypto is regulated.       

&amp;#x200b;

my issue with the comparison to cd's is that they are not cd's.  a cd is a very specific type of investment that allows gives you more money than you started with.  [https://hex.com/howitworks/](https://hex.com/howitworks/)  the first thing it says on the site is that hex is a certificate of deposit.. so to your point, they are directly comparing it.  do not call it a cd call it a store of value.  a cd implies you will see a return on your dollar.  a hex stake is a return on your coin.  these are two completely different values in my opinion.  

&amp;#x200b;

excuse my phrasing - not all blockchain tech is immutable, though it should be.  there are pitfalls with this as well, but for the sake of security, immutability should be priority.  i'm not how this fact about hex makes it superior to other cryptos.  80% of the coins in circulation are in 1 oa wallet whose holder is unknown.  that wouldn't make me feel good about my investment.  

&amp;#x200b;

the way i see it once a scammer always a scammer.  it's not about the repercussions, its about his intentions.  he felt he could spam and sell a product that has been found to not work.  as for crypto, he found an unregulated industry that had billions poured into it.  hes not an idiot.  

&amp;#x200b;

well, how many devs are on the team?  have they ever worked on creating a blockchain network?  what is their experience in this space?  how many successful projects have they launched?  do they have any dings on their record for fraud or scams?  i can keept asking questions, but i think oyu get the point.   
i like to know what and who i'm investing in.  it's not just the product its the people building the product.  the projects i have interest in are ethereum (go figure), oceanprotocol, medicalchain coin (they have gone dormant, however), mana, and nucypher.  all of these dev teams can be researched and verified.  hex cannot. 

&amp;#x200b;

you're lucky for when you got involved with hex and i hope you are able to make a profit on your stakes.  but that can't be said for most.  and i'm not sure how rh will convince people to continue investing in hex.  you need more people to buy and hold to outpace the yearly inflation.

&amp;#x200b;

of course i know about the $27 million he raised for charity.. he talks about it at nauseum.  it's a great marketing tool.  as he says, hes the only person in crypto doing what hes doing.  he's the most transparent and honest crypto entrepreneur.   if i recall the spam he used to push was for an anti aging pill..  what does the sens foundation do again..?   

&amp;#x200b;

my issues with hex are in 3 parts; rh is a douche (talk more about your pp and the millions you have in watches, because that's what your followers want to hear), the hex community is toxic (rh can do no wrong and if you say different you're a troll), the tokenomics of hex are not as sound as your believe.  you need constant community growth to outpace inflation.  if you forget about your stake and miss the withdraw window you're penalized (that is fucking bullshit).  the cost to exit your position is costing people their entire stake reward and then some.  the oa wallet gets bonuses the user should be getting.  i understand the intention of the oa wallet (that is not lost on me), but the lack of clarity surrounding it is suspect.

1653585883,"**chipmaker broadcom to buy software group vmware for $69bn**

_takeover would help transform acquisitive semiconductor company into diversified tech business_

us chipmaker broadcom has agreed to acquire cloud software company vmware for $69bn, including debt, in a takeover that signals the market for large corporate mergers might be thawing after a stock market rout at the start of the year.

vmware shareholders will be able to choose to receive either $142.50 in cash or 0.2520 shares of broadcom stock for each of their shares in the software group, at a 33 per cent premium over the value of the company before talks emerged last week.

the takeover, which is being supported with $32bn in bank financing, would help transform broadcom, an acquisitive semiconductor group, into a diversified tech company ranging from chips to cloud computing services.

hock tan, the malaysian american billionaire who leads broadcom, has been on the hunt for a software deal for years after his attempt to acquire chipmaker qualcomm was blocked in 2018 by then us president donald trump over national security concerns.

‚Äúbuilding upon our proven track record of successful m&amp;a, this transaction combines our leading semiconductor and infrastructure software businesses with an iconic pioneer and innovator in enterprise software as we reimagine what we can deliver to customers,‚Äù tan said.

in striking a deal for vmware, tan, known as the chip industry‚Äôs arch consolidator, is opportunistically picking up one of the software industry‚Äôs most valuable and profitable companies.

vmware‚Äôs stock price had fallen about half from its 2019 peak ‚Äî and 20 per cent below where it traded at the beginning of the year ‚Äî before deal talks emerged. but vmware‚Äôs high profit margins and stable recurring revenues offer the ability for broadcom to finance a large takeover and then quickly pay down debt.

‚Äúthey are very disciplined,‚Äù said tony wang ‚Äî who covers broadcom for t rowe price, one of its largest outside shareholders ‚Äî adding that the deal did not ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù him given that tech stocks were more attractively valued after this year‚Äôs market sell-off. when technology valuations were high in recent years, broadcom resisted the urge to make large purchases, said wang.

vmware is the biggest test yet of tan‚Äôs strategy to grow broadcom through acquisitions. many see his approach as akin to a private equity firm, where the buyer will sell off non-core assets and cut costs to increase overall profits.

‚Äúhock tan is running broadcom kind of like a private equity shop,‚Äù said jordan chalfin, a senior analyst at creditsights. ‚Äúhe has a reputation for slashing costs. that is probably going to be part of the playbook too.‚Äù

if completed, the deal will further turn broadcom into a diversified technology company instead of one focused principally on semiconductors. inclusive of vmware, broadcom‚Äôs revenues would be split evenly between software and semiconductors.

broadcom acquired enterprise software company ca technologies for $18.9bn in 2018 and then purchased cyber security group symantec a year later for $10.7bn, propelling it into the software sector.

in vmware, tan is targeting a company that is considered one of the cloud computing industry‚Äôs most important groups. its services are used by large corporations to manage private and public cloud networks as well as data centres.

broadcom‚Äôs acquisition would also provide a big financial payout for personal computer billionaire michael dell, who acquired vmware in 2016 alongside private equity firm silver lake in a $67bn takeover of technology conglomerate emc.

dell kept vmware independently managed from his personal computer and tech infrastructure company dell technologies, and the company spun-off its 81 per cent stake in vmware in november last year.

dell, who is chair of vmware, owns about 40 per cent of its outstanding shares, a stake worth about $24.5bn under the terms of the takeover agreement. he will roll half that stake into the new combined company, signalling confidence in tan‚Äôs strategy for vmware.

‚Äúthe way michael dell and silver lake are good at financial engineering, broadcom is as well,‚Äù said chalfin. ‚Äúvmware is an ideal currency.‚Äù",3,,Multai,0

1653632517,"what is traditionally considered your net worth is a terrible indicator of what stakes you should be playing.   


example 1 : you have a home worth 400k, 200k is paid off, and you have 40k in student debt, and 4k in your bank account/cash and a car worth 30k with 10k paid off and 20k owed. in theory your net worth is \~ 175k give or take a bit depending on the month and how values of the home or car fluctuate. 150-200k is enough to have 150-200 1k 100bb buy ins at 5/10. but in reality you have 4k, maybe less depending on how you budget for bills, and what non constantly re-occurring expenses you may have coming up.    


unless you are actually willing to call a ""buys house for cash"" company or go to carmax etc and sell off your house/car and buy a much cheaper version of either. or do a heloc for poker money, then the "" net worth"" you have in those isn't relevant.   
even worse if you are the type of person who has a 400k house with 200k paid off and consider that owning a 400k house as part of your net worth.   


your net worth as relevant to poker, should primarily consist of : cash either paper or in your bank account, cash like, easily liquid  assets such as your apple stock that you can sell any non-holiday weekday during market hours, that is in a personal trading account, not a retirement account that will incur penalties and is harder to access. i would say you could count your crypto that is easy to sell whenever you would like such as bitcoin, but be very careful to keep in mind it makes your net worth highly volatile.   


the easiest way to look at is ""cash"" honestly. especially if you are asking this question.   


with that said i play every stake between 1/3- 50/100 with the most common being 5/10 and 10/25. i have several 100 buy ins for 100bb for both of those most common stakes.   


the truth is though that if you are trying to move up in stakes you will be playing above your ""relative stakes to net worth"" for a while until you get established at the next level unless you plan on grinding for years before moving up.",1,,Gambling4gears,0

1653691420,anyone else noticed this morning that gma jumped  from low 6 to 24 dollars on apple stock ticker and after few seconds dropped down to normal?,-4,,No-Recognition9030,0
1653691432,"curious how that is different than any financial system in the world.  let's start with the stock market?  if the big ""whales"" sold apple stock all at once would the price of apple drop or stay the same?",0,,perfectson,0
1653692035,"the fact that in return for the spend, you get stock in return.

we often say stocks represent ownership in a company. in a way that's true, but i think it's subtly different than that. stocks are more like an entitlement to a portion of the assets of the company, except without any authority over those assets (they're managed by the company).  ownership means exclusive entitlement and control and stocks aren't like that!

it's instructive to think about how stock is created. the company issues stock and in return investors pay money (investment capital) for the stock. if the company was liquidated at that moment, the investors would be entitled to a portion of the money according to how much they invested. in this hypothetical case they would immediately get all their money back.

why do stocks change in price? because the only other way to get money from stock, apart from selling the stock to someone else, having the company buyback stock, or dividends, is for the company to be liquidated (for instance in an acquisition by another company). the liquidation value of a company is unpredictable and depends on the activities of the company after stock issuance. if the company is managed wisely the assets of the company grow over time. if a catastrophe occurs the assets of the company might shrink. the company is legally required to increase its value to shareholders. the price someone is willing to pay for a stock is based on a prediction of what they think the assets of the company will ultimately be worth when it is liquidated.

for example like gp said, let's say you have some apple stock and apple goes bankrupt. after paying employee wages and debt, the remaining assets of the company are sold off and the proceeds go to stock holders. and that is really what ownership of stock represents: the right to receive a portion of the proceeds from that sale. we can analyse but not predict how much money we would get from that sale and that's where the fluctuation and speculation of stock value comes from.",5,,afghx,0
1653692099,"i don't see your point. the possibilities to burn and re-invest are totally optional, you can also choose to just buy a pair, walk and cash-in, it's your choice. everyone has to decide on their own investing strategy, like with everything else, be it stepn, stocks or real estate.

using hypotheticals leads nowhere. your example wld mean stepn just stops working, shutting down app. it's like saying ""what if microsoft wld stop paying their staff? they wld leave and microsoft stock wld crash"". i mean, like yeah xd
nobody denies that we need demand for gst to have value. that's basic economics. doesn't mean it's a ponzi.

just to have a common base of argument, here's the definition:
a¬†ponzi scheme¬†(/Ààp…ínzi/,¬†italian:¬†[Ààpontsi]) is a form of¬†fraud¬†that lures¬†investors¬†and pays¬†profits¬†to earlier investors with¬†funds¬†from more recent investors. (wikipedia) 

does this happen in stepn? technically no, but kind-of yes sometimes, if the new investors decide to buy gst (but even then nobody *lured* them to do so). i myself i.e. have bought a pair of shoes with sol, never have bought a single gst. now we don't know what the seller did with the sol. maybe he traded for gst to mint the next pair, maybe not. we know someone is buying gst directly, bc there is demand, and that's most likely people wanting a headstart and quicker leveling or outside investors trying to hop on the stepn wagon. but both of those are not necessary to play the game, not even advertised for by devs and whitepaper. so i don't see how that part of the definition applies fully here.
and most important, how can this be a fraud if everything is transparent in the whitepaper and all those amas? ponzi is a form of fraud, so without fraud, no ponzi. simple. if the devs do sth shady and rugpull or sth, then yes, it was fraud. but they yet have to show such behavior.",1,,Kaladin_the13th,0
1653693482,"it seems like you don't have the basic fundamental knowledge here to be discussing the issue. the theory behind the value of international diversification is really obvious, and described in a first year finance or economics course. the evidence is also clear (one example https://seekingalpha.com/article/4240561-this-table-suggests-u-s-investors-be-well-served-international-stock-funds, another https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/fidelity-2016/five-myths-of-international-investing/1046/ and better https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/global-equity-investing-the-benefits-of-diversification-and-sizing-your-allocation-us-isggeb_042021_online.pdf) . 

it doesn't need to be some catastrophic thing, risk is more than that. if the pendulum shifts and some international markets grew faster than the us, exposing yourself to international markets will benefit you, more so than having some apple stock. 

having us companies intertwined with the global economy narrows the gap, but cannot fully remove the uncomoensated risk.",3,,Vedgelordsupreme,0
1653695776,"&gt;if all apple stock was sold at the same price it would drop but not anywhere near as much as if you did the same with bitcoin

ignoring the fact it is unrealistic for either asset to have a 100% selloff, your assumption is kinda doubtful considering many of the fortune 500 companies actually underperformed bitcoin in the last 6 months during this tech selloff.

&gt;apple is a revenue generating company with tangible assets vs bitcoin which is a currency

completely irrelevant when it comes to calculating market cap or assessing impact on price if there's a large selloff. quite a few revenue generating companies especially in the nasdaq index had 90% price falls in the last 6 months. many assets that are not income generating (e.g. gold) function the same way in terms of market cap and trading behaviours.

also, bitcoin is a very poor currency, so i disagree with your assessment of it being a currency anyway.

&gt;secondly there is far more money and therefore way more liquidity in traditional financial markets than in crypto.

the traditional market is way more liquid, but this is because it is also 100x the size of the crypto market.

again, i'm not advocating crypto is amazing or whatever, but this sub cannot fight misinformation using misinformation. the initial response i was replying to was simply not correct, as it misunderstands how the financial market calculates market caps.",1,,Garandou,0

1653697400,"i‚Äôm up voting your post and comments because i think it‚Äôs silly to downvote someone honestly trying to understand something better.

index funds direct your capital in a ‚Äúmarket cap weighted‚Äù way. this means that if you buy $1k of vtsax, then vanguard buys $49 of apple stock, $46 of microsoft, and so on according to the market cap (stock price times number of shares) of every company in the us stock market (see https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/vtsax/holdings/). tomorrow if apple goes to $0 but everything else stays the same, then your vtsax shares will go down by 4.9% and any additional vtsax shares purchased will not go toward any apple stock purchases.

while you‚Äôve heard a lot about index funds like vtsax on this sub, there exist many many more mutual funds (and etfs which are functionally very similar to mutual funds). companies like vanguard, fidelity, and blackrock (ishares) offer funds of all shapes and sizes. many are actively managed, some are index funds. for these companies, there is a fairly low bar to offer a new actively managed fund if they think customers will like the management strategy, but there is an extremely high bar to change the existing strategy of a fund. so a company trying to change an index fund into an actively managed fund would potentially be a financial crime due to how obviously negligent a decision it would be and how much it would undermine trust in vanguard as a company.

so in short, vanguard and its competitors offer many actively managed funds and they are free to start new ones if they want. there‚Äôs just no incentive to change an extremely successful existing fund like vtsax from index based to active management.",11,,amorous_chains,0

[interesting phrasing. in my experience, very few companies only focus on short term versus long term. that said, industries goes through phases of extreme innovation and it's the degree to which the company wants to/desperately needs to shift to the new paradigm. it is also a function of whether they can or cannot given the amount of personal money the owners have and their control over their shares and their board. so like, something like brk wouldn't blink twice if it had to make a significant change. (but he never changes, his model is far simpler, i.e. the beauty of brk).  in the case of meta and really all of the media stocks (para, disca, etc), all of them shifted sharply with significant losses that will last for multiple years. other examples might be ctxs has been undergoing such a shift for years, emn, dd, dow, etc... there are loads of examples at any given moment of companies that are either going through the transition or those that are coming out of it. in these cases, the ceo was not as closely attached to the company, so they were booted out and a new management team was put in because the board was not into it.  with aapl and googl, their business model is a bit different from metas. a lot different if we were fair to the two companies. this is why their financials are holding up a bit better than meta's. in both the case of aapl &amp; googl, the attack is not so much on their core biz and googl in particular has done a pretty remarkable job diversifying out the concept of what core biz means to give themselves a strategic bene. msft would be the other great example of this. it shows pretty clearly when you look at the way they lay out their revenue streams, i.e. the % of revenues and net income each represents. i kinda think of it like a centipede. if you have to cut off, spin out, or other extricate 1 part, you could do it quickly. similarly, if you look at how these guys lay out their financials, you'll see the part that is always going on for r&amp;d and the progress laid out pretty easily. i mean, it's not perfect, but it shows fairly cleanly. i think the company that does the best lay out of this within big cap tech is likely msft, though. you will want to look at both the 10k and the quarterly letters. this last quarter, all of them kinda did a revamp of how they show it, so look at both this year and last year for all of them (sorry... i know, it's a lot of work).  amzn has started to break out this way, but you can kinda tell they couldn't spin easily right this minute because the core retail business (the one that uses all the capital) is sucking the profitable pieces dry right now). retail (approx 70% of rev) has to be fixed, management is saying with some visibility in q3, but hopefully by q4. it's a problem. so they are also in a similar boat, with different issues though. the last mile delivery got a lot more expensive very quickly due to inflation (labor, fuel, capex, etc). before they could finish it up and they've had to figure out how to manage pricing in the face of a rather different biz model from other retailers.   meta doesn't quite have that. most of its business have a lot more overlap in their trajectory. they are all media (possibly with the exception of whatsapp, but really no). it really focuses on short format media. i agree with others who have made comments on the metaverse being an extension of where they are at.  hope that made sense the way i wrote it above.](/r/stocks/comments/uzghqn/are_large_caps_shifting_from_focusing_on_short/iabd5eh/)

1653756431,"i‚Äôll give you three that sit nicely in the middle as potential for growth and solid as dividend buys, from most dividend-y to most growth-y: 

(1) tyson $tsn has outperformed the s&amp;p both ytd and over the last 52 weeks, but it‚Äôs still pretty far below it‚Äôs 52-week high. low p/e ratio so not as overvalued as many still are. great business model whether we hit recession or not (because people are going to eat chicken/beef/pork)

(2) john deere $de has a solid buy rating from basically every analyst, probably because the average 12-month target is $431 compared to closing price friday of $360. with products that target agriculture, infrastructure and home building, they‚Äôre well poised to capitalize on global stimulus spending from the pandemic, housing shortages and food/fertilizer shortages from the russian invasion. 

(3) microsoft $msft is always a winner and nearly recession-proof with lots of growth potential, though it has a smaller dividend than the rest. first, most of their business is b2b which is a lot more stable than consumer cyclicals. second, microsoft is ultimately a mega-cap tech stock with all that implies in terms of growth potential. lastly, their ownership of xbox makes them virtually recession proof. while video games are consumer discretionary, if we learned anything from the last recession, it‚Äôs that video games are where gamers splurge during tough economic times.

1653757818,"second, the more pertinent point:

standard deviations.

so, you probably know what that concept is or means ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre just talking about basic statistics, a bell curve. that bell curve represents the world of possible probabilities of scenarios ‚Ä¶ 

1 standard deviation is basically = 68% of possible scenarios. 2 standard deviations is basically 26%, 3 standard deviations is something like a 2%, etc

this is more confusing than it seems ‚Ä¶
but i think it‚Äôs helpful to just zoom out and think about it for a second.

so, why do we care about standard deviations and bell curves.

well, as applied to options, we can use data that we presently know, to basically map out probabilities for the movement of a stock.

so, say msft is trading at $200.

we know more data about msft beyond just it‚Äôs share price, specifically we know it‚Äôs volatility, i.e. how quickly it‚Äôs price moves up or down. volatile stock = moves quick up or down ‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt know which direction, we just know how quickly it‚Äôll move. 

so, we can take the volatility and the current stock price and start to map out the probabilities of the stock moving over a period of time.  

by that i mean, if we know a stock is super volatile, it‚Äôs more likely to move further, up, or down, at a quicker pace of time , than say a stock that isn‚Äôt very volatile. and that‚Äôs where the standard deviation stuff comes in.

so, let‚Äôs say you wanna figure out how much msft is likely to move over the next 4 days (it‚Äôs tuesday, and you‚Äôre looking to sell an option expiring friday, obviously the shorter the timeframe the more predictable and accurate you‚Äôre likely to be)

there is a formula for ‚Äúexpected move‚Äù which will tell you how far a stock is likely to move, up or down, over a specific period of time. 

and since we know a lot of important information, we can figure that out:

so, we know the stock price

we know it‚Äôs volatility (this is based off of the stocks historic data, it‚Äôs just tracking the stock price over time to determine its volatility, here we‚Äôre specifically talking about ‚Äúimplied volatility‚Äù‚Ä¶ but for your purposes just think about it as volatility).

you can find a stocks implied volatility online, see here for microsoft:

https://marketchameleon.com/overview/msft/iv/

presently, msft has an implied volatility of 72%. 

we also know the amount of time we want to predict, by that i mean, we want to know how far it‚Äôs gonna move over the next 4 days (tuesday to friday).

there‚Äôs a formula you should learn, and i‚Äôll summarize it below, but read this link:

https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/standard-deviation

so, the expected move formula =

stock price x implied volatility 

take that number and multiply that by the square root of the amount of days you‚Äôre trying to predict the expected move divided by the trading days in a calendar year, 252.

so, for the scenario we are referring to is:

$200 stock price x .72 (72% expressed as a decimal)

= 144 

then take 144 and multiply that by the square root of 4/252

4 days is the amount of time you‚Äôre trying to guess the move on (thursday to friday), and 252 is the total trading days in a year.

so, 144 x (square root of 4/252) =

~18.142

what‚Äôs that tell us?

that tell us 1 standard deviation of msft expected move over the next 4 days (again, here i used a $200 msft stock price, so this isn‚Äôt accurate data, use the correct stock price when you do this).

meaning, back to the bell curve, in 68% if possible outcomes, microsoft will trade $18.14 + or -, $200, by that i mean, 68% of the time, it‚Äôs gonna end up between $218.14 and $181.86 ‚Ä¶ i.e. plus or minus $18.14‚Ä¶

so, as applied to the scenario we are referring, we aren‚Äôt just simply selling options blindly‚Ä¶ 

we know with certain statistical probabilities, since we know more or less how much the stock is expected to move between tuesday to friday. 

so, we can sell, say, a $220 call, because we know that in at least 68% of scenarios, that stock is going to be below $220, and statistical chances if it moving above that $220 becomes less and less likely. the bell curve would show you that it‚Äôs only say‚Ä¶ ~15% of the time to be above $220 by friday.

you can use this formula of expected move to sell ‚Äúshitty‚Äù options, that is, options that are statistically very unlikely to be ‚Äúin the money‚Äù at expiration, meaning above the strike price ($220) you sold.

so if you really like the stock and don‚Äôt wanna sell it, just never sell options that have a strike price within 1 standard deviation of an expected move. basically just sell options that have more than 1 standard deviation, and you can have a level of statistical certainty and confidence you won‚Äôt ever be forced to sell that stock.

and you can use this formula to go either direction, up or down, if you were shorting the stock for example.

and to my original point, if in fact you were selling an option that‚Äôs just at the edge of 1 standard deviation, well, as you know, stocks tend to go up and then sell off, or go down and then recover, the market overreacts then corrects, constantly.

so, if you did get exercised on your $220 option, it means that stock really moved up quickly, on the edges of the likely probabilities, and you can be fairly certain confident  that the stock is going to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù shortly thereafter.

as in, if msft moved upwards $20 in 4 days, and your forced to sell your shares, calm down, wait, and you can fairly certain it‚Äôs gonna come back down again soon, and settle again, say at $215, or $210.

now, buy the stock back at that price (and you‚Äôre still in the positive!, you sold it at $220)

you can even ‚Äúsell a cash secured put‚Äù and collect premium to rebuy the stock, basically just getting paid to go back into the position you want to get into again. that‚Äôs basically the same scenario we described above, (selling a call), but sort of like the reverse.

&gt;notch got way more money than jk rowling did for minecraft, especially when you consider he got microsoft stock as part of the deal which grew massively

and he is no longer financially tied to minecraft, the ip no longer belongs to him. he's still obscenely wealthy, richer than any one human being should ever be, but i don't support him or any of his ventures. jk rowling is still making income from her movies, shitty detective novels and merchandise.

&gt;notch didn‚Äôt even pretend to use his money charitably

they're both massive pieces of shit, i don't know if you think i'm here to defend him, but i'm not going to give rowling a medal for being marginally less of a sack of shit.

&gt;the estimate for her wealth is around 1b and 160m is 16% of that. 16% is not a drop in the bucket

if i donate 10,000 over the course of ten years and on the tenth year i have 100,000 in my account, i've not donated 10% of my total earnings. i have made and spent revenue beyond that point. and for a literal billionaire, it functionally is.

1653887150,"to expound on that, assets can be grouped in to 4 broad categories based on being productive and real. productive assets are things that generate money on an ongoing basis. either things that do so directly like rental properties, or ownership in things that do like stocks. non-productive assets are things that don't like gold, or crypto currency.

the advantage of a productive asset is that even if someone isn't willing to buy the asset at the moment for whatever reason, it generates returns. suppose for some reason you could no longer sell apple stock, not realistic but let's just suppose, maybe all the governments outlaw the sale. no problem, because instead shareholders could just receive dividends of the profits. apple is productive, it makes money, so it is worth having a stake in.

real assets are physical, tangible things like gold or land. non-real assets are intangible theoretical things, like bonds or crypto currencies. the advantage of a real asset is it basically always has worth because it is something that can actually be used. even if gold stopped being used as a hedge, its value wouldn't go to zero because it has actual uses for industry, jewelry, etc. so the value of a real asset can fall, but basically never drop to zero.

thus good quality assets tend to be productive, real, or both. real and productive assets, like rental properties, are high quality assets but often pretty expensive. non-real productive assets like stocks and bonds are more risky because their value can go to zero, but their productive nature makes them a good bet provided what underlies them is stable. real non-productive assets like gold and grain don't tend to make a lot of money if held over the long term, but they do act as good hedges because they have inherent value that people are going to want and some, like grain, are consumed on an ongoing basis.

then we get to non-real, non-productive assets like crypto. this is low quality, because it only has value if other people want to buy it. the only income is from the next guy wanting to buy it for more than you did. it can drop to zero easily, there's nothing real under it, and it produces no returns by itself. the only way for the value to go up is to find a ""greater fool"" to pay more than you did.",8,,Sycraft-fu,0

      ],
      ""operating-system"": [
        ""android""
      ]
    }

the `as [$k, $v]` unpacks each array to avoid having to use `$x[0]` and `$x[1]` syntax:

    $ jq '.common[0].value | split(""&gt;"") as $x | $x' common.json
    [

that capital (aapl stock)has been at ""risk"" for over 20 years. which is why i was able to retire early.  it will stay at risk up until china makes a move on taiwan. other than that i'm holding. 

as for the csp that will be 1/10 of what is on the cc side of the trade. i'd rather put that money there than let it sit in the bank being eaten up by inflation. 

and i closed out my very first cc early on friday when aapl ran up towards the strike (149). i still made a few hundred bucks. so i'm not sure how closing a position automatically assumes a loss. but i'm willing to learn which is why i'm posting here.

so what? are you saying that if risk is 20 years old it is no longer risk?

if you want to do some mental arithmetic and *discount* any risk that you took on for a different investment purpose, fine. it doesn't change the fact that, from the point of analyzing strats in general, not your specific circumstances, the money in shares is at risk. particularly if you compare to someone who doesn't have any shares and is doing compare/contrast with an all options strat vs. covered strangle/wheel.

&gt;once we see global depression when the dollar crashes

that's quite an assumption without any evidence. you assume we just all agree that the dollar is going to collapse? yeah maybe in 1,000 years but it will then likely be replaced by another fiat currency. i mean... if we're using history as a guide...

&gt;hard to argue that the current system of boom and bust cycles created by the fed

boom and bust cycles existed looooong before the fed. in fact the exist after the fed was created and into today in every specialties asset. you dont think btc has a boom and bust cycle? boom and bust cycles exist because of human nature. it is our psychology of the get rich quick fomo mentality followed by the scared of our own shadow when things start falling that creates boom bust cycles. actually the reason central banks were created were to lessen the impacts of the boom bust cycles by allowing governments to artificially stimulate demand in hard times. boom bust cycles will only get more extreme when you have no one stepping in when times are bad.

&gt;i disagree that hard money created income inequality 

i never said that. income inequality will always exist regardless of monterey policy. it will be worse under a global btc currency because the supply is fixed. it the us govt printed $20m dollars in 1776 and said ""that's all we are going to print. no more money will be created'. what do you think would have happened? would 1 cent today be valuable? yeah probably. would the 50 families who had the most wealth and influence at the time come to dominate the money supply? i can't imagine them not. where does that leave the 300 million plus people who have since populated the continent? where do you get your money when only a small few hold it? go ahead and argue this is already the case but inflation is a counterbalance and allows for new entrants into an economy. a fixed supply by design does not. 

&gt;due to constant money printing people are forced to invest in assets to preserve wealth

you mean like stocks, bonds, real estate? yeah obviously. that's a good thing because it moves capital from those who have excess to the people who have innovative technology and business plans. we invest our savings in retirement plans and investment strategies that are valuable. green technology has a wealth of capital they can use for r&amp;d because people realize the importance and value in clean renewable energy and invest in companies (directly or indirectly) to develop those technologies. investing in general is a positive for society not a negative. the lack of investment reinforces the status quo. 

&gt;many americans can't put money into the significant funds into the financial assets like the stock market 

of course they can. vti sells for $208 at the moment. obviously you have certain brokers like webull and robinhood that allow you to buy fractional shares. so etfs are in essence infinately divisible too, just like crypto. you don't have to buy one btc just like you don't have to buy one vti but clearly owning one share of vti is waay less expensive than owning 1 btc. 

real estate by definition will always be expensive but it also brings the most utility. you can live in your home. you can't live in your btc. 

&gt;we didn't see this income inequality when we were on the gold standard

of course we did! have you heard about rockefeller, jp morgan, andrew carnegie, henry ford? all during the gold standard. there was lots of income inequality. however to compare the lives of the common folk from the early 1900s to today is like comparing peasants to kings. that's not a good comparison when even now in a time of immense wealth inequality, our lives are substantially better than they were 100 years ago. even for the poorest of poor. 

&gt;bitcoin will be the greatest advocate for income inequality our world has ever seen

how? the rich can afford to buy more bitcoin. the poor can't. you said it yourself, poor people can't afford to invest. so if the money supply switches to something that is increasingly more difficult to get your hands on.... where does that leave them? the rich can decide to diversify their portfolios by purchasing 2 or 3% crypto which in some cases will translate to millions of btc. the poor will not be able to afford much of anything in btc so if the value goes up they will be left behind. how in the world does btc reduce inequality any more than apple stock or any other investment?",0,,smellyboi6969,0

lol. seriously. i takes you 5 min to search to realize how stupid this is. the blockchain is public, that is why everything is easy to track, like scams. very much in contrast to cash or banking. banking info while electronic and recorded is not public!

crypto should the the governments wet dream as everything can be tracked (which is my biggest gripe actually with ""cryptos"" and monero is the only real solution here for now). but you know what? especially politicians and their lobbyist absolutely have no interest in having all their transfers public and same the government. then the would suddenly become extremely accountable and all the corruption would be exposed.

all crime in cash, money laundering, corruption will dwarf these crypto scams. 

&gt; retail investors have collectively lost 100s of billions of dollars to crypto con artists.

citation needed. this sounds like a great misunderstanding of market cap and liquidity. just because a coin has $1 in value right now and because there are 1 mio coins in circulation, it doesn't mean the actual value of all the coins combined is 1 mio. the market cap is 1 million but not the value. because as soon as you start selling a lot the value will drop and the more you sell it will quickly go to 0. same with apple stock. if suddenly a big player starts dumping and other joins in, the price will plummet.

so if market cap of coin x is say 10 billion, and then an issue happen like with luna and it goes to essentially 0, it doesn't mean at all investors combined actually lost 10 billion.",-13,,SureFudge,0

you're raising a point i was not focusing on. an equity meltdown doesn't change the amount of money in circulation. equities are 100% money supply neutral, even with fees, dividends, deposits and withdrawals, its's all shifting money around.

just to make it clear an example: on the stock market. say a has $0, b has $100 and c $150, in total $250 cash and there are no stocks. a buys aapl at $0 at ipo, sells to $b at $100, $b sells to c at $150. a has now $100, b $150 and c $0, and c has the aapl stock bought at $150. so $250 in cash, $150 in stock. so we went from $250 cash to $250 cash plus $150 in equity value.

now you can replace stock with houses, paintings, whatever you like.

my main point is still the psychology effect: though no money is created, it's creating a feeling of wealth and influences the willingness to spent money and how they look at the future, the willingness to invest in businesses etc.

thought via borrowing against stock (gains) money is actually indirectly created, i don't have statistics on that (elon musk for the twitter deal, softbank with its alibaba stock). the easiest most visible one is retail margin. in april 2022 it was [$773 billion](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics).

that's of course not even 20% of the balance sheet money creation by the fed since 2020 ([about $5000 billion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/walcl)).

1654024496,"sorry in advance for the wall of text.

i'll preface this with saying, take this all with a very large grain of salt.

according to finbox fair value estimates using a few models, they calc amzn fair value as:

\- [5yr dcf growth exit model](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:amzn/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr): $2,348

\- [5yr dcf ebitda exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:amzn/models/dcf-ebitda-exit-5yr) \- $3,241

\- [5yr dcf revenue exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:amzn/models/dcf-revenue-exit-5yr) \- $3,065

\- [enterprise value / revenue](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:amzn/models/revenue-multiples) multiple - $3,108

\- [price / sales multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:amzn/models/ps-multiples) \- $3,340

\- [price / earnings multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:amzn/models/pe-multiples) \- $2,527

not to mention, their loss was mostly attributable to their rivian investment, which was also responsible for their gains the previous quarter, which has sort of distorted their financial performance and expectations pretty significantly, but at this point the market seems to have mostly digested that info already.

**looking at the same models for $googl**

\- [5yr dcf growth exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:googl/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr) \- $2,969

\- [5yr dcr ebitda exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:googl/models/dcf-ebitda-exit-5yr) \- $3,401

\- [5yr dcf revenue exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:googl/models/dcf-revenue-exit-5yr) \- $3,253

\- [enterprise value / revenue multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:googl/models/revenue-multiples) \- $3,072

\- [price / sales multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:googl/models/ps-multiples) \- $2,883

\- [price / earnings multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:googl/models/pe-multiples) \- $3,253

&amp;#x200b;

seems reasonable undervalued (if you accept the model's assumptions as reasonable -- inputs for each of the models are in there, and you can actually input your own assumptions and get the model to calc it as well which is nice. all the data is coming from s&amp;p global intelligence and i generally think they're fairly accurate and not unreasonable assumptions for the most part, but as stated above, take these with a grain of salt).

&amp;#x200b;

**now  lets look at $aapl &amp; $msft fair value estimates**

&amp;#x200b;

**$aapl**

[5yr dcf growth exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:aapl/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr) \- $158

[5yr dcf ebitda exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:aapl/models/dcf-ebitda-exit-5yr) \- $158

[5yr dcf revenue exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:aapl/models/dcf-revenue-exit-5yr) \- $139

[enterprise value / revenue multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:aapl/models/revenue-multiples) \- $130

[price / sales multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:aapl/models/ps-multiples) \- $135

[price / earnings multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:aapl/models/pe-multiples) \- $160

&amp;#x200b;

looks like there is fairly limited upside (\~6%) for most of these models, or its overvalued if you are looking at the dcf rev exit, ev/rev, or the price/sales models.

&amp;#x200b;

**$msft -- this one is all over the place tbh but will include anyways**

[5yr dcf growth exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:msft/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr) \- $466 (this one is kind of an outlier since their fcf growth is huge, probably overvaluing the value of the future cash flow tbh)

[5yr dcf ebitda exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:msft/models/dcf-ebitda-exit-5yr) \- $308

[5yr dcf revenue exit](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:msft/models/dcf-revenue-exit-5yr) \- $276

[enterprise value / revenue multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:msft/models/revenue-multiples) \- $257

[price / sales multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:msft/models/ps-multiples) \- $243

[price / earnings multiple](https://finbox.com/nasdaqgs:msft/models/pe-multiples) \- $302

&amp;#x200b;

looking at all of these, it at least seems to me that both $amzn and $googl have significantly higher upside potential from here than aapl and friends, and i don't think it has anything to do with their upcoming splits (especially since they have been known about for months and (at least in googl's case) aren't happening until mid-summer. i like using these finbox models to get a quick idea of fair value, and looking at the models and input assumptions, i think it's reasonable to believe that both amzn and googl are actually pretty undervalued right now, and it might explain these big jumps as institutions btfd knowing that they have big upside, whereas aapl and msft are actually pretty close to fair value, or slightly overvalued at these prices based on their current performance and future expectations.",2,,Its_the_dankness,0

there is a fund called vt that is a whole world fund, and it has us at around this same weighting.  vt would actually be a fine investment, but there are some slight tax advantages to vti/vxus combo instead (if in a taxable account).

put in more common terms, think about a company like microsoft.  they have offices in almost every country.  they produce products all over the globe.  their operations in many individual countries are likely large enough to constitute a publicly traded firm all on their own.  but they all roll up under the single microsoft stock and are considered ""us"".",1,,SCwareagle,0
