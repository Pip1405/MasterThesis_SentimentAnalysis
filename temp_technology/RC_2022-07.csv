1656641321,"i'm talking about profitable companies.  ones with real pe ratios.  much harder to value unprofitable tech.  although, unprofitable tech has been absolutely massacred.  most names in that bracket are down 80%+ from highs.

look at some of these names' p/e ratio...

* $meta: 11.2 (previous all time low 17\~ at bottom of 2018)
* $pypl: 23.59 (previous all time low 32.89 in 2017)
* $nflx: 16.19 (previous all time low 16.66 in 2011)
* $goog: 20.31 (previous all time low 21.82 in 2019)

tons of names like this.  trading at all time lows in multiples.  still absolutely dominating their sectors.  if some of these names dropped another 50%, you'd want to take out a second mortgage on your house to buy them.  

another 50% down puts $goog at a pe of 10.  $meta below 6.  these are companies that have grown revenue in 90-95% of all quarters on a yoy basis since their inception. a ""recession"" to them can mean going from 15% revenue growth to 5% for awhile.  

whenever things normalize, these companies will continue go grow faster than the market.",1,,chuck_portis,0

1656660324,"i don’t think this is a useful view. because you can’t tell. 

when the internet started to spread, people used computers to write letters, using a word processor, like word, and then they’d print that letter and mail it. all kinds of people ridiculed email, since “snail mail” was the standard and few people could see how written letters could be replaced by short electronic notes. 

when twitter started, it was an absolutely stupid idea to most people. you’re writing a post-it note essentially, and you could only use like 80 characters or so. lots of people didn’t get it. 

when facebook started, it was a kind of online dating network that didn’t call itself online dating. adult users were ridiculed because it was known as a platform for teenagers (this was when it first started accepting new users that were not in school). 

everything is always stupid or misunderstood or difficult to grasp in the beginning. and these are opinions often held by very smart people. the reason for this is because we can’t predict innovation well; there are too many factors to consider and we never have all the facts. so, with new technologies, it’s usually better to try to use them to solve problems, than pontificate about their usefulness. and even if you don’t know how to use them to solve problems, that doesn’t mean they’re not useful: they’re just not useful to you. 

if every smart person understood how useful an iphone would be, they would’ve bought apple stock and they’d all be outrageously wealthy now. 

if every smart person understood how useful any technology could be, they’d buy in as early stage investors and be outrageously wealthy now. 

but you know this doesn’t happen because we’re all not very good at judging how new technologies will evolve or be adopted. 

so, trying to judge whether decentralization is revolutionary or not is a futile exercise. there might be someone working in a basement right now building the killer dapp that will change everything. you can’t know.",3,,omniumoptimus,0

think about it this way

right now, 7/29 apple 100 strike put has a delta of 0.02. effectively meaning 2% chance that the option will go itm by expiration

what happens if really terrible news drops for apple? lets say that absolute doomsday situation comes out where its found out that for the entire time of apple, microsoft actually invented the iphone and they stole their proprietary info. apple stock drops to $90.

so is the probability that apple is going to be below 100 by expiration higher now? of course, because it literally is lower already.

its like guessing the probability that someone driving at 50 right now is going to be going faster then 65 in 30 minutes. if you make that bet, and then 5 minutes later the person is going 75, the probability they are going to be going faster then 65 in 30 minutes has certainly probably gone up.",5,,banditcleaner2,0

1656860917,"i'm somewhat new to the game and so far just in broad market etfs (vt equivalent in my country), but i'm considering allocating a smallish part to around 5 stocks. maybe around 20%. ofc with the hope to outperform the market, but realistically mostly out of interest. i'll gladly take feedback

my considerations so far are:

* something in the semiconductor space, since that's what i am somewhat familiar with:
currently leaning towards $intc , which gets discussed here quite regularly. they have a relatively low evaulation and it seems like there is a good upside if they manage to turn the ship around. i think they'll be fine on the chip manufacturing site simply because the west can't afford for them not to do well there. and mobileye also seems like a good asset they have.
but otherwise there are the other usual suspects to consider like $tsm, $asml, $amd, $nvda and the likes. or i could just go with a sector etf for diversification (but some associated managing cost)

* maybe one streaming service, since i feel like that's a market i use and can somewhat reasonably keep up with:
still deciding between $dis $para and $wbd . leaning towards disney to just buy and hold. but the other two also look interesting. not really interested in netflix though, even after their large drop.

* maybe one or two of the mega cap stocks, although ofc those are already a large share in my overall allocation due to their size. $goog seems the most attractive to me, since i think they still have room to monetize some of their stuff and to inovate. but apple, microsoft and amazon also all look interesting. i actually have a quest and like it, but i'm still not a fan of meta. so even with the huge drop and possibly good price because of that i'm probably leave that opportunity to others.

* the arbitrage opportunity with $atvi looks interesting. so i am considering buying into that, as i am decently confident it'll go through and the upside/risk balance seems solid.

* since i'm from germany i also wouldn't mind adding one stock from here (or at least europe). somewhat drawing a blank here though and could use some inspiration. maybe siemens? seems like a decent long term hold since their products will continue to be.

* i would like something out of the healthcare/pharma sector, but i don't feel qualified enough to make a good pick for small speculative picks. and i am not sure about any of the large ones like $pfe / $jnj or $tmo.",2,,golli123,0

for those of you on t-mobile the pixel 5 is a yay

for those of you on at&amp;t the pixel 5 is a nay

for those on verizon and you’re in a market with mmwave coverage the pixel 5 is a yay

https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en#zippy=%2cpixel

for those on verizon with no mmwave coverage in their area the pixel 5 is a nay

back to my original response:

if you are a verizon &amp; / or at&amp;t customer or on a mobile plan with an mvno that is using either of those networks i strongly caution you to go in a different direction.

what i’m about to say also applies to the pixel 4a 5g &amp; pixel 5a (i own the 5a as a backup device but i’m with t-mobile so when i purchased it a few months ago i knew what i was getting into.)

the pixel 5, 4a 5g, &amp; 5a all share the same s.o.c. with same modem

verizon has been rolling out c-band equipment onto their macro towers since the beginning of the year.

at&amp;t only within the last few months has started doing the same.

c-band is the wireless spectrum that both at&amp;t &amp; verizon spent billions on purchasing at multiple auctions a few years ago to be their anchor 5g bands across the country.

c-band support is physically built-in with the 3 pixel devices mentioned above but at the time of release google didn’t commit to enabling the support.

verizon meanwhile said they would be enabling the support in the future.

fast forward to march 2022 &amp; google announced in a google forum post that they would not enable c-band support with no explanation why.

https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-5-4a-5g-5a-verizon-c-band-support

https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991308/google-pixel-4a-5-5a-5g-c-band-pixel-6-software

around that time of the announcement verizon edited their support page to indicate that there would be no update for c-band.

https://www.verizon.com/support/software-updates-5g-ultrawideband/

all google has to do is enable the support for c-band with a software update and likely get the devices certified for both verizon &amp; at&amp;t networks.

why is this a big deal?  if you’re in an at&amp;t or verizon market that is getting the c-band upgrade you will see mobile dl speeds up to 700 mbps possibly more.  you will see reduced latency (less ping) and a much faster upload speed.  even if you’re not a heavy mobile user you should get a much better everyday experience in those upgraded markets.

if you’re paying that top dollar for an at&amp;t or verizon postpaid plan it just doesn’t make sense to use the pixel 5.

i am a t-mobile customer &amp; t-mobile did also purchase c-band licenses too but they did it to augment their existing spectrum licenses.  it was a limited amount of spectrum purchased.

n41 is the 5g band of the 2.5ghz spectrum they acquired from the sprint merger.  this is the band that will anchor their 5g network in the majority of their markets.  if your situation is this then i can recommend the pixel 5 as a daily driver.

if you’re a subscriber to at&amp;t or an m.v.n.o of at&amp;t i don’t recommend the pixel 5 as a daily driver.

if you’re a verizon or verizon mvno subscriber and you’re in an u.ltra w.ide b.and market with mmwave availability either the verizon version or google unlocked version should be ok.

https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en#zippy=%2cpixel

i just confirmed that both pixel 5 variants (verizon or google) do have mmwave bands built in.

what i don’t know is if the google version needs a separate update to enable them on verizon.

1657001014,"stocks are absolutely incomparable to crypto. 

the only similarity between crypto and stocks (and why they are running with the terrible argument that stocks are ponzi’s) is that public stocks are traded on a secondary market where you hope that someone buys your stock for a higher price than *you* bought it. that’s it. 

the public don’t really understand what buying stocks really is. when you buy apple stock, you aren’t purchasing the stock from apple but another person who owns apple stock. when the the company ipo’s, the company isn’t selling the stock but underwriters qua banks are. the underwriter buys the stocks directly from the private shareholders and the company itself *way before* the ipo. the underwriter hopes to buy the stocks cheap in the hopes that the stocks will rise upon the ipo. unfortunately, due to vc’s, ipo’s have become kind of a joke because they extract most of the value before the public gets a bite at the cherry (but that’s a whole different topic). 

when you own stock you have an *ownership* stake in the company.  you have rights and the ability to receive distributions (should the board approve it). becoming a public company also comes with a shit ton of rules to follow given the immense liability the company would have should it fail to disclose materially important information. 

crypto? you own lines of code that doesn’t confer any benefits. there are no disclosure requirements. no rights to holding crypto. 

so at bottom, the only similarity is that public stocks are traded between individuals or entities  who hope to sell their holdings for a higher price than they bought it. but even that isn’t apt because you can choose to go long and still receive distributions (should the company perform well) while holding the stock.",112,,restatementtorts,0
1657009272,"i hope you do enjoy that sort of lifestyle. 

but for a lot of people, like my close friend, it's more of hanging onto a time that was more simple and carefree.

my friend group consist of 4 people. i've known them since we were kids. we were inseparable growing up. we rented a house together and you know how they say don't have your closest friends as roommates because you'll end up hating eachother? yeah that never happened. we had a great 6 years in that house. going out at night after work, getting tore up, bringing girls back, throwing parties on the weekends. it was amazing. 

then we got to our late 20s. me and another one of the guys ended up hitting it big on the apple stock split (the big 7 way split) so we decided to run the lease out on that year of the house and we both bought our own houses and moved out. 

another one of my friends ended up getting a really good opportunity at his job and took a huge promotion and he also bought his own house. 

then, the other guy in our friend group ended up renewing the lease and moving in 2 other guys from his work into the house. he worked as a bartender (still does in his mid 30s now) and the 2 guys he moved in were in their early 20s at the time. 

they were not good roommates to say the least. to remedy this problem he decided to just always go out after work and just show up at the house late at night, sleep, and go to work the next day. staying away from the house as much as he could. 

while me and the other 2 guys became very successful over the years, all of us got married, one of us had 2 kids, we were really flourishing in our new lives. our buddy became a terrible alcoholic, got audited by the irs for lying on his taxes, got his license taken away for duis, ended up spending 6 months in prison and became a shell of his former happy self. a shadow of the man who could light up a room just by walking into it. 

now while 3 of us are very successful and stable, happy in our adult lives, anytime we bring around our other buddy it's just plain depressing. he's just always drunk, he gets into fights at bars, he blames us for abandoning him and ""leaving him to rot."" he's just a sad sight to behold. 

it really breaks my heart. for the first few years we were also sort of jealous of him. the freedom and carefree life he had was a reminder of the ""golden days"" as we called it. but as time moved on and we matured, he just regressed into this sad and angry man and we all love him, but he's just become so toxic and depressing to have around anymore. 

i hope your story doesn't mimic his. he was a great dude. deep down he still is but his alcoholism and refusal to grow up has ruined him.

edit: let me add that me and my other buddy who hit the apple stock split both offered to split the cost of sending him into a really nice rehabilitation center for his alcoholism and if he finished the program we were going to pay for him to get an apartment and help him find a good job so he could get back on his feet.

1657035473,"let me try to clear this up, companies create value but stock does not. you pointed this out yourself ""you don’t need any injections of fiat in, say, apple stock for apple itself to create more value by selling stuff"" the stock is disconnected from the value producing company.

the stock is paper, or not even paper today, without any financial guarantees. it is  not backed by the company itself like i learned it was as a child. probably due to some laws and loopholes.

to see an example of this do a case study on the btu stock (peabody energy the largest coal miner in the world). a short time ago they restructured. that restructuring included one action, wiping out all existing stock. stock holders got nothing. peabody energy then created a new stock with the exact same ticker and sold those stocks on the market. they didn't sell assets, didn't divide the company up, simply cancelled all existing shares.

stock is backed by as much as crypto is backed, nothing. you are right though stock price has a relation usually to how the company is doing, but in that sense crypto price has a relation to how it is being adopted or its perceived value by the public. which like with a stock can be rendered meaningless.

&amp;#x200b;

companies produce, stocks allow changing hands of paper (or digital ledgers now) about who owns what number of shares. the only way the person that owns those shares makes any money is if someone is willing to buy them for more than they paid, and then the same applies to that next person. the same as crypto.

1657047165,"&gt; that demand stays the same

where does this logic come from? the demand curve is completely independent of the supply curve. i could buy that they may intersect at different points to produce different prices, but... this logic makes my head hurt.

&gt; but supply drops by 50% because of the halving

supply just *slows down* after the halving, it does not *decrease*. it's still increasing (moving right), so if anything bitcoin should continue to get cheaper (by their logic), but just at a slower rate.

&gt; however, this argument fails to consider... [and] ... halving is already public information and thus should be priced in already

i have a feeling they fail to consider a *lot* of things.

just doing some back-of-the-napkin math. today, there are roughly 900 bitcoins mined per day at a cost of approximately $13,680,000. meaning the market needs to price bitcoin at *at least* $15,200 to be profitable for miners. well, between mining fees and transaction fees... either way, somehow $13,680,001 needs to be inserted into the system daily for miners to ""make money"".

    2,000 transactions per block
    144 blocks per day
    288,000 transactions per day
    
    17,280,000,000,000 ths/day
    120,000,000,000 ths/block
    60,000,000 ths/transaction
    
    $0.095 $/kwh
    0.0000083 kwh/th
    144,000,000 kwh/day
    $13,680,000 day

after the split, nothing changes *except* there will only be around 450 bitcoins per day. this means bitcoin needs to be $30,400 for miners to make a profit. what's going to be interesting is right now miners can still make money, but once the halving happens, the incentive evaporates. the $13,680,001 in costs still need to be covered - and i don't see any market mechanisms that would make the *value* of bitcoin go up just because the *cost* goes up.

so, let's assume bitcoin is still valued around $20,000 like today. that would be roughly $9,000,000 introduced through mining each day - meaning $4,680,000 would need to be made up through transaction fees. the bitcoin network can support 288,000 transactions per day. this means overnight, the transaction fees will have to go up to $16.25 to make up the difference. otherwise, miners will just stop mining as they would be losing money.

this isn't even considering capital costs - just operating costs. if you add in depreciation costs for capital, you could pretty easily double the costs that need to be covered. if we reverse engineer some numbers, we might get a good idea. today, transaction fees are a little over $1. we'll say $1 to keep the math simple.

($20,000 x 900 = $18,000,000) + ($1 x 288,000 = $288,000) = $18,288,000 daily revenue. we know the operating cost is around $13,680,000, leaving a daily operating profit of $4,608,000 to cover capital costs. if we make some wild assumptions that capital, overhead, and profit margins will remain relatively similar to today...

once the halving happens, $20,000 x 450 = $9,000,000) + ($m x 288,000 = $v) = $18,288,000 - $13,680,000 = $4,608,000. that looks complicated, but really we need daily revenue to stay the same (since daily costs will stay the same). so since we removed $9,000,000 in revenue from the mining side, we just need to make up an additional $9,000,000 on the transaction side. in other words, we need to generate $9,288,000 per day in transaction fees. **thus, a somewhat realistic expectation (assuming bitcoin prices remain relatively stable) is transaction fees will go from $1 to $32.25 instantly as soon as the halving happens.**",16,,pconwell,0

the reason behind this rally in the dollar is the federal reserve's hike in the interest rate and the expected interest rate differential between the two currencies has widened.

a strong dollar is disinflationary but will only lead to a minuscule reduction in inflation.

&gt;traders are betting the ecb will kick off their first tightening cycle in a decade later this month with a 25 basis-point increase, and deliver around 135 basis points this year. that’s down from more than 190 basis points almost three weeks ago. the fed in contrast has already raised rates by 150 basis points, with markets pricing in an 80% chance of a 75-basis-point hike at their july meeting.

1657185664,"&gt;if only there were funds to automate this. 

if you read below you’d understand why marked-to-market bond fund’s don’t work in practice, which is why so many investors try to replicate an index themselves through sampling….which is very difficult, costly and time consuming.

&gt;you’re allowed to ignore the price of bond funds the same way you can ignore the price of individual bonds.

what the fuck?? i can *maybe* understand ignoring changes in the price of individual bonds a person holds because if they’re held to maturity then as long as there is no default and the investor doesn’t need to sell them before maturity then there’s no change in the realised returns. however, bond etfs don’t have maturities, let alone near-term maturities. a loss is a loss, whether you ‘ignore it’ or not. if i am saving for retirement, the bond fund yields 4% but drops 20% in value just before i sell it to pay the bills then i have still made a very real loss. surely by the same logic it is true that as long as your stock portfolio keeps paying the same dividend consistently it doesn’t matter what happens to the price. this mean’s that you wouldn’t care if the price of your stock portfolio drops 99% in theory, as long as the dividend stays the same…right? you wouldn’t care, right?you can’t just ignore capital losses on stock etfs, so why should you be able to ignore losses on bond etfs…moronic. 

&gt;treasury bonds

true, but what’s the yield on treasury bonds again? 3% fixed?

&gt;depends on the type of bond

incorrect, unfortunately. the yield on bonds is almost perfectly correlated to the yield on stocks. this makes sense because if i am lending money to apple with a bond, the risk to me is apple defaulting from going bankrupt, and if i own apple stock…the risk to me is apple going bankrupt. maybe you can see the similarities there?? the only difference is the bond covenant gives creditors priority over shareholders in a liquidation, however, this is at the cost of a much lower (but fixed) return on investment.

&gt;do you have a plan for what to do if there is a bear market near retirement

yes i do, i am currently 22 and i am investing as much as i possibly can into a passive vanguard stock index, that is extremely diversified. if stocks do something similar to what they have done over the past 120 years then i should be looking at tens of millions by the age of 60, in which case the div yield on these will be enough that the price of the stock doesn’t matter, as the dividends will be enough to comfortably live off regardless of capital changes in the price of the fund.

additionally still, you’re not considering the tax advantage of stocks: with bonds there is a maturity date at which you’re forced to realise your gains and therefore pay tax on these gains, but because there is no maturity on stocks, gains don’t have to be realised until much later on, in which case you can compound returns on amounts that would otherwise have been paid out as taxes earlier on.",-2,,GrahamBuffettDodd,0

1657200232,"im not saying wait and buy after, im saying if you were to do that you would still get the extra shares. - nvidia faq below from https://investor.nvidia.com/investor-resources/faqs/default.aspx

what did nvidia announce?

  
we announced a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend, making nvidia stockownership more accessible to all.

  
did the stockholders approve the increase in authorized shares?  
yes, stockholders approved the increase in authorized shares during the june 3, 2021, annual meeting.

  
what is a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend?  
a stock dividend is a common way to implement a stock split. on the distribution date, holders of the company’s common stock will receive three shares for each share they hold as of the record date. the result will be a stock split where what was once one share is now four shares, and the trading price will be divided by four. 

what happens if i sell or transfer shares before june 21?  
if you sell or transfer any shares before the june 21 record date, you will not receive the additional stock dividend shares regardless of the sale settlement date.  


what happens if i sell or transfer between june 21 and july 19?  
if you sell or transfer nvidia shares on or between june 21, the record date, and july 19, the distribution date, **the additional stock dividend shares will go to the new owner and/or be distributed into the new account.**  


**what happens if i buy shares between june 21 and july 19?**  
**if you buy nvidia shares on or between june 21 and july 19, you’ll receive the additional stock dividend shares following a “due bill” process after the july 19 distribution date.**",2,,djsneak666,0

1657204367,"&gt;if you read below you’d understand why marked-to-market bond fund’s don’t work in practice

i read the below and don't agree with that blanket statement / sweeping generalization. you might find this writeup interesting: [individual bonds vs a bond fund](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/individual_bonds_vs_a_bond_fund).

&gt;however, bond etfs don’t have maturities, let alone near-term maturities.

no, but they have durations.

&gt;a loss is a loss, whether you ‘ignore it’ or not.

only if you realize the loss by selling. otherwise, price/nav dips reflecting opportunity cost of holding older bonds with lower yields are [temporary](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=360575).

&gt;if i am saving for retirement, the bond fund yields 4% but drops 20% in value just before i sell it to pay the bills then i have still made a very real loss.

yes, but that risk can be mitigated by (a) using the proceeds of that 4% yield (plus dividends from your stock holdings) to pay the bills; and/or (b) gradually shifting some money into lower-duration funds/vehicles well in advance of anticipated liquidity needs (e.g. short-term nominal or tips bond funds, t-bill funds, money market funds or hysas). requires some foresight/planning, but arguably no more than a custom bond ladder, and it's easier to implement.

if you were so inclined you could shift some money into a custom treasury ladder intended for anticipated expenses / liquidity needs, and then you wouldn't need to reinvest at maturity. but bond funds with appropriate durations are still the easier alternative, especially during accumulation but even during decumulation.

&gt;you can’t just ignore capital losses on stock etfs, so why should you be able to ignore losses on bond etfs…moronic.

first, you can (and likely should) ignore price drops in a stock etf when you don't need to sell, same as a bond etf. second, price drops in a bond etf are predictably temporary &amp; reflect nothing other than market-to-market opportunity cost that will shrink with time. the same exact way that market prices for a custom bond ladder would work.

&gt;true, but what’s the yield on treasury bonds again? 3% fixed?

depends on type (nominal or tips), term, and rate/yield environment. what's your point? a bond allocation provides ballast / lower volatility to help stay the course, rebalancing opportunities, and more-predictable liquidity. an investor interested in those benefits is likely to favor lower risk/volatility over higher returns/yield.

&gt;\[depends on the type of bond\]  
&gt;  
&gt;incorrect, unfortunately. the yield on bonds is almost perfectly correlated to the yield on stocks.

maybe more true for corporates (though ignores that a short-term bond issued by a growth company will behave very differently from its stock in response to changes to the risk-free rate), but my point was that treasurys are less sensitive or insensitive to many macroeconomic factors that influence stocks, and less correlated than corporates.

&gt;this makes sense because if i am lending money to apple with a bond, the risk to me is apple defaulting from going bankrupt, and if i own apple stock…the risk to me is apple going bankrupt.

true on the bond side, incomplete on the stock side (an additional risk there is that future earnings / growth expectations baked into the price you paid fail to materialize over time, and you significantly underperform alternatives with a similar risk profile). naturally, a company's stock can perform relatively poorly -- including underperforming its bonds -- without it declaring bankruptcy and defaulting on its creditors.

&gt;i should be looking at tens of millions by the age of 60

consider that your tolerance to risk/volatility may change as daily swings in your portfolio value approach several multiples of your annual salary, and any family obligations make this less of a theoretical optimize-for-best-case-outcome exercise.

&gt;the price of the stock doesn’t matter, as the dividends will be enough to comfortably live off regardless of capital changes in the price of the fund

weren't you just arguing against this line of thinking above? anyway, it might be worth keeping in mind that dividends are paid from earnings, aren't guaranteed, and there's a high correlation between suspension of dividend payouts and depressed stock prices when times get tough. it might be nice if some portion of your tens of millions were paying an uninterrupted income stream backed by the full faith and credit of various governments.

&gt;additionally still, you’re not considering the tax advantage of stocks

i didn't realize i was expected to list all the tradeoffs that you hadn't brought up originally. tax-advantaged accounts are a thing. even in a taxable account, it may be unwise to let the tax tail wag the investment dog and push you towards a riskier/more-volatile asset allocation that may be incompatible with your actual (not just imagined) risk tolerance, which may vary with investment horizon, portfolio size, and experience.",2,,Xexanoth,0

1657215911,"well, we do have some relatively good news about the reports.

1. although amd hasn't confirmed q2 2022 er date, it's rumored that they will be reporting before intel. intel has confirmed july 28, 2022. amd typically reports on a tuesday, so there's still a chance they report tuesday july 26, 2022. if they report before intel, and the report is good, i can see a big stock price boost on wednesday following the er, and then another boost on friday following intel's report. if intel's report is bad, it should boost $amd and if it's good, i think it'll also help $amd as it will likely help the semi sector as a whole.
2. nvidia doesn't report until mid august, so there's still a bunch of time until then. the good thing here is that rumors are that zen 4 is supposed to launch in mid september. if that timeline turns out to be accurate, i believe we'll start hearing some confirmed information from amd themselves a month or so before launch to hype up their upcoming product, and hopefully this is able to put amd investors at ease even if $nvda earnings aren't too good. if you've been keeping up with recent rumors, it's possible that nvidia will be delaying their next gen gpu launch, which will only help amd even more because there haven't been rumors of them delaying too, so it's possible amd can grab a good chunk of market/mindshare during that gap between rdna3 launch and lovelace launch.

1657218838,"honestly, my advice is to simply do some actual research on your own.

you want to know if it is smart to buy gold?   simply look at its history and compare it to actual investments (gold is a commodity, not an investment) and see what the data tells you.

for example, let's pick a random month and year.   july 7, 2012 ( a decade ago).

gold price was $1,592/oz

nationwide, regular gasoline averaged $3.43

apple stock was $21.60

duke energy stock was $107.56

median home price was a tick under $190,000

guess which one is worth less today because it can't keep up with inflation ;-)

well, to be honest, there are two:  duke energy and gold.  but at least the person that bought duke received 3.5% dividend year after year (it is a widows and orphans stable, secure, income stock)

the guy that bought the gold is holding the bag and lost a couple hundred dollars to inflation. just to break even, he has to get $2,026 per ounce.  after ten (!) years of waiting.  no thank you ;-)

this might sound like i'm shittin' on gold, but it is to show that gold is not an investment.  it is insurance against economic/financial disaster.  same as the fire insurance on your house.  i pay $1,100 year so that if my house burns down i can rebuild it.  gold is so you can rebuild the wealth you acquired by actual, financially sound **investing**, not mindless stacking. if you have no wealth or carry debt on depreciating assets you are not the smartest knife in the drawer if you drop significant money into gold.  the data doesn't lie ;-)

&gt;mosfilm is the leading russian film company producing almost all the film- tv- and video products in the country. the studio's production capacity is more than a hundred films a year. mosfilm produces, distributes and sells film-, tv- and video products. it also provides services relating to all phases of filmmaking.

&gt;most films are made at studios that are located at mosfilm. here works such famous filmmakers of russia as: v.yu. abdrashitov, s.s. druzhinin, v.v. menshov, v.n. naumov, g.a. panfilov, s.a. soloviev, a.i. surikova, a.a. eshpay, k.g. shakhnazarov, p.g. chukhrai and others.

...no, i used it because you, for some reason, thought it was in some way meaningful to rope non-human organisms into this discussion. nobody cares about the airborne microbes; they're not human. it's ""concocted"" in the same way you try to speak simply to a child when explaining something.

personhood applies to all human beings, i.e., [all members of our species](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/human-being).

&gt; those who disregard the humanity of (born) human beings would be historically most likely the same people who have the most repressive views on women’s rights.

sounds like we agree that they're wrong. thanks for helping me with my point about history. very few people believe that whether a person is born or not is meaningful in regards to whether you can kill them.

you are disingenuously implying that the anti-abortion ideology is about women's rights and societal roles, rather than the rights of humans in their earliest stages of life. you've likely been indoctrinated by rhetoric and now serve as a mouthpiece to spread disinformation about your opponents' motives.

example 2 is a taxable event.  whether that makes sense or not is irrelevant for purposes of what is or isn't a taxable event to the irs.

that said, here's the (current) logic:  crypto are treated as securities by the irs (same as stock in a company).  if you hand a broker a share of apple stock, and the broker gives you in return some amount of amazon stock, you've conducted a trade (sold the apple and bought amazon).  in your example, the party that you're handing the crypto to is acting as a broker.

the modified example 2 involving a friend:  if, as a business arrangement, you give your friend x crypto and your friend gives you back y crypto, then your friend is acting as a broker.  very dangerous for your friend, btw, unless they've actually gone through the process of registering as a broker.  however, if you gift your friend (without expectation of anything back) x crypto, and your friend later gifts you y crypto, then you've both given each other gifts.  that's not a business arrangement, as there is no expectation of return.  however, the dollar amount per year for gifts received is capped.  keep in mind, this would get rather fishy if you and your friend were constantly gifting each other different cryptos of equal dollar value.  not super likely they'd go after you, but if they had cause to investigate the existence of a gentleman's agreement (defacto business arrangement) they could.  if they did, and determined it was in fact a business arrangement, then your friend is once again a (presumably unlicensed) broker...  not good.

it would have been bigger if i went cynical trading mindset by buying more into high risk/high reward crony capitalism stock like $dito 2 months prior to my entry at ~3/share. in that i could have made $1m into $18.4m in less than 49 weeks.

going back in time further upon invitation of my friend i signed up in 2016 for a stock brokerage account to buy into the ipo of $hvn, a senator manny villar cemetery stock. i missed it by a few days. i had the wrong notions of buying at ipo prices only and not secondary market. i had liquidity to buy 1 million shares.

if i did that and held onto it until later half of 2019 i'd have a single company portfolio of ~₱0.5 billion.

i was always aware about the stock market prior to the pse's founding. used to watch the nightly news about the makati stock exchange &amp; manila stock exchange stock exchanges in the 1980s.

by exposure i slowly understood the principals behind a stock market. iirc back then they had a distinction between class a &amp; class b stocks and stocks that can be owned by domestic &amp; foreign shareholders

when amazon's ipo came up in in 1997 i was educated by mba friends of parents about paper gains and paper loses and why amazon was pioneering high risk growth industry.

that is why i dislike $tel &amp; other dividend stocks in 2016. they're lolo stocks that isn't future minded but today's retirement fund. when the stock market friends you surround yourself with are dividend-focused then you end up getting drowned out. 

i sadly realized this after a few years when i made the connection between their choosing to be unemployed, their spending habits and their love affair with $tel that had a lost decade cratering of stock value prior to 2020 market crash.

1657360848,"tesla’s (nasdaq: tsla) price adjustment from its stock split took effect yesterday, and short-sellers are feeling the heat from the company’s surge in price once again.

tesla shares rallied 12% on the first day of post-split trading after the trading volume was well above its daily average, with 115.6 million pieces of stock trading hands. the company’s valuation has continued to explode amidst the rush to buy tsla shares after the split occurred, and it’s not resulting in a lot of profitability for investors who are shorting the electric automaker.

cnbc described how short-sellers are continuing to feel pressure apart from the obvious fact, which is that tesla’s shares have grown exponentially in value in 2020.

when stocks are split, especially if the stock in question is heavily shorted, it can cause problems. whether the stock is put into a basket of derivatives or special financing is used on the short, things can get dicey because the price per share changes, the cnbc crew explained.

the issues do not usually affect retail investors who are shorting small amounts of the stock. the problems come more from large funds or companies that are shorting the company in massive figures.

whether the stock is being shorted based on derivatives or delta one products, which are derivatives that have no optionality, things can tend to go haywire, the team explained.

more relevant than not, the company’s surge in price yesterday also caused some issues for short-sellers, as it has done for the first eight months of the year.

according to financial analytics firm s3 partners, tesla shorts are down $25.4 billion in mark-to-market losses so far this year. with the adjusted price, tesla stock has gone from $86.05 per share on january 2 to over $482 this year. the surge in price can be attributed to tesla’s development of batteries and vehicle technology. the company’s energy supply and storage sector is also booming and has managed to grow this year, according to the company’s most recent quarterly earnings update.

additionally, shorting tesla’s stock is not an expensive move anymore. “it’s a very inexpensive stock to short, believe it or not because nobody wants to get in front of a moving freight train!”

tesla’s stock split was announced on august 11, and the primary intention of the move was to increase the likelihood that young people and employees of the company could get in on investing. many trading platforms reported issues with functionality yesterday, which could be attributed to both tesla and apple stock performing splits on august 31.",189,,YSLnoSTOPloss,0

tesla’s (nasdaq: tsla) price adjustment from its stock split took effect yesterday, and short-sellers are feeling the heat from the company’s surge in price once again.

tesla shares rallied 12% on the first day of post-split trading after the trading volume was well above its daily average, with 115.6 million pieces of stock trading hands. the company’s valuation has continued to explode amidst the rush to buy tsla shares after the split occurred, and it’s not resulting in a lot of profitability for investors who are shorting the electric automaker.

cnbc described how short-sellers are continuing to feel pressure apart from the obvious fact, which is that tesla’s shares have grown exponentially in value in 2020.

why is 5 years significant? you're cherry picking periods. if you choose any period-to-date after the big run up in 2020, investing in btc would have made you a big loser. any investment strategy solely relying on technical analysis (signals from past price patterns) is akin to financial astrology. it fails to incorporate any new information such as regulators coming down hard on crypto exchanges, the collapse of yield farming schemes, miners dumping their btc reserves, 142000 mtgox related btc about to be dumped, and of course tether's imminent collapse.

until you sell, you haven't made any money in bitcoin (just talk to madoff investors). the btc market is so thin and manipulated by wash trading that any large btc selling tanks the price of btc. many of those so called bitcoin billionaires were only ever paper billionaires. there was never enough exit liquidity for them to covert their btcs to fiat at any point. that's why btc's big price jumps mostly occur at odd hours on weekends  on thin trading volumes. you should get out while you're ahead. but go ahead, do your own research....",0,,baracka,0

their gaming business is understood to be cyclical, and to not grow as rapidly. the cloud industry, on the other hand, has been growing at about 40% year over year for the last several years and this is expected to continue for several more - that's where nvidia is trying to become the next tech giant. the crypto collapse is a sudden shock and it will impact the &lt;50% of revenue that is gaming but that's not completely unexpected. their stock price was already knocked down about 60% from the peak last fall, investors saw the correction coming and already made their bets.

1657503438,"there are two major methods.    
that result in different outcomes.  

and a hundred variations and points of view about how to arrive at a number, and how much the numbers mean. 
 
platforms often fail to disclose their calculation method. 

one method is to take the implied volatility value,   
which is annualized,  
and convert it to five market days, or seven calendar days, or one week,  
assuming you are looking at a one-week option, it now being sunday.     

lets say iv is 0.30 or 30%, annualized.   

to get a move for five market days, that is 5 of 252 days (more or less).  

the square root of 5 over the square root of 252 gets the move for friday, it being sunday now.    

sqrt (5)  / sqrt (252) =  2.24  / 15.9  = 0.14    

alternatively:   
 sqrt (1 week)  / sqrt (52 weeks) =  1 / 7.21 = 0.138    about the same.  

iv of 0.30 * 0.14 (move for 5 days) * 146.76 (aapl stock price) =  
expected move of  $6.16        


---  

another method is to take the cost of a straddle at the money.  

expiring july 15.    
aapl    
call ask for 147  is 2.29   
put ask for 147 is 2.25   
adding:  $4.54    

tastytrade takes 85% of that number,   
 for an estimated one standard deviation outcome, 
kind of like choosing an iron condor at 0.15 delta for both short strikes. 

other traders may take another number

0.85 * $4.54 =  $3.86

1657540809,"&gt; april 1st: aapl is at $180. and i sell a put for april 15th.  right away it gives me a $300 premium.

there are two components to a put: the ""intrinsic value"" and the ""time premium"".

on friday 7/8, aapl closed at $147.04.  during the day friday, i sold a $142 aapl put expiring 7/15 for $.81/share.  

that put has no intrinsic value - in other words, nobody would ever exercise it (right now) because they could get more money just by selling their aapl stock on the market than by making me buy it.

the ""time premium"" is everything in the price of a put other than its intrinsic value - in this case, the $.81/share i received.  (it actually dropped to $.70/share by market close, meaning i had an unrealized gain of $11.)

suppose instead i had sold a $148 put.  that $148 put is going to have both intrinsic value and time premium.  so i might have received, say, $2.70/share for that put.  $.96 of it is intrinsic value (because that put is $.96 above the price of the stock) and the other $1.74 is time premium.

so in my earlier example, i have no idea what a $180 put was selling for in april.  but i was just estimating that a put for two weeks out at-the-money would have been roughly $3/share.

&gt; but i'm confused on this part. - the idea of a put is for it to go above the strike price. 

no, you can do it either way.  if you sell it above the strike price, there's certainly more to be gained (if the price of the stock rises), but there's also a greater risk that you don't gain at all.

so in my example where i sold a $142 put for $.81/share, as long as aapl stays above $142, i have my maximum gain.  in other words, aapl can fall $5 this week and i'm still making my maximum gain.

if i had instead sold a $148 put for $2.70/share, in order for me to make that same gain of $.81, aapl can only fall to $146.11.  (of course, if aapl stays above $146.11, or even rises above $148, then i make even more.)

so it all comes down to risk/reward.  i personally like selling out-of-the-money puts (particularly in this market) because there's less risk (i still max out my profit even with a 3% drop in the stock price).

&gt; so if i sold it for $180 and then april 15th comes along and the stock is $165, wouldn't i lose money? not gain 1500?

1657577310,"regarding your pmc shooting weapons with large recoil, so many factors play into this..crouching/lying down alone will make certain weapons way easier to control...if you came from **any** other game, one habit you need to break is firing standing upright..i see too many do it and then fight the recoil while they try to kill a scav when they could be crouching and firing almost twice as fast in some circumstances.

next, weapon mods that improve recoil is one of the key factors of the whole 'progression system'.

and you can also max out ergo with your weapons too.

bsg likes their guns, they like adding new weapons, with that comes tons of mods, what better way than to have them help with recoil/ergo/durability burn/overheat stats.

you can level up your pmc to max -15% recoil control at elite level..however most usually don't get more than 2-5% recoil control on their character..that's stil a flat/base reduction in recoil control on any weapon which is substantial when you consider many guns only needs a few points to go from (holy shit!) to (this is alright).

also, don't have to go full meta, plenty weapons are fine with just a few light mods.

mpx just needs a slightly better muzzle brake, 2% foregrip and the ulss stock....you can go full long-barrel/greater handguard, meta muzzle and meta stock, but it hits diminishing returns.

i dunno about you but the base ak-74m doesn't needs any recoil control mods, that thing is so good stock...i dunno maybe i'm just used to using it...but if you add just a jmac, with a recoil pad, that is literally all you're ever need for that gun.

other weapons like the fal even at max recoil still have way too much sway..but at the same time weapons like the vector 9mm are nuts..become complete lasers at 100m with just some very basic mods.

all in all, it create an environment where you level up traders so you can gain access to better weapons but also better mods to make current weapons more fun &amp; easier to use.

it's a nice system tbh, especially when everything is centered around using weapons.",1,,SUNTZU_JoJo,0

does the mother even have to try to breastfeed? you're attempting to dodge an uncomfortable question.

&gt; your whole argument here is the baby dies and we are happy for it because the mother got to choose. you completely miss the whole part where the baby was alive and born. a part of this world a member of society and do all the protections there of.

no, you pivoted from the ""it's not a person"" argument to the bodily autonomy argument. at this point, you should know the difference.

&amp;nbsp;

pro-choice arguments:

- fetus isn't a person, therefore abortion doesn't kill anyone, and it's a non-issue.

or

- fetus is a person, but it can still be killed since it's violating the bodily autonomy of the mother. a tragedy, but still morally permissible.

&amp;nbsp;

the snowed-in cabin argument is in response to the 2nd pro-choice argument. the response to the 1st argument is simply to educate the pcer, references included at the end of my comment. also, why are you asking for my address? that's weird.

&gt; autonomy is about independence, self government owning yourself and not allowing others to dictate what you do with yourself. 

so how about the snowed-in cabin scenario? you've made both claims:

&gt; a part of this world a member of society and do all the protections there of.

&gt;  autonomy is about independence, self government owning yourself and not allowing others to dictate what you do with yourself. 

does the mother need to attempt breastfeeding or not? this is a hard question you need to answer, if you want to graduate from simply parroting the talking points you've been indoctrinated with.

one guy from a company called zann corp had suspected his company was being naked shorted so he decided to buy up all the shares for the entire company, and despite never selling any, he proceeded to watch millions of shares being traded the next day. that shouldn't be legal, but it is. one man owned the entire company - why were any shares being sold unless the owner decided to sell them? never mind millions. it's a fucking pyramid scheme. 

when i went to search for a source for you, the first link that came up was from all the way back in 2005. nothing has been done and this is still happening today ...

the reason i like buying msft over amazon is that both aws and azure make a comparable profit off of aws and azure ($20-30b+), meanwhile amazon has to spend more on their retail business, compared to microsoft that is generating recurring revenue from office 365 subscriptions. 

amazon could outperform msft stock-wise but that is going to have to come from amazon’s other businesses blowing up so much in revenue since they’re low margin. businesses like prime video with tv deals, and international retail are two catalysts i see.

qyld…what is it? it looks like it has a .32% yield. does that men that 95% of its yield is cash from selling ccs?

the only 2 stocks in their top 10 holdings that i own are apple &amp; microsoft.  these are great companies that pay double digit increasing dividends and buy back $10b’s a year. 

fb, tsla, paypal are not stocks i’d ever want to own and several of the others don’t pay dividends at all.   

it might make more sense to just include an allocation for microsoft &amp; apple stock.",3,,BRPGP,0

“human development begins at fertilization when a sperm fuses with an oocyte to form a single cell, the zygote.” -keith moore, t.v.n. persaud, and mark torchia; the developing human, 10th edition: clinically oriented embryology, (saunders), 2015

""the advantage of a scientific approach to the question of when life begins is that the answer is not based on opinion or personal values, but rather on direct observation. and in the modern age, we have very detailed observations, confirming beyond any reasonable doubt, that the cell produced by sperm-egg fusion (the zygote) is a human organism; i.e. a human being. we know this because immediately upon the binding and fusion of the gametes (a rapid event taking less than a quarter second to complete), the newly formed zygote enters into a sequence of molecular events that determine and direct its subsequent maturation and growth. the fact that the zygote autonomously initiates the process of embryonic development distinguishes it from a mere human cell and clearly indicates that it is a full and complete, albeit immature, member of the human species.""  -maureen condic, ph.d. |  february 13, 2017  [source](https://lozierinstitute.org/qa-with-the-scholars-science-and-the-beginning-of-human-life/)

""however, from a scientific standpoint, at the moment of fertilization of the egg by the sperm, a completely new organism is present. the organism is not a part of the mother’s body although he or she is located within the mother’s body. half of the time, the organism is a boy. the genetic complement of the new human being is unique and different from that of the mother."" -michael r. egnor, md, when does human life begin?

""although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... the combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. the embryo now exists as a genetic unity."" -o'rahilly, ronan and müller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29",1,,-Asher-,0

people were selling / borrowing against their stock comp for down payments. for the same mortgage payment, you can now borrow \~1/3 less. so if you had $500k for a downpayment from your stock comp, now you have anywhere from $50k to $375k, you can afford a much smaller mortgage, and your company is reducing hiring / freezing hiring / rescinding offers / laying people off (so you're less certain that the income that is affording you a much smaller mortgage will even be around). fewer new people moving in with big incomes since there's less tech hiring. overseas chinese demand is still depressed since they can't come over here right now.

1657672705,"fgo has hardly changed since day one? have you even seen what 2015 jp fgo looked like…? it was absolute garbage… and thus they fixed it. the expectation with live service is not just more content, but a better overall game. 2022 fgo is certainly more palatable than 2015 fgo or even 2017 global fgo. genshin is also the same, but the thing is while content is being delivered, service improvements have been minimal, evidently to slow down endgame progression even though endgame doesn’t require heavy investment. fgo has had numerous quality patches to speed up farming and progression, and even though 2015 fgo is an absolute shitter there is at least recognition that farming materials is a process that needs to be slowly streamlined and made faster and better. genshin on the other hand has done more to bottleneck farming than to enhance it, with the only minimal qol changes being increased resin cap and farming. is it a little unfair to compare a game from 2015 than to genshin from 2020? maybe. however, given the maturation of the gacha market, it should be evident to mhy that rolling out these qol patches sooner than later would make the farming process less tedious and boring as hell. though to be honest, this system of farming in genshin is probably to help hide the terrible endgame of just spiral abyss for developed accounts, and to artifically prolong the farming from ar45 onwards. both fgo and genshin have periods of downtime, but as mentioned below fgo is much easier to plan around with its rather plentiful ap system, and that gives players flexibility to minimize their playtime as their apple stock would probably be enough to catch up when farming is necessitated.

speaking of stamina/resin/ap systems; they suck. however this will probably not change as slowing progression without a daily energy system of some kind would cause content burnout. fgo at least gives more developed accounts a lot more stamina in reserve for big farming sessions, and also allowing better energy management. genshin not only has a middling resin recharge rate, but also has limited resin storage, as fragile resin is rare to come by past the initial stock.",6,,HonurableWulf,0

now, here is where i think the marketplace can function. i own rare items from the og seasons that new players no longer have access to and will never have access to. people that are new to the game envy the thought of owning some of the items i’ve acquired. if the items were to be in the form of nfts, fully operable for in game use, then i could potentially sell my any or all of my items in the marketplace. 

in this scenario, it’s not like you are buying apple stock in early 2000’s and holding 20 years to build a nest egg; but the market may hold a $5-10 average for most items and go higher for the more rare asset items. at a minimum, from the company side, it promotes more income growth from micro transactions as they would likely still get a royalty from each sale.",0,,therealtjhooper,0

1657731304,"why do we need a high short interest for this to happen though?

$amzn went up nearly 14% the day after their earnings early 2022, and at one point during the day i believe it was up 18%. was it heavily shorted before that happened? it looks like $amzn hangs roughly around a 1% short interest at all times, that's not enough for a ""short squeeze"", so the $amzn earnings must have been *that* good. (thinking back on it, i think they added in their gains on $rivn stock to their earnings, so they had a massive beat on paper, and i guess the bots bought into it?) 

in january, $aapl went up nearly 7% after earnings, that's a massive amount of money flowing into $aapl, and they didn't have some super massive beat iirc. 

of course an 8% jump is possible, but with how badly $amd has been hit recently due to a potential that guidance will be lowered / miss on earnings, don't you think a reiteration / beat / raise could send it up massively? $amd has experienced 8% days after earnings when the stock hasn't gone down massively leading up to er, so it's understandable to think that it could really pop off and double or triple that. again, i'm not saying it's likely, but it's not unheard of for a huge company to blast off the day after earnings, regardless of their current marketcap.",2,,yallneedjesuslol,0

1657735009,"first of all, if this feature will make it and in a proper way, that would be fantastic for the reasons mentioned earlier (so mainly separating unique and complex enough indicators useable in different scenarios, and composing their insights flexibly and reusable in any main indicator or strategy).

but it wouldn’t (or at least it shouldn’t) help with the security call limits as it is not the idea to misuse it as a workaround due to technical restrictions to only sneak in data by an otherwise useless „auxiliary indicator“ into an actual indicator. it’s like with any service architecture, where each service should offer one specific finite service, that actually solves one problem (not more, but also no less) and bigger more complex services should be composed by orchestrating these simpler reusable services.

so for a made-up example from some things i mentioned earlier:

a basic indicator (indicator 1) showing the open interest for a ticker has some use in itself. this may not be enough for a complex strategy based on multiple pieces of information, but it definitely gives at least this one usable piece of information, that can be used in all kinds of scenarios.

another basic indicator (indicator 2) showing the percentile within a certain period of time for each value from a randomly given input, also serves a purpose in itself. it shows, within which percentile apple is from its highest value in the last 5 years, if the given input is the apple stock and the selected period of time is 5 years, or it shows within which percentile the spread of the 50d ma and the 200d ma of the chart symbol is, if the given input is an indicator, that is calculating exactly this spread, etc. anyway, the indicator serves this one purpose on its own.

a third indicator (indicator 3) plots the seasonality of any given input, and therefore also serves a purpose on its own.

so, if i want to create an indicator or a strategy on a higher level, that combines several more basic indicators and in this example maybe gives a signal when the open interest of some ticker is within its 90% percentile and the seasonality is favorable as well, it, of course, needs to combine these pieces of information. in this example, i would therefore add indicator 1 to the chart to receive the open interest, and then apply indicator 2 on the output of indicator 1 to get the percentile of this open interest (and just by the way as another example, maybe i decide later, that it makes more sense to get the 90% percentile of some moving average of the open interest instead of the direct current open interest, in this case, i would just layer another indicator-on-indicator in between and apply a ma to the open-interest indicator and only then apply the percentile-indicator to the output of the ma), and then add indicator 3 to the chart to also receive the seasonality, and then i would add my orchestrating main indicator, that includes a set of rules based on any given percentile of an open interest and any given seasonality, where i would correspondingly deliver the outputs of indicator 2 and indicator 3 as inputs into this main indicator, to apply its calculations to them. this is the way, it’s meant to be and how it should be used.

but i don’t think, it’s a good long-term solution to regularly misuse this feature as a workaround to just sneak in data to support the creation of an actual useful basic indicator. let’s say, i would create such an indicator z, that relies on additional inputs from indicator x and indicator y (or that same indicator z with different settings to create the other part of the needed data as an input) as a crutch. how do you want me to communicate that to your end-users on the platform? „here is indicator z, to use it, please first add auxiliary indicators x and y (or a second time indicator z, but with a certain input configuration) with no purpose on their own to the chart and select them as inputs in indicator z, not because it makes sense to you (like in the example above, where the purpose of the composing indicator is to combine flexibly any percentile and any seasonality and therefore it will be logical to anyone, that you have to give him a specific percentile and a specific seasonality first), but just because otherwise it won’t work for technical reasons?“ i don’t think, this is a good long-term approach and just because this workaround is feasible, you shouldn’t consider any issue about limited security requests as being closed just because of this workaround.

and a higher number of plots is of course used for visualization as currently only one plot could be transferred into another script anyway (unless applying indicator-on-indicator-on-indicator-on-indicator-on… , which i wouldn’t do). for the reasons mentioned above, it would also be recommendable not having to use it only to sneak data into another script as a workaround for a long-term solution.",1,,RaymondM1989,0

1657743382,"it's a matter of potential.  for example, i like gold, but i don't own any because i think bitcoin does the job of gold and more, yet its market cap is 20x lower than gold's.  until they are at least equal, i won't be buying gold because there is simply a better opportunity with bitcoin.

ethereum and the others you mention are securities.  there are lot of great ones that are probably very undervalued right now.  but their potential market is so small compared to bitcoin's.  bitcoin will become a major global reserve currency and unit of account for international trade.  that market is currently in the hundreds of trillions of dollars (i hate even referring to it in terms of dollars, but for the sake of illustration, i will now).  on the other hand, something like cardano could become the world's largest nft platform, or maybe become the world's new way of governing real estate ownership via smart contracts.  i don't know, but i do know it won't even come close to what bitcoin is trying to be.  and cardano is not trying to.  they aren't competing.  bitcoin is an entirely different industry.

bitcoin is the only competitor in its industry, except maybe gold which is a joke.  there's hundreds of defis and smart-contract techs all vying for the same tiny slice of their respective industry.

i don't own layer2's or smart contract chains for the same reason i don't own gold or apple stock, even though i like gold and apple.  bitcoin is simply too undervalued right now for what it is going to one day become.

1657804099,"&gt; is their dna not human?

the dna in a spem or egg is derived from a human but it incomplete to itself be human. it is estimated that there is a 99.9% commonality between any 2 humans' dna. that is the difference between by dna and yours. or my dna and a fetus' is less than one tenth of a percent. we share about 99.7% of our dna with neanderthals and about 98.8% with chimpanzees.

i don't know anyone who is prepared to argue that chimpanzees are human. so if we ball park it to a 99% or greater genetic match to be human than a sperm or egg with only 50% dna falls well short. while a fertilized egg has approximately enough of a genetic match to any other human as you and i do.

&gt;it's good that you acknowledge they can be understood as organisms, at least.

that is the basis of biology. organisms. you are one. i am one. a fetus is one.

&gt; they carry the amount of dna adequate to their stage of the human lifecycle. i think we both agree size and number of chromosomes should not be a factor in rights. 

dna is not a factor in if or what rights a human has. but is is absolutely a factor in if an organism is human or something else. dna is essentially instructions for the cellular operations of a biological entity. if i give you directions to my house but i cut out 50% of them are they still directions to my house? or somewhere else entirely?

&gt; i think development matters, but if you don't, you have no reason to exclude them. they depend on specific environments to move to the next stage, but dependency isn't morally relevant to you.

if you say development matters i point you back to my original statement how once we create a arbitrary marker for what point in development is necessary it could just as well be anything. 

one may decide having a heartbeat it the developmental marker. someone else may say being conscience of your own existance.

it's a great argument to keep the debate going. but again once you make some marker you are excluding some people which undermines the value of human rights because it means we could move that marker and start excluding anyone on a whim. or as john f kennedy put it, ""the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.""

&gt; ...we already consider people with extremely low intelligence unfit to make their own decisions and thus deprived of most rights...

are you saying that someone who has a mental handicap should not be allowed to live?

&gt; the universal declaration of human rights says all humans are ""born free and equal in dignity and rights"". it says nothing about before birth. ultimately, the two are working with two different standards for ""a human"".

is that quote really relevant? in what context? morally? legally? as far as i know that has no legal bearing. 

&gt;you need to look at the rationale as well: ""[humans] are endowed with reason and conscience"". the reason we strongly protect humans instead of, say, crabs, is not pure biology: it's about our mental and social faculties.

if that's the basis you want to go with then the mentally or socially handicapped have no rights. neither does a [1 year old child](https://www.parentingcounts.org/baby-begins-to-develop-self-awareness-15-24-months/)

i think it makes much more sense to turn to biology to answer this.

the developing human: clinically oriented embryology, 6th ed. keith l. moore, ph.d. &amp; t.v.n. persaud, md., (philadelphia: w.b. saunders company, 1998), 2-18:

""[the zygote] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. **a zygote is the beginning of a new human being**. human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. this highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.""

ok then, tell me a time when the dividends earned from a public company covered the cost of the price you paid for the share. 

if i purchase one apple stock today (valued at $144 usd right now), next year i will get a big fat dividends cheque worth $0 from apple. so i invest $144 and i get zero profits back. nice. 

if profit is the main motivator/driver, then why are shareholders content with almost negligible dividends - real, tangible profits - paid out by public companies?

why are investors motivated by profits which they will never receive a single cent of?

you know, if i buy a local restaurant, i expect the actual profits from daily operations to cover my initial investment. i don't hope for its stock price to go up to make money. 

the bottom line is, investors in the stock market only care of the stock price goes up and could care less about the actual profits. if a company is in the negative but the stock goes up, stock market investors would still be very satisfied happy.

1657810600,"&gt; its not a ""system"" that coerces you to work, its nature, its the very fucking laws of physics

in nature you can go out into nature and farm, hunt, and forage for yourself. what homeless person today can go out an farm, hunt, and forage for themselves? there is no land for them. even if you assume that you could go do this, you need something to start - land is a capital investment.

we live in society. as much as you like to believe in rugged individualism, nobody born today is born into ""nature,"" they are born into ""society,"" where the rules of ownership, work, responsibilities etc. are all determined by the system that has evolved from centuries of human interaction.

and so it's perfectly reasonable to question whether the systems as they are today are fair or reasonable or moral. 

&gt; but the reality is that nothing in life is free

you obviously didn't read my other responses. my suggestion is not to make everything free, my suggestion was to make everything given to someone, entitled to them, through purchase of some sort of shares. if i owned $1000 in apple stock in 2019, i would have earned around $2600. is that being given to me for free? the only difference here is that we are currently in a growth midnset economy, where i am suggesting that the investment required to get to subsistence dividends, a ""basic income"" will become vanishingly small as technology improves. imagine working for 6 months and saving $5k, which buys you a share in a local vertical farm, which provides all the fruits and vegetables you need every week. this is what i am talking about. 

now, you could equally say, if i can buy a $5k share in a vertical farm and feed myself, then a rich person could outbid me to $6k, take all the food for himself, and sell it back to me for more than $1k profit. that's what we need to avoid. we need to avoid allowing the creation of a system which unnecessarily coerces people to work by creating artificial scarcity. we already see this in the housing markets - whales are shutting smaller investors out through competition. should they be allowed to do that? is that efficient use of society's resources? obviously, it is not.",1,,chcampb,0

1657814540,"&gt;i believe this would be a great short term buy and sell.

buying and selling what?

if you're buying $atvi for the expected arbitrage gain, you're not selling anything. merely waiting for the all cash deal to go through.

if you're buying $msft, expecting the deal to go through and the company to turn more profit from the newly gained ip's, that's not a short term timeframe.

if you're $atvi, it's because you don't think the deal will go through and probably locking in a loss. selling $msft, however, over this is locking in a significant loss for a rather silly reason over fears of a deal for a gaming company not going through. $msft is more than that.

&gt;my reason for short term buy: the sale will most likely go through.

ridiculous assumption. this is an arbitrage bet, not all turn out.

&gt;my reason for short term sell and not rebuy: activision has a pretty toxic dev and player base.

activision could be run by satan himself (or any other malevolent religious figure) and perform human sacrifices at company hq **but as long as it turns a profit**, that's just noise. try to avoid letting emotions get in the way of investing.

&gt;another reason is greed. the price will immediately jump up and then other people will sell causing a price correction. do not try and time the markets.

this is literally trying to time the market.

also as a disclaimer, being someone who has money invested in this arbitrage bet, i expect the deal to go through sometime in the tail end of 2023. i can't think of any issues the ftc will bring up, considering that microsoft isn't going to pull games from rival platforms (and has no reason to) and the cwa has publicly [endorsed](https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-supports-microsofts-proposed-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard) the acquisition.  

as a $msft shareholder, i'm not to terribly upset at the price. $95 is a little higher than i'd like, given the current status of some of their ip's, but i can see potential down the road.",15,,RushingJaw,0

1657819884,"i don't know, we can agree that ballmer had no vision (or bad vision), but i don't like nadella's microsoft either.

since nadella took over, software quality dropped to the floor for me. windows 10 felt like windows 95. they have fixed some stuff, but even today if i clear my recycle bin when it contains many files, dome don't disappear even if they're actually deleted, i need to refresh the ui. win+arrows keyboard shortcuts don't snap windows correctly the first time (they're a bit off the edge of the screen) and i have to do it a second time. dpi scaling sucks even after years. the modern/classic settings dichotomy is a mess.

it's great they embraced open source, but it looks like they ditched testing in the process. i stopped using windows because i got tired of it all.

as for the cloud, i have no experience with azure, but i can tell you they bought  hockeyapp, replaced it with their own appcenter, and by the time it got to feature parity they basically abandoned development. no new features, only maintenance. and distribution to app store connect has been broken for a week now.

tesla is very volatile, very difficult to tell where is a good entry point or exit point. why trade tsla instead of those better trading vehicles?

**fraudulent activity by voyager:**  
they claimed they were a brokerage and now in their filings they are not. not a good look legally when the sec finds out.  
they also stole our crypto and now want to give us back vgx. when i give you money for apple stock and you decide to give me some worthless fake stock back, that's fraud. another example, i give money to an apple store for an iphone and that apple store decides it's actually a used tech store and gives you back an off brand nokia phone, that's fraud.  
court's will also prove that voyager does not own our crypto - their tos will probably not hold up, especially if they claimed they were a brokerage from the start.  
they shouldn't have accepted deposits in june when they knew they had no funds or crypto but they still scammed people and stole our money then froze the accounts.  
they are being investigated by fdic for fraud - they had false advertising.  
false marketing about customer's owning crypto. yes this is a crime in the financial world. you cannot write whatever you want in your tos and then market it differently to gain customers for your scheme - you are committing fraud.

i own a (very small) portion of the company but i'm only entitled to $0.00001 per aapl stock and $0.01 per amzn stock ([par value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp)), if any (depending on the state).

the company can produce real money without the stock rising (like brk-a, goog over some years) or the stock can rise with the company making huge losses (tsla). 

it's all possible because the stock price isn't linked to the companies gains, it only depends on the dollars new investors put into the system. if they're gone, the stock becomes practically worthless, no matter how the company is doing. 

even though you can make some nice gains by gambling in it, to me it still looks like a ponzi scheme/game of hot potato and it shouldn't be promoted as a safe asset for pension funds, 401ks or passive etf-investing in general.",1,,rest_me123,0

when you buy a stock share, you don't own part of the company. you're only entitled to the [par value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp) of the respective stock ($0.00001 per aapl stock, $0.01 per amzn stock) or nothing at all, depending on the state. the only source you'll get back your dollars are other investors.

stocks only exist for companies to raise money that they don't have to pay back. once the stocks float out there, it's up to the new ponzi inventors money to raise the price. they can just print new shares whenever they want and collect new fiat money from the investors.

&gt;the stock will continue to represent the value of a fraction of a lumber mill or whatever.

we don't know what a stock would be worth in a hypothetical scenario, a stock can go to zero as well, even when the company still makes money. it's all up to new investors putting dollars in. if that liquidity is gone, the stock is worthless.",1,,rest_me123,0

1657943903,"for starters, there's plenty reason to think that nvidia stock is going to be doing well since they are going to be launching their next line of gpu, and they are under contract with nintendo to provide gpus for up to 10 years, they're about halfway through that deal, and there's probably going to be a switch 2 announced sometime within the next year.

and secondly, he's buying nvidia stock as it was falling down because their attempted acquisition at buying arm fell apart just a few months before that. 

and lastly, nvidia isn't remotely close to being tsmc's biggest buying for manufacturing supply time.

apple, alone, buys 25% of tsmc's semiconductor fab time at their most high-end fab.

mediatek, amd, qualcomm, and broadcom all own more fab manufacturing time than nvidia, who only purchased 2.8% of fab time. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-becomes-tsmc-third-largest-customer

all of those customers have multiple types of processors. amd makes both cpus and gpus. they make alot more product because they sell in multiple markets.

and if this ""massive chip subsidy"" gets passed, there is not going to be a new fab plant built until years from now. it takes years to get one up and going.

nvidia is not going to have access to increase manufacturing capacity anytime soon. there are no new fabs in the near future. this subsidy being passed is not going to cause nvidia's stock to jump up or skyrocket.

irgendwann genauer hingeguckt und skeptisch geworden, weil das angeblich gesperrte stück nur mehrere hundert meter lang war, die autobahn aber zwecks umgehung schon hunderte kilometer vorher verlassen werden sollte, was wir wie gesagt bereits gemacht hatten.

whenever apple customers create a value proposition to non-customers they view it from their personal experience or use case.

most common unsaid &amp; said excuse not to switch is /r/pcgaming

another excuse is that the computer isn't sold at [~$700 msrp](https://www.statista.com/statistics/722992/worldwide-personal-computers-average-selling-price/). most people do not want to spend more than that on any desktop/laptop that they will [replace in 5-6 year](https://www.pcworld.com/article/415068/the-pc-upgrade-cycle-slows-to-every-five-to-six-years-intels-ceo-says.html). so if you bought a 2022 laptop today then odds are you will replace it by 2027-2028. this is unreasonably long as apple has stated that [macos devices are used up four years at  a time](https://www.apple.com/environment/answers/).

apple tends to only serve the top 20% price bracket of any market they enter. makes sense as it means less work for higher margins. good strategy for $aapl shareholders who were able to buy at 20y low of $78.20/share in jan 2009 then held onto it for a the current 52w high price of 182.94/share

if you were to compute for the pre-28-for-1 split per share 52w high price then multiply $182.94/share by 28.

that would make that initial $78.20/share investment into $5,122.32/share if no splits occurred from 2009-today.

last 4 quarters had a total annual dividend of $0.89/share.  pre-28-for-1 split per share dividend would be $24.92/share.

1657980684,"bill gates was a ruthless, cutthroat businessman who made his vast wealth by using every dirty trick in the book (and inventing a few new dirty tricks along the way) and then using microsoft's success to effectively hold the computer industry hostage for 20 years.

he viewed any successful non-microsoft software as a threat, even if that software was for windows. and if that software was cross-platform he viewed it as an existential threat, since it lessened people's dependence on microsoft.

internet explorer? microsoft didn't make it. they completely missed the boat on the world wide web, and with the popularity of the netscape navigator web browser (which was available on almost every computer, from $20k sgi workstations to macs to windows pcs), bill gates &amp; co saw a threat to microsoft's dominance, so they rushed to get their own web browser by buying one from a company called spyglass software. now, since netscape navigator cost money, everyone assumed microsoft would charge for internet explorer, and microsoft's contract with spyglass software promised to give spyglass a cut of whatever money they made from internet explorer sales. so what did microsoft do? they released internet explorer for free, which was something none of their competitors could do since microsoft had such deep pockets. spyglass software was ruined, and so was netscape eventually. once internet explorer was available, microsoft threatened not to sell windows to any pc manufacturer that bundled netscape navigator, which would later get them in trouble with the department of justice and the eu.

directx? began life as an opengl knock-off that would (microsoft hoped) lock-in developers to windows. hell, microsoft was so afraid of opengl (since it was cross platform and the industry standard at the time) that they offered to partner with sgi (creator of opengl) on a new, cross platform graphics library called firegl. except that microsoft had no intention of actually releasing firegl. they hoped working on firegl would distract sgi from advancing opengl long enough to let directx (then called direct3d) catch up to it, and when their plan worked microsoft just up and abandoned firegl.

when 3d accelerators were new (which are now called gpus), there was a much larger number of companies developing desktop gpus than the nvidia/amd/intel tri-opoly we have today, and many of them were too small to afford to create their own full opengl implementations. since most pc gpus at the time only implemented a small subset of opengl in hardware, microsoft wrote a full software opengl implementation and then offered it to gpu companies, so those companies could just replace the parts that their gpu implemented in hardware and still have a full opengl driver. once they had all spent a good deal of time doing this, microsoft actually refused to license any of their opengl code for release, effectively guaranteeing that smaller gpu companies would only have support for directx.

video for windows? vfw (now called windows media or whatever) only came into being because microsoft literally stole the source code to quicktime for windows. both microsoft and intel were having a hard time getting video to play smoothly on pcs, when apple surprised them both by releasing quicktime for windows, a port of their quicktime video framework for macintosh. quicktime for windows could to smooth video playback on ordinary pcs with no special hardware, and microsoft and intel were caught completely off guard by it. apple had contracted out to a 3rd party company to do the windows port of quicktime, so what did ms do? they went to the same company and gave them a ton of money to develop video for windows, but an insanely short schedule, knowing full well that the company would essentially have to re-use a lot of the quicktime for windows source code to get the project done on time.

when apple found out (their contract with the other company stated that apple owned all the quicktime for windows source code), they went ballistic and sued microsoft. microsoft had been caught red-handed and knew that apple had them by the balls. so ms settled. remember when microsoft ""bailed out"" apple in the 90s by buying $150 million in apple stock? despite what the tech press reported, that's not what actually happened. the $150 million in non-voting apple stock that microsoft bought was part of their settlement (apple was no longer on the verge of bankruptcy by that point, and didn't need to be bailed out). the settlement also had microsoft agreeing to port ms office and internet explorer to macintosh.

so a lot of people my age tend to view bill gates' recent charities as an attempt to whitewash his reputation and, in a way, buy his way into heaven.

1658027175,"so that issue is actually a lot less damning than people are making it out to be. he didn't just buy stocks, he executed call options, which makes it a lot more complicated. 

for those unaware, call options are basically a contract to buy shares at an agreed upon price by a specific date, or the contract turns back into a pumpkin. call options specifically are a contract to buy 100 shares at a specified price (called the strike price) that is above the current price per share. the inverse is called a put option where you agree to sell the shares at a strike price regardless of current market price. with these options, you have 2 ways of making money. you either sell the contract itself and someone hopes it continues to grow in value--either the share price continues to grow for a call or the price continues to sink for a put. the other is to exercise the option to buy/sell the shares yourself.

it says paul pelosi executed these moves in ""late june"", so i'm going to assume around monday june 27th, when the stock was trading at $170 a share. over the last 6 months, nvidia stock has dropped \~39% in value, and over the last year it has dropped \~47%. in the month of june alone nvidia stock prices dropped \~$20 a share. in my mind the only way exercising a call option would make sense given these facts, is if the options were most likely bought when nvidia was trading for substantially less than they currently are with a strike price that was notably above the price at the time--that means when you're exercising the option now you are paying notably less than current price per share. it says he made ""$1 million to $5 million"" off exercising the option. assuming that $170 per share price, the stock alone was worth $3.4 million. in order to make money we have to assume he was not paying $170 a share. if we assume he paid $140 a share, bringing the total ""profit"" to $4 million, it sounds a bit more reasonable.

now, how far back do we have to look before we find a point in time in which a strike price of $140 was notably above the market value of nvidia stock, which means the call options would have been cheap and relatively safe investments? either mid-2020 or earlier, or if he got really lucky march 2021. well before this bill was ever being discussed. this was likely a long term investment bought with no plan to sell the option and with every intention to just exercise it near the end. if he had wanted to maximize money, assuming he bought these options around those time frames, he could have sold the options themselves when nvidia was trading at $300+ a share, and would have likely made a lot more money.",12,,neurosisxeno,0

&gt;they also stole our crypto and now want to give us back vgx. when i give you money for apple stock and you decide to give me some worthless fake stock back, that's fraud.

lol no, they didn't steal anything. again, all that is stated in their user agreement that you agreed to. you keep shouting ""fraud"" too much. it is baseless. maybe, look up the definition of fraud. mr. fraud expert. you gave them money. you were informed of the risk. they became insolvent and filed bankruptcy. none if it is fraud. do you know how many companies have gone insolvent and filed bankruptcy?! and investors lost everything?  no, they were not charged with fraud. that's called being in business. companies go out of business all the time. you are insane.

&gt;court's will also prove that voyager does not own our crypto - their tos will probably not hold up, especially if they claimed they were a brokerage from the start.

lmao their tos will not hold up? lmao who are you? you have zero legal background based on your comments. and zero understanding what fraud means. 

&gt;they shouldn't have accepted deposits in the month of june when they knew they had no funds or crypto but they still scammed people and stole our money then froze the accounts.

means zero. prove that it was intentional deception. lol you won't be able to because you don't even know what fraud means. you are just spewing so much nonsense.

&gt;they are being investigated by fdic for fraud - they had false advertising.

lol now you are a financial crime expert too. lmao no, you are literally full of shit 

fraud in law, is intentional misrepresentation of fact for the purpose of depriving someone of a valuable possession. intent is very hard to prove and that is needed to prove fraud. nothing you said proves intent. moreover, most shit you said literally nonsense and makes you look crazy. also, this is for court and the law to decide not for a 2 year child who lost money on investment with zero legal background shouting ""fraud"" in capital letters. you screaming fraud in capital letters in each comment does not make it so. just makes you look crazy. i think, you are doing coke and or drunk.",4,,Ill-Upstairs-2147,0

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the zygote and early embryo are living human organisms.

&gt;&gt; keith l. moore &amp; t.v.n. persaud, before we are born – essentials of embryology and birth defects. (w.b. saunders company, 1998. fifth edition.) pg 500

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; embryo: the developing organism from the time of fertilization until significant differentiation has occurred, when the organism becomes known as a fetus.
&gt;&gt; cloning human beings. report and recommendations of the national bioethics advisory commission. rockville, md: gpo, 1997, appendix-2.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.

&gt;&gt; o’rahilly, ronan and muller, fabiola. human embryology &amp; teratology. 2nd edition. new york: wiley-liss, 1996, pp. 8, 29.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the development of a human begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.

&gt;&gt; sadler, t.w. langman’s medical embryology. 7th edition. baltimore: williams &amp; wilkins 1995

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; based on a scientific description of fertilization, fusion of sperm and egg in the “moment of conception” generates a new human cell, the zygote...this cell is not merely a unique human cell, but a cell with all the properties of a fully complete (albeit immature) human organism...a living being.

1658066989,"&gt; for example, say there is one 100 call contract. the stock price has risen to 105. i obviously know that this option has made money, but how is the money made exactly?

some corrections:

* we need to know the premium price (how much it cost to open) to know if it made money or not. if you paid $1 million for the call and it loses $12000 a day to theta decay, it is far more likely to have lost money than gained it to a 105 stock move (assuming it started at 100).

* we also need to know the moneyness of the call at the time it was opened. if the stock started at $42 at open, making the call far otm, a rise to $105 will make a lot more money for the call than if it started at $169 itm and fell to $105.

* but if you meant it started at 100 and ended up at 105, the call **may or may not have made money**. it isn't a sure bet that it made money just because the stock went up $5. again, starting and ending premium price of the call is the most important factor here.

explainer for why a call doesn't necessarily make money just because the stock goes up: 

**faq: why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably?**

* [options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)

-------------------

now, to answer your question, it's actually quite simple. the reason a call contract gains value is *because the market bid the price up*. that's it. that's the whole reason. if the price of the call was originally $2.00 and the stock went up to $105, the market might decide it is now worth $2.69.

when the market thinks a contract becomes more valuable, the price is bid up. if the market thinks a contract becomes less valuable, the price is bid down. price is discovered through trading. that's the beginning and end of it.

&gt; is the call sold back to a other buyer?

that is the best way, yes, though who the buyer is doesn't matter. if you buy shares of apple stock and later sell them, do you think you sell those shares back to the same person you bought them from? no. your mental model is you sell them on the open market. options work the same way. so just think of options as stock that has a deadline. you trade them the same way, buy low, sell high at a later date, but before expiration. if you can't sell high at a later date, because the call's value was bid down, you might end up taking a loss. exactly like shares.

&gt; or is it exercised and now the trader and buys shares for 100 and then immediately sells it?

the big bold advisory at the top of this page is basically never exercise your option contracts and don't hold option contracts to expiration.",1,,PapaCharlie9,0

the fact that shares give you ownership of profits is what prevents prices from getting too too insanely low.   even though a particular company may never do buy backs, or pay dividends, if profits are significant enough, there’s no way the shares would ever get cheap enough to allow someone to just buy a seat on the board for $1.

crypto, on the other hand, can go to zero and it doesn’t change shit for investors.   apple stock as it stands right now can never go to $0.000000001/share because an activist investor will just buy 100% of the company before it ever gets that cheap.",10,,Notyouraveragebull71,0

don't use logical fallacies, that's a dumb move, putting words in someone else's mouth.

&gt;delayed adulthood-adolescents in the 2010s were also less likely to drive, drink alcohol, go out without their parents, **and work at paid jobs compared with adolescents in previous decades**.”

ding ding ding! bingo! it doesn't make sense working at low paid jobs at all these days, 2008 made low wage unlivable. that's one of the things that set the female compas awry - just like the boomers, they get quotas and sponsorships for ""equity"" and complain why men who don't get such things sit on their ass ""not working a normal job"" ""not getting a real degree"". but that's not true, the trend of female ""social studies"" degrees was continuing steadily from the 70's and sexlessness was not such a big issue. also [share of young adults not working or in school is at a 30-year low in u.s.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/29/share-of-young-adults-not-working-or-in-school-is-at-a-30-year-low-in-u-s/) so it's not that either, it's a bit on the low side, but it's the same as it was in early 90's and i don't remember 30% of men not getting laid in the 90's.your second link is broken, though, it is disproven by my first one, there's no noticeable decrease.your last link is pure gold, though:

&gt;but whatever the direct effect of education on never-married men, the primary cause of the rise in sexlessness is simply the increasing delay of marriage.

[age of marriage's been declining since the 70's and marriage rates were dropping since 80's](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-get-married-later-2013-10) so again, why the sexlessness shoots up after 2008 like an apple stock?wtf? these poor fuckers don't even get to stick it in, how are they supposed to get married? this is idiocracy stuff 101, especially with a graph that shows that men with higher education are more likely to be sexless. the whole article is stigmatizing the entirety of the men claiming all sexless men are the worst posts of /r/incels . this is blatant and weaponized misinterpretation, which dances around the fact that \*something\* changed the dating scene around 2008.it isn't about tinder or bumble, yes, it's about freedom of communication that allows women to interact with men of all calibers all the time, abundance produces more greed and selectiveness.

(3) prices on stuff moves a lot, who decides what the taxable value of apple stock is if it changes all the time.

1658148509,"here’s a good analogy:

i once got it explained like this. imagine you can buy a box with a growing amount of money inside it. you don’t have the key to open the box, therefore you can not get the actual money, but some people do have the key. so if you knew this box would have double the money inside it in 5 years you would probably buy it even though it in no form is helpful to you. but in 5 years you can sell it to somebody who has a key for maybe double the price you bought it for, because they are willing to pay more because there is more money inside the box.

so who are the people with a key? 
it is the large investors. the people who can buy so much of a company that they get rights and can impact and get profits from the company.

let’s simplify it. if apple stock cost 1 dollar, the big guys would buy so much of apple that they control everything, take all the profits, decide that the company should be named pear and workers need to be dressed as zebras. but the company is worth more therefore you can’t get a major impact with little money

1658166117,"yes and no.

use divo for example, it has 27 stocks in it, of which 23 or 24 are on the djia, so if it followed the underlying stocks you should see movement similar to the djia. what you will see is movement in the same direction, but generally not to the same levels.

this is for three reasons.

1. stock prices are truly driven by supply/demand economics. in simplest terms the buying and selling of divo drives the price. i mean the supply/demand of the stock itself, not the supply/demand of the goods a company is selling. so if you thinking of aapl stock as the goods of divo (the underlying stock) that price has little to do with the price of divo. it really comes to is divo a desirable product on the market right now, do people believe that it will produce the yield consistently, do they want it in their portfolio. if every buyer of divo all decided to move to jepi this month, the stock price would continually go down no matter the price of the underlying stock. divo, jepi, schd are very well run funds that tend to move in the same direction with the market because consumers want them in the portfolio. qyld does not tend to move with the qqqm (the etf it wants to track) and i am not sure why. it has exceptional volume and has good companies in it, but all of the global x funds under performed the etfs they hope to track. (you will actually see that most people on here are not fans of qyld).
2. markets move together. markets move on sentiment and news. right now there is little news that is negative that we don't know about (already priced in inflation, potential bad earnings, covid, etc.) and we are in the beginning of the next earning season, so the market most likely is going up the next few weeks. now when the major market movers in sectors come out with bad earnings (such as jpm last week) the whole sector will dip for a bit as people fear that is a sign of the whole sector struggling. just as if aapl and msft came out with a bad report the s&amp;p will move down with them because they make up 12.5% of the s&amp;p when combined. all that to say as the market is trending positive most etfs that track along with them will too.
3. the strategies they run selling covered calls effect the price and dividends. if they continue to miss on the covered calls they sell and lose potential upside investment the fund will lose support.

if you want to see what i mean get divos holding list and plug it into the backtest at [portfoliovisiualizer.com](https://portfoliovisiualizer.com), you will see that it will track the exact pattern with the underlying stocks but but in the end divo is down almost 5% to the underlying holdings. when you look at the monthly returns you will see a difference in the portfolio returns. portfolio value wise you are better off owning the stocks individually, but you would need a lot of money to get the dividend returns that divo does. and when you don't reinvest dividends you do much worse owning divo, although you have a higher dividend return.

so yes in most cases they move the direction of the stocks they track, but no the stock itself does not effect the price directly, buyers do.",3,,mypuptuck,0

1658197485,"&gt; we should base our 1040 on how we define a person, certainly. 

[people are trying](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/absent-roe-v-wade-will-qualifying-child-mean-more-tax-code)

&gt; so why can’t we force someone to breast feed another persons child? why can’t we force women to gestate the hundreds of thousands of frozen embryos in storage? 

if a mother is stranded at a ski lodge with her baby, with food but no formula, is she required by society to at least try to breastfeed? or can she return home with the corpse and high-five her friends for exercising her right to choose what to do with her body?

&gt; but if an organism is how you define a person, then an an embryo is a person. say you’re in a building that’s on fire, and you stumble into a room with a 5 year old and a case of 1000 human embryos in test tubes. you can only save one and escape from the fire or you all die. you’d obviously save 1000 human lives over 1 right?

at that ratio, i'd probably save the embryos, but i'm not sure what ratio is the threshold for me. 1:1, the 5 year old for sure, same with 5:1. i'd also save my friend or family member over x number of strangers, or a child instead of two extremely old people. do you have any arguments that you thought of yourself, instead of regurgitating trolley problem thought experiments you found on reddit?

&gt; so then you get to the definition of an organism, which has to be alive. much like viruses, which aren’t alive, fetuses can’t survive without their host. not a life, not an organism, not a person. 

i'd point you towards the basic biology. you wouldn't believe how many ignorant redditors i've cured.

1658199745,"obligatory i'm not an expert disclaimer. 

1.$qd is a small-cap penny stock and rs/rw analysis on these kind of stocks tends to be unreliable. i personally scan for stocks above $20 and i know some members on here scan for stocks with a floor price of $10. this produces a list of stocks with more predictable price action which is overall easier to trade. given how far this stock gapped up, it has entered a range of unpredictability that makes it incredibly difficult to play without a solid strategy specifically tailored to gappers (i personally don't have one and therefore don't make trades on aggressive gaps like this). 

* but the largest point here is that the market was trading in a choppy environment up until 12:45 pm est so any trade taken at this point should've been with the abundance of caution. i recently watched a video by pete where he stated that, when price action creates an area of s/r and that area is constantly touched, then there's a higher probability of that s/r being broken as opposed to a reversal from that price level. for today, $spy created an area of s/r at approximately $387.25 and i personally wouldn't have taken a trade until this level was broken and we saw confirmation of a new daily low. 

* $qd is a good pick as it broke above a 200ma and confirmed the break today. the stock also shows increasing volume across the previous 4 days. when looking back on the previous 5 days of price action, we can see that $qd traded flat while the market dropped and then produced a full-bodied bullish candle when the market showed signs of trending up. however, $qd does not directly confirm or show rs/rw in a reliable manner and therefore would've been a difficult trade to make/recommend. 

2.$spy gapped up and flat-lined for several hours. for today, i marked the intraday high and intra-day low and waited until $spy broke above the high or the low. for today, $spy broke below the intraday low and confirmed this break with the next 2 bars. once it broke below its intraday low, we could've logically assumed that $spy would work on filling its gap and, in this case, a logical take profit would have been at the previous day high which is where the gap would've been filled. 

3.$nvda does not show rs/rw on the daily chart for me personally and has had declining volume across the previous 3 days so its current uptrend is not supported by volume. $nvda also has a 50ma at $168.9 and i would have personally waited until $nvda broke above it's 50ma to enter this trade. 

* in this case, you bought a $167.5 call which would require the stock to not only break above its 50ma but maintain that break and trend further upward for you to make a reasonable profit. you are putting a lot of burden on the stock to trend higher to make this trade worthwhile and this is unlikely as it has a significant ma as resistance and has hardly any volume to make a potential ma break possible.

i'm talking about the big ones i'm talking about well let's talk about gmc.

gmc along with the other car makers had a little bit of a problem recently because they factored into their future plans based on covid that there would be less purchases of automobiles. so they locked in contracts and deals with their distributors that included distributors of silicone chips. as it turned out there would be a great demand for car buying that they didn't predict and suddenly those chips and the contracts that would have secured them were passed off to other companies and the car makers could not obtain them anymore or if they could they had to obtain them at a higher cost and you know it just created this cascading shortage that went down the line but gave an advantage to some other industries that aren't really talked about in the discussion of the chip shortage. there wasn't a chip shortage i mean the chips were there they were being manufactured silicone was being created it's just there was a cascading effect on on what we perceived because the people having the advantage when especially the automakers opted to renew these contracts or not renew them at least they would buy less silicone or they just didn't buy it because they thought well what we'll do is we'll manufacture cars without the chips ride this thing until it's done and then we'll pick up the contracts after that and then we'll pop the chips into the cars and rolling out the door and so they were manufacturing cars that were incomplete in storing them warehouses but then suddenly there was like this want for replacing your car. that's why the used car market got totally fucked up. if it weren't for and let's be honest people that didn't vaccinate themselves suddenly no longer needing a car i don't think i would have even been able to purchase a used car when my dad stole mine so and i know that because i looked at the history of ownership and it was like one owner the car was like the top trim it looks like mint condition it was like a 2012 model it didn't have that many miles on it it was mint no worked on never been in a wreck and i could tell this was somebody's like retirement vehicle you know and i was like crap i'm buying somebody's car from up north that died from this disease you know great.

at the very least i knew it wasn't buying a car from here because quite a lot of cars were erased and and and started to appear up north and way down south that had a lot of flood damage covered up when harvey rolled its way through the south. but then a year before that and a year before that and a year before that we had historic floods like there was like since 2015 forward there was like back-to-back-to-back store floods it was really weird and it seems to correlate with climate change seeing as this is now the hottest july on record and beating last year's record which beat the record before it i think you know where this is going. people might say well joseph you contributed to the problem you work in oil and gas extraction and i would say well yes i do, what i don't work in is the carbon capturing industry and then they would say what carbon capture industry and i say exactly that mysterious you know extremely fucking valuable heavy industry that never has popped up for some weird reason even though it's absolutely essential to our survival and it would be worth a fortune because these devices would be installed all over the world and they could essentially reverse climate change while still burning fossil fuels so where is it? hey elon musk, instead of like manufacturing electric cars for people that can afford to actually buy a house and simply offsetting the carbon emissions to someplace else as well as contributing to you know disparities in africa where a lot of the rare earth elements for the batteries and such are mined... instead of like trying to replace nasa which could really use that money and returns about five times the value back into the public why don't you invest all them billions in carbon capturing industry because currently you've got no competition it's totally up for grabs. no i'm not saying that i understand more than a out of touch billionaire trapped in you know a bubble of yes men and and empty suits and not at all i swear.

but i can say that they got a lot of people working for them that's need jobs and one of those jobs is the outlook the financial impact of things what is given in a stock perspectus what is given when a shareholder meeting happens the 5-year plan and beyond. amazon microsoft all the tech companies google apple all of them that have to if necessary deal with a decentralized internet if you don't think they have not factor this in their plans you're out of your tree buds.",1,,randomevenings,0

1658229669,"so this is a big misconception. step up in basis applies to the individuals inheriting the assets. you're parents bought apple stock for $10/share and when they pass leave it for you and it's price is $100/share, your basis is now $100/share. if you'd ever sell, your capital gains tax is calculated based off your basis of $100. the government has this rule because of the estate tax. because your parents were assessed estate taxes on their net estate, they allow the inherited to avoid that being double taxed whenever you would pass.  

where the problem really lies is that not many people pay the estate tax because there is a roughly 12 million exemption per individual. so a husband and wife together get their first 24 million in assets, excluded from paying the 40% tax. all this on top of lawful estate planning strategies such as grantor retained annuity trusts, charitable remainder annuity trusts, etc. that are used in order to transfer wealth to younger generations and avoid estate taxes. 

the original build back better bill actually tried to address a lot of these strategies, but was scraped last minute.

being a tech nerd my whole life i was also early in video games and personal computers throughout the 80's.  my initial foray and belief in atari and tandy hype didn't go so well after the video game crash of 1983, but my patience and beliefs were eventually paid off when i put some small amounts into apple and microsoft stock in the late 80's.  at the time, apple and microsoft were still very new and pretty volatile.  it still took a while and apple almost went bankrupt in the mid-90's, but patience, staying active and in the loop with new tech developments the long low-risk approach eventually worked out pretty well in the long term.",49,,CONSOLE_LOAD_LETTER,0

i feel this way too, except it depends on what your definition of mundane is. from recording ownership deeds to fractional ownership/dividend disbursement there's a huge potential for blockchain to really transform a few industries. i agree though it will seem mundane in comparison to how we view it today as an investment like apple stock in the 80s that will secure a future for a generation that has no other hope or options.",1,,sterphles,0

if you look at it through the lens of the folks who buy foreign debt, an overextended us economy is like apple stock on a rare dip. do you really want to bet that the biggest economy in the world is going to default on its debt?

infinite money exists as long as the prospect of betting on the us defaulting is a shitty investment. economic output is a much better indicator of whether the us is actually doing something that would wreck the value of its debt.",0,,miseducation,0

1658246680,"i think their main issue when comparing btc to apple is really simple. apple stock may be a piece of paper but this is based on the valuation of apple itself, and that  is an actual product(s)  that apple designed, made, sold.  the usd is backed by the us government, even gold has utility beyond being a store of value,  like jewelry, electronics etc 

dont get me wrong, these guys are dinosaurs, like many at the time they might have said the telephone was stupid or that cars were dangerous contraptions that will never replace the horse, don't invest in either one.

the problem right now is that to most involved, we can see the innovation and possibilities but in terms of adoption and utility its early days. it reminds me of early days of the internet, i am sure munger would have said it was dumb and  a fad that will be gone in a year or two (as many did) .

\- one thing i am taking away from this past cycle is that a) that real decentralization and debanking  has taken a serious step back, not to mention all the pathetic grifter, ego maniacs who set themselves up as blue chip entities and just rugged us because they were greedy and could do it, i am talking about luna, celsius and 3ac and all those complicit (who isnt ?) 

\- a huge chunk of crypto is serving defi and so its kind a circle jerk, it pretty much only serves the converted. and hasnt broken into widespread adoption (yet)

\- there are a whole bunch of payment services but they dont seem to have big traction, except in some 3rd world countries (which is growing, so that something) and the el salvador experiment is still going on but other countries are not flocking to the idea yet. and btc does undermine the feds until they create their own and back it. i have been thinking they will come out with with their digital currency and end up being the de facto stablecoin.

\- and nfts, gaming, metaverses are all spinning their wheels, i am hoping in the next cycle they will have breakthroughs that lead to widespread adoption.

\- the above is quite a lot but what else ? some projects like helium make me say ""now there is a  use case""  there are many interesting possibilities bubbling up.

1658254203,"for fuck sake, stop believing your own assumptions, you're arrogantly clueless and have zero understanding of any of this and no one should be making any decision based on this nonsense.

you and a ton of other people are handwaving away all the details as if none of them matter, then trying to connect what's left so you can make simplistic claims about fraud that don't apply.

&gt; they also stole our crypto and now want to give us back vgx.

they didn't ""steal"" your crypto, you handed it to them under a contractual agreement.

you can claim they failed to honor the agreement or violated some specific state or federal law, but you aren't doing that you're using examples that don't apply.

&gt;  when i give you money for apple stock and you decide to give me some worthless fake stock back, that's fraud. 

1) we aren't talking about stock, which has specific protections for situations like this. crypto doesn't.

2) you conveniently left out the fact they filed bankruptcy, so yes federal law does give them the right to provide something of lesser value if they don't have enough assets to return what you're owed. i doubt they'll be able to use vgx or even stock for that purpose, but they haven't actually done that yet so the scenario you claim is similar literally hasn't happened.

&gt; another example, i give money to an apple store for an iphone and that apple store decides it's actually a used tech store and gives you back an off brand nokia phone, that's fraud.

literally has nothing to do with this, your comparisons aren't going to convince anyone but yourself.

&gt; court's will also prove that voyager does not own our crypto - their tos will probably not hold up, especially if they claimed they were a brokerage from the start.

once again this is more complicated than you claim, and you have no idea what you're talking about.

in the u.s. they're probably right, crypto assets aren't cash/stocks, in a bankruptcy the actual crypto probably will be considered voyagers assets, and they'll owe you for the *value of those assets*. that's not ""fraud"".

even if voyager doesn't make that claim, the court might, and other creditors almost certainly would.

&gt; 
&gt; they shouldn't have accepted deposits in june when they knew they had no funds or crypto but they still scammed people and stole our money then froze the accounts.

this one isn't even true, ""no funds or crypto"" is not even remotely reflected by reality. you're making shit up and assuming it's fine because ""voyager is the bad guy"" so it doesn't matter.

&gt; they are being investigated by fdic for fraud - they had false advertising.

they seem to have already done that a long time ago, but that still has little to do with this case because insurance only covers things that are missing, and usd isn't missing. fdic never would have applied to crypto and voyager never claimed it did.

&gt; false marketing about customer's owning crypto. yes this is a crime in the financial world. you cannot write whatever you want in your tos and then market it differently to gain customers for your scheme - you are committing fraud.

once again not even remotely as simple as you think, you aren't even describing the situation accurately.

you did own the crypto, it was never locked up the way a lot of exchanges require you to do in order to receive interest or staking rewards, and you probably *still* do have an ownership right to it under u.s. law, but that doesn't mean there's a simple ""yes or no"" answer about who owns assets that have been rehypothecated, certainly not in a bankruptcy.",-2,,suddenlypandabear,0

**fraudulent activity by voyager:**

they claimed they were a brokerage and now in their filings they are not. not a good look legally when the sec finds out.

they also stole our crypto and now want to give us back vgx. when i give you money for apple stock and you decide to give me some worthless fake stock back, that's fraud. another example, i give money to an apple store for an iphone and that apple store decides it's actually a used tech store and gives you back an off brand nokia phone, that's fraud.

court's will also prove that voyager does not own our crypto - their tos will probably not hold up, especially if they claimed they were a brokerage from the start.

they shouldn't have accepted deposits in june when they knew they had no funds or crypto but they still scammed people and stole our money then froze the accounts.they are being investigated by fdic for fraud - they had false advertising.

false marketing about customer's owning crypto. yes this is a crime in the financial world. you cannot write whatever you want in your tos and then market it differently to gain customers for your scheme - you are committing fraud.

please do something before the whole lot of us get nothing. this is where we are headed, we need the masses!!!",7,,rwait901,0
1658261101,"i really hope that you are intentionally using misleading data, because you work for apple or can’t take your head out of tim cook’s ass.

i refuse to believe that anybody can be that stupid. i enjoy my apple products and i even own a decent amount of apple stock, but people like you who just repeat marketing propaganda from apple used to defend against anti competitive measures are really cultivating the image of mindless apple sheep.

first of all, citing the os market share for desktop and mobile apps is totally missing the point here.
if you own a smartphone in most parts of these worlds, you will likely use an ios and android device. if you own such a device, the app store and google play store will amount to 95% of the total revenue generated by mobile app stores. if you own an android device, the play store is by far the market leader and has a quasi monopolistic market share, but other app stores have emerged allow viable alternatives like f-droid.
if you own an iphone, you only have one choices and it’s apple. they are a monopolist in their ecosystem.
you also have to keep in mind that device market share can not be used to argue for the app store market share, because iphones are premium devices, while android devices are sold at a huge price range. people in third world countries who got an android for $50 are not in the market for a $5/month subscription, while someone who has paid $500-1500 for a iphone will likely spend more money on apps and subscription services 
this is the reason why the apple app store is the leading store regarding revenue and profits. your numbers are totally useless and i have no idea why you thought that this would be a good idea.

in the end i am really glad that more and more markets are establishing consumer protection laws and allow choice so that people like you who lack the brain capacity and knowledge to understand why it’s bad that the largest store front for mobile digital purchases doesn’t allow any competition, can still benefit when more intelligent people with push laws and regulations.

if people like you would have the power, we would use archaic bell “internet” on slow and ridiculously expensive ibm computers.",1,,mrloooongnose,0

this makes bankruptcy much less likely. i think he may be able to use the same method he used for chewy and gamestop to transform the e-commerce and delivery side of things while trimming the fat and focusing on delighting customers.

nothing in the current financials will show you what can be done under his guidance but you also might look to a few years back before covid because the last two years have been particularly hard on retail.

you might also consider the fact that after making billions on chewy, he mostly just bought apple stock and waited a long time to find a new project, which ended up being gamestop. now there is only one other position in his activist investor portfolio - rc ventures, and that’s bbby. at 1/3 the price of when he bought 10% of the company and a bunch of way otm jan call options, i’m buying as much as i possibly can right now.

&gt;they claimed they were a brokerage and now in their filings they are not.

are you truly that dense? the word "" brokerage"" is not exclusive and not exclusive to only a stock or commodity brokerage. they are a crypto brokerage, but they are not a stock brokerage, thus not a member of sipa thus they can't file sipa. this is just like fdic. only members of fdic are fdic insured because they pay insurance to be fdic insured. the bankruptcy form has only 2 options: stock broker or commodity. they are neither!!! there are auto brokerages, real estate brokerages and so on. you are totally off with this nonsense. not to mention, voyager does have a stock brokerage they purchased last year, but it is not a part of the bankruptcy nor it was even operational. 

&gt;they also stole our crypto and now want to give us back vgx. when i give you money for apple stock and you decide to give me some worthless fake stock back, that's fraud

lol no, you gave them your crypto to do what they need at your own risk. this is not a stock regulated market. but crypto. you keep copying this same bs which is nonsense and proves nothing.


&gt;courts will also prove that voyager does not own our crypto - their tos will probably not hold up, especially if they claimed they were a brokerage from the start. what they are saying is very messed up legally.

lol they are a crypto brokerage lmao the word brokerage is not exclusive. voyager is a broker meaning it facilitates trading through its routing technology. this means you won't be able to decide where to execute your trades, voyager does this for you.

&gt;they shouldn't have accepted deposits in the month of june when they knew they had no funds or crypto but they still scammed people and stole our money then froze the accounts. criminal

prove intentional fraud. you seems so confident in spewing this nonsense and shouting ""fraud and criminal"" so much, then why don't you get an attorney to sue them??

1658307017,"i'm not getting paid. if you can't handle squeeze stocks then don't trade them. i only trade squeeze stocks where people have plenty of time to get in, and plenty of time to get out. for example bbig, ater, etc. or even recently rdbx which ran from $2 to over $10... again, you had plenty of time to get in and plenty of time to get out. funny thing is a stock can go up over 500% and people will still happen to make it go red and then find someone to blame.

also, if you were actually in my discord and twitter, then you should've made bank on all of the non-squeeze stocks i gave. literally $oxy is up over 10% since my loading zone alert, $labu up over 10%, $soxl up over 10%, $clf nearly up over 10%, and many times where we played $sqqq and $tqqq for over 20% gain on commons and over 200-500% gain on options. also $tsla, $amd, $nvda, we all made gains on those and options multi-bagged. played both $kold and $boil too for over 30% gain... lol... the list of winners go on. and again, you had plenty of time to get in, and plenty of time to get out.

lastly, if you can't handle squeeze stocks then don't trade them. i give many plays that are non-squeeze stocks, and to be factual i've given more non-squeeze setups than non-squeeze for the past 3 months. additionally, i already wrote multiple risk management guides on both twitter and discord, and people still manage to make a winning trade go red.

and if you were in my private twitter and discord, sorry to see you go. if you had a bad experience then i apologize. there was plenty of opportunities to make money. i am profitable in both bull and bear markets and my followers know that. doesn't matter what stock i trade too, small cap or large cap, etfs, etc, the track record is there. there is no point in spreading false fud like this when most people have banked on my ideas. this is why i avoid drama, we are only here to make money. many people were upset that i made profit on $tsla because they said it was ""too overpriced or whatever"" and they unfollowed me because they were short and i was long, and i ended up being right. it's drama like that i don't give a fuck about, i'm only here to make money so yes i will purge the idiots that will blame a winning trade on me. i keep discussion to stocks only now, none of this drama stuff because there's no point. anyways, have a good day",0,,caddude42069,0

1658314836,"well can you exchange your shit for goods and services? because you can with bitcoin, even if those goods and services are questionable/limited. people accepting it as a currency that can be used is also what gives it value, same thing that gives the us dollar value. more generally, it is the demand that gives it value. there is demand because it can be used as a currency and because it is rare, and quite simply, because people *want it*. 

for example, i've met quite a few people who genuinely believe in its future potential, and to them it is a matter of when, not if, it becomes part of our lives. for those people, it has value because they see themselves as getting in early, like being able to buy apple stock from the 80s. 

to these people, they aren't buying now so the price will go up so they can sell. they are buying now because they see the current price as the cheapest it's ever going to be to acquire this new kind of asset. so actually they buy it just to hold onto for the future.

now you can disagree with those people all you like (i do too), but all of these reasons create demand. so if you can find an amazing marketer to make everyone *want* your shit, yeah you could probably sell it. people buy female influencers fucking bath water for christs sake.",1,,aMAYESingNATHAN,0

1658317867,"your perspective is molded by the enthusiasts that comment on this subreddit and on other places, which are a tiny minority of actual pc gamers. the steam hardware survey provides real, verifiable numbers that show this is not the case. for simplicities sake, i'll be using launch msrp numbers for everything and ignoring other circumstances (like performance per dollar and length of time between launches, which determines how popular gpu generations are) until the end. 

the latest one ([june 2022](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/)) shows the rtx 3080 ($700) at 1.44%, 3080 ti ($1200) at 0.67%, and rtx 3090 ($1500) at 0.46%. this is about 2-4 months before rtx 40-series is expected to launch. 

now looking the the [june 2020 survey](https://web.archive.org/web/20200731145030/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/), show the rtx 2080 ($700-$800) at 0.98% and 2080 ti ($1000-$1200) at 0.89%. this is about 3 months before rtx 30-series launched. 

here's the [june 2018 survey](https://web.archive.org/web/20180618082516/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/), which shows the gtx 1080 ($700) at 2.43% and gtx 1080 ti ($700) at 1.27%. the titan variants of this generation are under 0.3% and as such do not show up in the survey as individual models. however, it's heavily worth noting that there's several reasons why their market share is so low. number one, the only variant was the nvidia stock blower cooler which performed incredibly poorly and was only sold direct through nvidia and never went on sale. number two, the gtx 1080 ti was essentially identical to the titan and launched only 7 months afterwards. number three, the titan x (pascal) was replaced by the titan xp 8 months after launch, splitting market share between the two. the rtx 2080 ti and 3090 that replaced the titan in the lineup (as the titans were moved to being true workstation gpus rather than a gaming gpu in disguise with the launch of the titan v) had none of the above limitations. june 2018 was 3 months before the launch of the rtx 20-series. 

lastly, here's the [february 2016 survey](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401121050/http://store.steampowered.com:80/hwsurvey/videocard). the gtx 980 ($550) is 0.98% and the gtx 980 ti ($650) is 0.75%. no titan x again, for the same reasons as above. i've included both the 980 and 980 ti because very conveniently, $700 today is about $550 in 2016. also chose february this time around because it's 3 months ahead of the gtx 10-series launch. 

quickly looking at each of them, they all make perfect sense. the adoption of high end gtx 900-series cards was relatively low because that was still during a time when new gpus popped out every year. the adoption of high end gtx 10-series was relatively high due to the much longer gap (2.5 years) between it and the rtx 20-series, in addition to it being very impressive over the gtx 900-series it replaced. the adoption of rtx 20-series was low because they were absolute garbage values and were terrible in comparison to gtx 10-series, but the long length of time (2 years) between it and the rtx 30-series propped it up. adoption of rtx 30-series has been relatively high because (ignoring the shortages) they're absolutely incredible values compared to the rtx 20-series and is the first time in nearly 5 years we've seen a good generational update, so people hanging onto 10-series and older wanted to upgrade this time around, in addition to the fact it's another two year cycle and launched in the middle of covid when everyone was stuck at home and wanted new gaming pcs. 

in addition, prices will continue to rise due to inflation, increased competition between companies (forcing nvidia/amd/maybe intel to increase die sizes in lieu of major performance breakthroughs, which means higher prices), and the reality that the gpu shortage showed them they can increase their margins and people will still buy them so long as they aren't heavily undercut by others (but why do that when you can collude unintentionally or not to pad those margins). the first two have been driving prices up for a while. i will also point out that even as far back as 2008, there were gpus in the $600+ range, namely the gtx 280 launched at $650, which is now $900.

1658334636,"the joint stock company is, arguably, the technology responsible for what we consider the 'western world' to dominate global politics since the industrial revolution. it allowed the english to send expeditions to *the new world* without the risk of bankrupting a single very rich person, instead it spread the risk out to a bunch of people. if you are a rich guy and you invest in 10 expeditions, you will gain more than you lose. if you are sole investor in one expedition and it fails, you are totally wiped out. modern insurance practices are rooted in this business as well but that is a different discussion. 

it is literally not a ponzi scheme because you aren't using new investor money to pay old investors. if you do a stock offering, you are doing it to invest in some new capital thingamagig you need to be a successful company. 

when you *go public* you allow people with no connection to the company to buy shares, whereas a private company will selectively sell shares to vetted investors. you go public to raise a lot of capital to get you off the ground. tesla would not exist if not for the constant buoying from its investors, the payoff is that investors *got paid*. the risk is you lose money, but like our rich guys sending expeditions to the new world, the point is you invest in tesla, ford, hyundai, etc and bet that 2/3rds of those investments pay off.  

stock dividends are payouts to stockholders who own shares, that is the closest thing you will get to a ponzi scheme. if you invest in ford, you don't expect them to rocket to the moon like tesla, you might make a dollar or two per share but you aren't going to go from middle class to loaded like if you took the risk on tesla and sold high. to keep you interested (i.e. keep you invested instead of withdrawing your money) they will pay you a small percentage of the share price every quarter, like a credit card collecting interest. 

the *stock market* is literally that, a place where you can buy and sell stocks easily. one of those is the nasdaq exchange, i might go there to buy microsoft stock. i access the nasdaq through a brokerage. i don't need to, if i know my neighbor owns microsoft stock they could give them to me, it is all legal. the brokerages and markets are there to help normal people get into the 'game' as it were.",2,,Leucippus1,0

that said, congressional trading on non-public information is just as illegal as naked short selling and all of the other stuff that happens on the stock market daily, and it's just as punitively toothless as all of it.

time travel is fun to think about because there are so many avenues and variables. but i have thought through the ""going back in my life with all my present knowledge"" i know of a couple events that would make me quite wealthy (like buy apple stock in 2000). so all it amounts to really is sort of ""at some point in my past what would've happened if i won the lottery"" and i suppose getting that girl i had a crush on in highschool, but mostly it just spawns a bunch of new questions.

i got divorced, i spent 15 years with my ex wife, but it's been seven years and with time and clarity, i can see we weren't a good match. if i could go back, i wouldn't chose to pursue that relationship again.

1658424157,"this is not financial advice:
1. if you earn a salary and pay taxes in sweden you are paying a higher rate than in the us. if you file your taxes and claim the foreign tax exclusion, you get no benefit. if you file the foreign tax credit, the amount you “overpaid” becomes a credit. (steep 1)
2. isk accounts are the best low tax option in sweden (not counting insurance type isks ). if you follow step 1 you accumulate 10-20k usd in credits each year (more if filing jointly) that can be accumulated and combined for up to 10 years. the profit you earn in the isk can used up your credits. for example, you paid 20k in taxes, but only owed 10k in us taxes, so you have a 10k credit in the us. now you invest in apple stock and make 5k in capital gains this year in an isk. when you report your gains for taxation in the us, you owe full tax on the 5k (say 1.5k) but you have a 10k credit, so you pay no tax.
3. roth is, indeed the best. keep in mind if filing the foreign tax credit, or for some other reason, you must file joint (if married) or no roth for you this year. there is something you missed on the roth. yes, you face double taxation, when you take the money out- sweden will tax you. however, if you establish residency for the tax year, outside sweden (assuming you are swedish citizens by then) you do not get taxed on earnings outside sweden. you could potentially move back to the us for 1 year and then withdraw the full roth.
there is something you did not mention, if it becomes an issue. i have found you get so much more financial options in the us. for example, the isks i have seen do not allow you to buy leveraged etfs (e.g. 3x spy, etc), and some us or international stocks can’t be bought in it. i haven’t looked at crypto either. also, i have not found a way to issue covered calls (options contracts), which can be a very very nice way to earn an extra 3-10% per year, even with low risk. meanwhile a roth with options trading enabled has so many more ways to earn and compound your savings. also, any losses in an isk are not deductible from swedish taxes.",4,,1011010110001010,0

1658437102,i have had more success trading options trading them based on the price of the underlying the option is on.  verses trying to have a stop as a percentage of the option price.  for example if you trading aapl long with a call option with aapl 50 cents over the 200/sma- your stop loss could be when aapl falls below the 200sma.  aapl stock does not care what the price of the option is at that moment- volatility and theta could also have an affect.  so you may need to make adjustments.,3,,daytradingguy,0

**radiante**

bare with me as this is basically a rough draft and isn’t concrete as of yet. it’s just ideas i’ve been typing down until i get a solid grasp of what i really want this story to be. 

• **high voltage** : (protagonist) **radiante** 
18 year old down on his luck with the ability to manipulate electromagnetism. he can manipulate and generate electricity as well as having super strength, speed, agility, durability, electro senses, enhanced senses, healing/regeneration, levitation, and electro teleportation. he’s a vigilante that hunts down and captures monstrous beings called “blights” that run rampant around the world. while he’s intelligent and courageous, he can often be naive to borderline ignorant and stubborn when it comes to working with other heroes or even his own decisions. one major downfall of his is his indecisive and hesitation that catches up to him and hurts his loved ones in the process. he’s often in conflict with balancing his normal life and his superhero alter ego. often even being in conflict with his own morality as well as he’s unsure if he’s doing the right thing. 

• **knightwalker** : **radiante** 
co-leader of the **v.n.g.r.d.** : vindicate neutralize gather reclaim destroy (they’re a corporation that deals with blights). goes by the book (at least his anyway). knightwalker has the ability to manipulate shadows and darkness. he can be intangible, has super strength, speed, durability, agility, dark constructs, healing/regeneration, and use dark energy as concussive force. he’s also extremely skilled in martial arts and acrobatics. not to mention he’s one of the worlds best detectives (yes, he’s very much inspired by batman). as much as he addresses himself as dark and brooding, he’s very much a gentle hero who despises violence and killing blights. 

• **heatwave** : **radiante** 
part of the **v.n.g.r.d.** , heatwave is an incredibly chill and nonchalant hero with little to no temper whatsoever. he often comes into conflict with knightshade for not taking things seriously when things get dire. despite his easygoing personality, his power is extremely dangerous. heatwave can manipulate fire and solar radiation, and by synthesizing solar radiation he’s capable of flight, super strength, speed, agility, durability, and super senses. 

• **echo** : **radiante**
a villain turned hero, echo tries her best to be apart of the **v.n.g.r.d.** to redeem her transgressions and help get rid of the blights that run rampant around the world. echo can copy any **radiantes** (names of supers in this story) abilities and keep them. however the abilities she copies aren’t as powerful as the original she copies them from, as per her name, she gains the “echo” of their power. because she can copy many powers at a time, she can and has been viewed as exponentially dangerous. 

• **stargazer** : (antagonist) **radiante**
co-leader of the **v.n.g.r.d.** stargazer has an incredibly goofy yet charismatic personality that meshes really well with his ability to manipulate light. he can make light hard constructs, light concussive blasts, light sensory, invisibility, super strength, ftl speed, agility, durability, and healing/regeneration. stargazer however, as nice as he seems to be, is conniving, ingenious, and borderline sociopathic. he does an incredibly good job at keeping his facade without giving off a slight hint of malice. he believes that the only way to rid of the world of the blights is to take full control of **v.n.g.r.d.** with an iron fist as he believes that it’s the only way to save the world from the blights 

• **aperture** : the second successful **mod** (they’re super powered people that gained their powers with man made scientific experimentation to combat radiantes and blights made by **a.e.s.i.r.** : advanced and enhanced security for individuals with resistance) has the power to teleport. she can also open up portals to any place she wants as long as she has been to or has seen before, this however takes a lot of energy out of her and puts her out of commission for a couple of minutes. at some point, while exerting her power in a pinch, she was able to teleport to a different point in time. she has only been able to do this once however and is unsure if she’s capable of doing it again. because she’s a mod she comes with the basic superhuman abilities such as super strength, speed, durability, and agility, although it’s not to the same level as typical radiantes. 

• **all heart** : the original **mod** that had been frozen due to the potential danger he posed to the **a.e.s.i.r.** when they were first established as he didn’t agree to the their methods and beliefs. he’s essentially this universes superman with captain americas ideals of a better world. as of now he remains frozen.",1,,HighVoltage_520,0

as for the bill's progress through the congress, you can track each bill at the following links:

[senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3309?r=1&amp;s=1)

[house](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3309?r=1&amp;s=1)

now, this is where all of the positive feedback caused me to do a little bit more research. turns out **the bill hasn't become a law yet!** as you can see, the senate passed it, but the house still hasn't taken it up yet!. which means not only is the purchase of nvidia stock not as 'sure' of a bet as you'd be led to think but if this is insider trading, why wouldn't he have timed it to coincide with the bill progressing through the house (ya know the side of the building his wife controls) instead of the senate? also, if this is directly to legislation, why buy nvidia stock rather than one of the main beneficiaries of the legislation? nvidia relies on other companies to make their chips, why not but intel stock? could it be that nvidia is a local company to his wife's district and as a wealthy individual married to a politician, he would have an interest in supporting his 'local business'? or is it all a carefully planned smoke screen for [someone worth $100+ million dollars](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=n00007360&amp;year=2018) to make a couple of percentage points of profit off of a relatively modest investment?",0,,Send-More-Coffee,0

9/1 opens at $137.59 and marks the beginning of a one day climb then descent. aapl closes that day at $134.18, opens at $137.59 on 8/2 then falls to $112.82 by 9/8 and $107-$112 by 9/23.   
  

after that, there's a slow, steady climb up to a high of $125 by 10/12 and back down to 108 close by november followed by a slow, jagged clime up to $136.69 by 12/28 around christmas, second slightly later in january (high 145), back down to $125 in feb/march 2021, then a slow climb up with a bump in april 2021 ($130-ish), leading to its modern-day price of $141.50.     

1 share bought on the 17th before the split and sold immediately post split would be an increase in both share price and share amount, about 4.40x your money.   

if you then rebought in along the way at a non-bottom amount, say, $114 and held for 1 year, it would *also* be an increase from $114-&gt; $153 or so again, for about 1.34x your money (at long term gains, hence the year example)   

this was *not* a heavily shorted stock. (for that, we look at tsla) this makes sense: insiders cashed out their extra shares after the dividend and maybe bought back in after. this is a *traditional* 'company grew, time to be rewarded and cash out'.

9/1 sees the beginning of a fall to  $330 on 9/8, a recovering to 442 by the 18th, then a stretch out to november through january where it really shoots 	up.around $850 all through january all the way to the current price of $815 today with the absolutely lowest price since the bottlerocket being 650.   

one share bought before the split record date would cost around  $374. if you dumped as soon as possible  on the market open, five shares would be sold at $444-$500 *each*.   

this brings you roughly in the ballpark of 5.93xing your money! you could also buy back in a week later around $350-$360.   

if you had held instead until december, tslaclosed $645 the day before christmas day (23rd) and by january 06 it was $750 each share.   

so yes, the price being split in four is fud.
probably.

we'll see in about a week, month, and/or five minutes depending on your timescale!",7,,Udoshi,0

1658499263,"first - pty is not a typical fixed income investment - it is a closed-end fund and makes extensive use of leverage to boost its results.  the specific analysis you performed utilized that fund at what was most likely the best time in history to have utilized that fund - and that skews the results in its favor by a huge margin.  qe drove bond yields into the dirt way down increasing the value of existing bond holdings.  most bond funds make distributions based on the yield of the underlying holdings - i.e if the bonds in the fund generate 3% in interest, the fund distributes the 3% as your yield.  pty is not constrained that way - they can make any distribution they want to - that is why their yield numbers look so strong in certain cases - they distributed the paltry yield on the underlying holdings, but also some of the massive increase in principal value.   they also managed to boost the impact of the increase in the value of the bonds by using leverage - they borrowed a lot of the the bonds/preferred stocks rather than buying them, so for every dollar that went to bond ""purchases"" they bought 2x-3x the number of bonds they could have bought for the same dollar had they paid outright.  so when these bonds skyrocketed in value, they got 2x-3x the value increase they would have had they just bought them.  those return numbers in the early years are incredible.

now look at this year.  the reverse is happening - yields are running hot and bond values are on pace to have their worst year ever.  that fund is down 30% while the bond agg is down around 10%.

your analysis is also impacted by sequence-of-return risk.  taking the 30% hit in the stock portfolio in the second year killed any chance it had of sustaining itself with your withdrawal rate.

the real issue i see in your analysis is the withdrawal rate itself $96k/year from a $1mm portfolio is not sustainable.  sure, in hindsight on the market you can find something like pty that just happened to work out well in that particular market, but you can say the same thing about just putting all the money in apple stock or btc as the right time too.

my starting point - and there are other factors to consider, but my starting point is to look at the average income needs over the next decade (or first decade of retirement if you have not started yet) and then see what you can generate in fixed income.  if, for example, you really need an average of 96k over the first year - it would take around 2.2mm, earning around 4.5% in yield (about what you can get right now in a good basket of bonds and preferred stocks), just to produce that income.  that is the least amount i would start with trying to meet that need, and even then, i'd be concerned about the long term at that level.

\*\*\*all of this is off the cuff based on about 10 minutes looking at your analysis and my own experience of evaluating retirement scenarios and various investment options.  there are gross generalization on the specifics of pty that most likely do not match the actual operations of that fund - i have nothing against closed-end funds in general, but wanted to emphasize that they come with additional risks that are difficult to quantify.",1,,vaderaintmydaddy,0

1658524466,"the discounted stock argument works better on proven and true companies. when apple stock declines you buy because it's safer.

we're talking about a growth stock (essentially a penny if not for reverse split) here, where the future is unknown. believing is one thing, but thinking you are keep buying at a discount all the way down is not investing. this is pretty much a sunk cost trap. 

people having bought at $8, $5, $3 and now prob thought they were getting a discount. had you taken emotion out and waited for stability you would have probably saved yourselves from further losses.",6,,mbibs365,0
1658527580,"and those people were still in profit. it doesnt matter if you dont sell perfectly at the peak as long as youre in profit. but to buy at an all time high is absolutely absurd behaviour. property is the same as any other investment.

would you buy silver at an all time high ? bitcoin ? apple stock ? no, of course not. so why would someone buy a house at all time highs. its the same principal. 

now is the time the intelligent and the rich are selling and the poor dummys are buying and getting into generational debt.

1658533648,"it's good that you aren't day trading, though i didn't assume that ;-)!

it's also good that you aren't trying to time the market, there's a common saying, ""time in the market, beats timing the market""!

to be fair, what i'm talking about is more of a quibble.  i believe that most people on this sub will agree that passive investing in index funds will beat picking individual stocks, even if you use a ""buy and hold""  strategy.  but you will find some that disagree.  what you are doing isn't anything terrible, it's more of an optimization question.

if you really want to know why, it gets a bit involved, though there's nothing really ""technical"" about it, though it does involve some concepts of optimization.

basically, as with many things, investing involves balancing reward (what is the expected average profit / return) versus risk (what is the probability that your actual profit will be close to the average).  ideally, you'd prefer to have the highest possible reward at the lowest risk, but unfortunately risk and reward are somewhat inversely related.

for example, in  a single growth stock has a very high potential return.  imagine investing all your money in apple 25 years ago!  on the other hand the risk is very high at a low point, apple only survived because microsoft infused them with a bunch of capital - [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/051115/7-bankrupt-companies-came-back.asp#:\~:text=while%20never%20actually%20filing%20for,investment%20and%20saved%20the%20company](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/051115/7-bankrupt-companies-came-back.asp#:~:text=while%20never%20actually%20filing%20for,investment%20and%20saved%20the%20company).  apple stock easily could have become worthless.  

the best strategy to maximize return while minimizing risk is to ""diversify"", i.e. spread your investment over many stocks.  the minimum number of stocks to adequately diversify isn't set in stone, but most sources would say 20-30 is enough ([https://money.com/diversification-how-many-stocks/](https://money.com/diversification-how-many-stocks/) ).  but it isn't quite that simple, because if those stocks are all related (say, all tech stocks or all banks stocks) then you really aren't diversified, because that stocks will often go up or down together.  you want stocks that will counterbalance each other, in a kind of hedge.

all of this gets kind of complex and judging how diversified your investments are while at the same time trying to pick good stocks to invest in can be taxing and time consuming.  you know the easiest way to be highly diversified?  buy a bit of everything!  and you know the easiest way to do that!  buy an index fund!  easy peasy!  \*and\* other people will manage those funds for you, and they'll do it very cheaply because there's no judgement or expertise involved, so your management fees are low.

and \*that's\* why passive investing is popular and successful! ;-)",2,,RNG_HatesMe,0

1658567938,"so some things to look up are what a bear market is and what a bull market is. right now the markets, stocks and crypto, are both fairly bearish. bitcoin was 68k around december 2021 for example, but it seems like it could enter a bull market at any moment. look at graphs and see the trends of stocks and cryptos. do your research and subscribe to podcasts for cryptos/stocks if that's what you want to do, or what i do is talk in the cryptocurrency discord. you can meet me in #crypto-trading in the one i use: https://discord.gg/cryptocurrencyofficial. you can look at multiple youtube videos to gather information. when you talk in our discord people will talk about relevant news and link videos and news articles, so it's a great community to join. cryptos/stocks follow the news, so you start to understand how the markets work. the crypto matic for example announced recently that it's carbon neutral, its price then skyrocketed. now we see that matic is partnered with meta, disney and so many other companies. i would say that cryptos and stocks are becoming intertwined. if you're buying meta stock, you may as well also purchase matic. it's all a part of the ecosystem. if you want to know more just ask.",2,,BinaryDigit_,0

interesting play! do you believe $meta’s headwinds are temporary and that there will be plenty of growth due to the metaverse or that they can grow with ad revenue and occulus? i’ve been looking at telecoms given the fact people will always need them. $vz has looked interesting since i’m hoping their capital expenditure will die down with 5g investments, but i haven’t kept up with $t. hope it plays out for you!",2,,jhilldooder,0

1658627504,"as mentioned previously, they need to change their revenue flow.

facebook failed to do so, and now we have seen the aftermath. their business model and revenue was pretty much solely based on advertising revenue, and now that it has become the target of legislators (and apple) it has decimated their stock. now they are scrambling to make the metaverse work. what they should have done is seen all of this coming and then start the metaverse work ahead of time so that when the legislators (and apple) decide to clamp down, they have already protected themselves as they have shifted their business model from advertising to the metaverse.

google needs to do the same thing, in my opinion it will be a switch from the advertising revenue to gcp. right now, google needs to seriously work hard to make gcp function. they need to obtain a good amount of market share and make gcp profitable and a good, large source of revenue.

once they do that, i am going to town on googl stock. for now, i am keeping a modest position.

i think that is a wise analysis of it, please let me know your thoughts.

edit: i have just realised your comment was about apple, not google. you are correct, but apple is protected in the sense that they have not built their business model to be completely reliant on those commissions and app store income. yes, it is a business with a really good profit margin, but it doesn’t produce as much revenue as their devices do. therefore, apple’s revenue flow is mostly protected. yes, the removal of the google commissions and app store income will injure them, but not to the extent that meta faced, or google will face if they continue to rely on advertising income as their number one revenue generator.",1,,maximalsimplicity,0

**brief bear case for $meta (tl;dr)**: 

after er misses from $snap &amp; $twtr, falling fb &amp; ig app store metrics, and continued dominance from tiktok, $meta puts into earnings look like a reasonable trade. however, with an iv rank of 94% (iv has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. if you don’t have time to read, that means i’m arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring july 29th ahead of $meta’s earnings.

**first, some facts:**

* $meta carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.
* february 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% — the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02b.
* $meta shares recently reached a fresh &gt;2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.
* prior to that, $meta reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20. 
   * how brief? the week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $meta closed at $154.34 — $0.09 above its most recent june low. 
   * the week following (beginning 3/23/20) $meta closed at $156.79 — $2.54 above its most recent low.
   * outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $meta has respected the $154 level since early 2019.
* since reporting earnings in february of 2022, shares of $meta have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758. 
* despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in april of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.
* the bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $meta’s pandemic low of $137.10.
* tiktok continues to dominate facebook, instagram and messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.
   * on a list of the top grossing apps in the us, tiktok places 3rd, facebook places 84th. instagram and messenger are too low to feature.
* lastly, zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of meta. 
   * [meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)
      * ceo mark zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.

&gt;""if i had to bet, i'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,"" zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee q&amp;a session, audio of which was heard by reuters.

**conclusion**: bearish

in the wake of $snap and $twtr missing earnings on the top and bottom line, tiktok’s continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $meta shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $meta’s earnings this thursday. however, with a 94% iv rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and iv crush to contend with, it’s critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.

**the trade structure**: put debit spreads

**safe**: targeting the $155 support level. 

**lotto**: target the $137 support level if $meta breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it’s downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.

for july 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** — risking $6.00 for a profit of $9.00, breakeven of $164 and maximum value of $15.00 if $meta satisfies its 10.5% expected move. 

**or** 

for july 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** — risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $meta has another outsized earnings move like it did in february, targeted at the next area of support.

**alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts — risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $meta falls to it’s pandemic low. 

no matter which trade you pick, it’s important to collect at least *some* premium on this. holding through earnings is risky business, iv crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, otm options, which is why we want to target the atm $170 strike for our long position. 

**trade headwinds**: 

* $meta’s earnings report falls on july 27th, after market close — directly in between the fomc’s next rate hike meeting (july 26th) and directly before we get qoq gdp data (july 28th, 8:30 am est). that means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $meta earnings and gdp data. if the gdp reaction is bad, that’s a big tailwind. if the gdp reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can’t afford from a time basis.
* alphabet ($googl) and microsoft ($msft) earnings reports are due on july 26th — right before $meta. a positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.

despite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $meta ahead of earnings. 

**the wrap up**

use $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $meta’s earnings to target the current &gt;2 year low and an average move of 10.5% — or — target the $137 pandemic low if you’re looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).

her husband also exercised  options to purchase 25,000 microsoft shares which were worth another $5 million in march of last year.  how convenient that this was just a couple of weeks before the army announced a $22 billion contract to buy equipment ( vr headsets/aug reality etc)  from microsoft.  surprisingly, microsoft stock price increased...

there's no ""conspiracy"" here.  just corruption and insider trading by crooked politicians who should have been removed from power a long long time ago.  pelosi and her husband aren't the only guilty ones.  there are guilty people on both sides of the aisle.  she's just the current one in the discussion.  there is a well documented and proven pattern.  facts, not conspiracy theory.  although yes, i do enjoy the entertainment value that those bring.

the trades are public so you can do your own dd if you wanted.  not saying you should, as it's just a waste of time in this case lol.  of course we find out after they've been completed of course.

1658663239,"depending on the gamemode, it might be quicker or slower. use $gamemode to check. in gamemode 1, you get 10 rolls an hour. in gamemode 2, you get 8, but with a more limited pool that technically should allow you to get higher ranked characters. in gamemode 2, use $limroul 1 1 1 1 to optimize to pool, and don't use a disablelist. in gamemode 1, do your best to make a good $disablelist (you can $antidisable some series too) so you can have better rolls.

the best way to get characters is, as the other person said, roll every hour. and make a $wishlist. to that, add building up your badges in $kakera (ruby 4 makes them cheaper, and $sapphire each gives you one extra roll an hour, while 4 makes all your bad kakera into yellow. everyone has their preference and will go mostly for ruby 4 first, but i go for sapphire 4). $kakerarewards for more info, and start building up your badges with a strategy in mind.

also, once you have your badges, you can start with the $kakeratower (and then $info kakeraloots)

basically these will give you better kakera quality, more kakera reaction power, and more rolls which lead to better card drops, because more rolls=more chance.

one more thing i'd say is worth mentioning is the tag you use to roll. like $wa $ha $ma $wg $hg $mg $w $h $m. you'll want to stick to one if you want a more limited pool as well. if you want both guys and girls, and from both game and anime you'll be forced to roll $m. which is not bad, but while you roll literally everything with $m, someone else might roll $wa non stop, which limits their rolls to anime only waifus and they might get higher level characters faster (anime only waifus make up for a good part of the top characters).

i don't know what you'd want to know more about, maybe i only wrote things you know about (hopefully it's not confusing), but i hope there's at least one helpful thing here.",9,,flyfreedude,0

1658676359,"fiat currency is exchanged for goods and services. it's usually backed up by a country's government, courts, police and military. (the last 2 are obviously rarely involved but eg. if you do repeatedly refuse to pay taxes and ignore all legal warnings, eventually government armed men will come to enforce.)

crypto theoretically has this and other uses but in reality is mainly used as a get rich quick scheme/investment by buying it  for fiat, hoping the line goes up and then cashing in for more fiat to exchange for goods and services.

unlike stocks where the value is correlated with a business performance and generating profits from delivering products and services, the value of a crypto is based on other people buying it and believing it's valuable.

this means as soon as that perception changes or big holders  start selling a lot, the value can drop even to 0 and  the investors still holding the bag get screwed. it's like a game of chicken with winners and losers. if you compare to eg. the value of apple stock, the value will go up and down based on how well they do selling their computers and phones. these sales also generate a ton of cash from customers so the value is based on real profits. this is very different from if the value came only from other people buying apple stock and believing one day it might do something.",1,,fedaykin909,0

1658682832,"&gt;if there was about to be $15 billion worth of used apartments hitting the market

your last comment and this entire thread is about the price of new gpus. nobody is talking about selling used gpus for $750, so the comparison to used apartments is moot. if you're in the small minority of people who wants to buy used, then have at it, but it's clearly not keeping people from buying new cards at the price you're complaining about. 

&gt;but the gpu mining market ends on september 19th, so i'd say we're in for a huge gpu price drop

many people ditched ethereum mining months ago when the price started to crash. they're not all just waiting for the last day before the merge to stop mining, and those that are will likely just mine something else. ethereum miners only make up a fraction of all crypto miners and crypto miners make up a small fraction of gpu owners.

&gt;nvidia stock already dropped 4% on friday

and yet they're still up 6% over the past week.

1658690673,"i think that's optimistic and you're going to see a lot more volatility than you're imagining. 

bear in mind, we've seen intraday swings of 5% sometimes in this market.


one of the problems is that everyone has blinders on, thinking that the fed decision is all that matters. so much more is going on.

things to consider:


* btc could pop or drop at any moment which would rock the market.


* evergrand releases its plan to mitigate the disaster it has made in china this week. huge catalyst.


* geopolitical wildcards are in play. putin agreed he'd allow ukranian grain safe passage from the county. then he launched missiles at ports. china is making threats to the u.s. over taiwan. pakistan is on the brink of a big mess. sri lanka just collapsed. italy just dissolved it's government. the u.k. just ousted their prime minister and they don't have a replacement.


* other key earnings come out early this week tuesday/wednesday in particular from big companies. if $msft or $googl post any bad projections, for example, the market will quake.


* lots of big u.s. economic data comes out starting tuesday. any of those numbers print a surprise and it will cause problems. in particular, if housing shows weakness/strength it will shock the market.


* the key number this week isn't the fed. it's the gdp estimate that comes out on thurs. if it is a negative, we are confirmed to be in a recession. the nber may not declare it (if they opt to spin it that way), but the market knows that two consecutive quarters of negative gdp means we are in a recession. this would be a game changer for everyone.


* the idea that the fed will slow down just doesn't have any credibility. 75 is the minimum, 100 more likely and 50 is impossible (in my opinion). there is a lot of optimism and there is a lot of selling retail investors on this idea of the fed softening to shake out dumb money that's in the market. they have barely begun to raise rates in comparison to inflation. the fed has exactly two mandates: 1) get inflation at a steady 2% 2) achieve a healthy labor market. inflation went up, not down, every quarter this year. 9.1% to 2% isn't going to happen with a moderate approach.  unemployment went down, not up, after their last rate hike. powell has no grounds to slow/stop raising rates. he can't do it. he has no way to justify it. he has also said, several times, that the labor market is too tight (and then it got tighter) and that house prices are coming down (which they haven't yet). 


* before the last fomc meeting, the rate hike news was leaked to the press well before the meeting/rate hike took place. powell likes soft selling things before it has to announce them. it makes him look less bad. he may attempt something like this again - especially if he will raise 100 basis points.


* bond auctions continue to shock the market each week - whether they show good news or bad. bond yields have been dropping overall and bond funds have been gaining value. that's not a good sign.",2,,stockpreacher,0

yes, but also keep an eye on tether - if that de-pegs, there will be fireworks.

&gt; geopolitical wildcards are in play

i think the market doesn't care about any of that, unless something truly new comes up.

&gt; if $msft or $googl post any bad projections

msft is mostly corporate customers, which probably hasn't slowed that much. googl could be a big deal, but i'm really looking at aapl as the one that will guide the market.

&gt; the key number this week isn't the fed. it's the gdp estimate that comes out on thurs

everyone has been talking recession for a couple of months - i don't think the market cares anymore. and anyway, the market will just look past the recession and go up because they think it will be over soon.

&gt; the idea that the fed will slow down just doesn't have any credibility

maybe, but i have no faith that the fed will do the right thing and actually get inflation under control by raising rates enough to do anything meaningful about inflation.

&gt; before the last fomc meeting, the rate hike news was leaked to the press

that's a good point. if they do 100 this time (i don't think they will), then i could see them leaking. if they don't, then it's 75 or 50. (which is insane, it should be 700 if they were serious about inflation).

if i sold you btc 2011 you can only make profit by finding a greater fool. eventually the chain leads to people having to hold useless things that don't generate any income or they lose money. if i sold you apple in 1999 i made a profit but you've also made a profit because apple has grown insanely big as a company since then. i sold you a whole other company basically and we both made a profit. the price determination is only similar to crypto in the short term, long term the fundamentals and decisions behind the company affect growth. if i sold you pets.com stock 1999 you've lost out big but that's because you bought an overvalued company that couldn't live up to its promises. but that's a side effect of stock market speculation while it's the only thing crypto speculation has. bitcoin will never generate a positive cash flow for you, microsoft will. if everybody dumped their microsoft stock tomorrow for pennies (unless microsoft turned out to be a fraud with trillions in debt) you would be a fool not to buy up a multi billion dollar company and decide what to do with it, earn all of its profit etc.",2,,Jankylad,0

if microsoft started making 500% their revenue all of a sudden they would go from 168b revenue to 840b revenue. even if the price doesn't change they can start paying out big to the current holders which would make them earn all that money they spent on the stock back in a few years at most. that cannot happen in crypto, there are no fundamentals backing it, no business, no revenue. it's just a greater fool theory. stock market is not even if short term swings and speculation can make it seem similar with shitty companies propped by speculation. but that only seems similar if you don't understand the obvious differences between stocks and crypto.

1658762732,"&gt; what’s with the unnecessary links? 

it's for readers who are unfamiliar with the terms &amp; concepts that i use.

if you live in the us you would never worry about a strengthening $.

if you arent's a macos nerd you'd not be aware on the difference on software updates &amp; security updates and their respective years of support.

unless you're heavily into your car's maintenance cycle you wouldn't understand the concept of preventive maintenance to avoid catastrophic failures.

&gt; anyway, people have different and changing needs. you’re looking at it from a pure capital asset perspective, in the same way an accountant would view a warehouse on a company’s books.

i agree but in the 1990s accounting would often depreciate computer equipment over 3 years.

apple pegs it a 4 years

intel ceo is at 5-6 years

change of physical design is 9 years or less

10 years for macos/windows support

then there's replacing when you have credit card points or a paid gig that covers the cost of equipment.

so much reasons to replace but mine pushes on the end of os support &amp; valuing your time and data's worth.

&gt; i also like new things sometimes.

everyone likes new things except my friend who was born in 1979 who is a tech luddite and yet born in 1950 mom has the latest iphone with faceid enabled.

i speak off stretching out replacement cycles for uses cases similar to mine in light of $aapl share prices.

back in january 2009 in florida we could have bought

4,000 apple shares as low as $78.20/share for under $313k or under $12.62m ($1=₱40.30)

after 28-for-1 split it would be 112,000 shares today.

at today's high of $155.04/share the portfolio would be nearly $17.365 million or nearly  ₱969.57 million ($1=₱55.84)

quarterly dividend resumed in 2012.

last quarter dividend would be $0.23/share so a total quarter dividend of $25,760 or nearly ₱1.44m.

# pattern: rectangle base breakout

**criteria:**

* stock is already trending (directional)
* price enters resting period where it goes sideways or coils
* the base must have a tight range and be clean (not wicky)
* lull in volume during consolidation period
* sloping ma catches up to price (8/20, 9/21, or whatever you use for trend analysis)
* increase in volume at the entry price
* must have room to run to next technical level (avoid false breakouts)

**optional:**

* shakeout bar which momentarily invalidates the base but recovers
* basing action should occur at the half dollar, whole dollar, or other significant level
* large orders sitting on bid/ask creating a wall at the top/bottom of rectangle

**entry:** 0.01 above/below the resistance/support line which forms the rectangle

**stop:** 0.02 above/below opposite side of the rectangle

**trade management:** if the breakout bar is immediately followed by a doji, move stop to the low/high of the indecision candle (no follow-through rule). otherwise manage accordingly.

**sample charts:**

* [$meta july 18, 2022](https://i.imgur.com/ja7yleg.png)
* [$nem july 25, 2022 (today actually)](https://i.imgur.com/4orsx1h.png)
* etc. etc.

you should mark-up the charts with the criteria, entry/stop, etc. even if it wasn't a trade you took. repeatability means consistency.

the important thing is that this call was expiring the day that pelosi exercised it. so the timing of the sale is at least somewhat coincidental. when he bought the options a year earlier, he was already committing to either sell or exercise them on june 17.

if he was operating on insider information, it was in deciding whether to sell those options to another trader or exercise them himself, which would have equivalent effects on his net worth, but afterward he has either 20k shares of nvidia or he has cash. he chose the option where he holds nvidia stock, and it was a good bet.",1,,rooktakesqueen,0

the article seems purposely misleading at worst, and woefully uninformed at best.

yes, he bought the nvda stock in 2022, by **exercising expiring options** he had already had.  the article links right to the disclosure: https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2022/20021374.pdf
&gt; transaction date 6/17/2022

&gt; exercised 200 call options (20,000 shares) expiring 6/17/22 at a strike price of $100.

when you have the option to buy share at $100, when the market price is $156.01 (june 16th 2022), you really only have two choices.  let the option expire, and flush everything spent down the drain.... or exercise the option and buy the shares for $100, for an on-paper profit of $56.01/share.

the bet/decision on the stock price going up or down was made **back when those options were acquired**, not when they were exercised.  pretending it's insider information in 2022 when the position was taken in june 2021 and july 2021 (see [here](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20019004.pdf) and 
[here](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20019331.pdf)).

&gt; purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $100 and an expiration date of 6/17/22.

those ""in the money"" options (stock price ~$180-200) certainly cost him money, at least $60/share to acquire back then.

1658918908,"i went from a z flip 3 to the mini 2 months ago. i am on 15.6 now and am really thinking of getting rid of this thing…
so this is feedback is from a guy using android as main os and ios as business device for years.

(+)
i came due to the bad battery life of the flip and wanted a small and portable device as the flip with better battery. the mini delivers. i get 5-6 sot with ease. i am confident with the battery in my daily life. upgrade in that regard (flip 3-4 hours).
(+)
apple features as wallet, faceid, compatibility to my ipad pro, apple stock apps are decent (reminders are nice) and being able to go to an apple store in case support is needed. the simple integration of these features into the os are still superb. with android you can achieve most of it too but it comes with some effort.
(+)
the main reason beside the battery was the size. a well put together device with an awesome inhand feel and perfect for one handed use.
(+) 
many high quality apps in store. android catches up but ios still has the upper hand. 
(+) 
besides the lens flares iphones still produce the best videos in the business.
(+)
updates 5-6 years.
(0)
speakers are just decent for the size.
(0)
customization in general is still a downside. nevertheless i can achieve a homescreen setup that is fine for me. the launcher essentially adapts the idea of action launcher from android. on the left you can aggregate some widgets and on the right you get the app library. you can even use blank widgets to get your app icons to where you want on the screen. ios is wandering in the right direction here. apple has still some things to do: freely arrange app icons without having to use blank widgets; make widgets interactive (they show some information but are essentially only links to the respective app).
(0)
60hz in general is no issue when the device is able to hold that frame rate. more in the negative section regarding this…
(0) 
photo cameras are pretty decent. 
(-)
the notification system still is far behind android. it would take too much time and space to explain it. the way you are able to interact with notifications on the lockscreen and also when notifications pop up in general and the way notifications are arranged is still superior on android. but i adapted my use. i simply don’t use the notification center and have the badges for app icons on. if i have messages i simply go directly into the app.
(-)
inconsistent back gesture. there are apps and certain situations where the back gesture doesn’t work. you have to remember those situations. sometimes the back gesture isn’t even recognized although the mini is so small. i don’t want to know how bad this is on the bigger iphone where you have trouble reaching the edge.
(-)
keyboard is still kind of horrible. the ai is miles behind googles. no matter how i configure the settings i can’t get it to work the way i want. it’s a mess when trying to use swiping. word recognition is bad. it doesn’t get context right and sometimes deletes more than one word. it’s horrible for me. tried google keyboard which is also not that good on ios and the most annoying part is apple kills the app in the background and many times the keyboard changes to the one of apple or in the worst case doesn’t even open.
(-)
probably the reason i will have to part ways again: the performance!!
honestly i would have never thought that this might be the case. 
let me explain:
in general the device is fast although animations are still really slow and apple could speed them up just a little bit (reduce motion feature doesn’t speed up the device it just eliminates the animations). as the device has the strongest mobile processor this is expected. nevertheless ios 15 ruins the whole experience. from day one the device runs like shit. opening and closing apps most of the times is stuttering and frames are dropping. fotmob is one of my favorite and most used apps. nearly every time i open the app the animation stutters (feel free to test the app). this happens so many times a day it is driving me nuts. did all the resets possible even use dfu 2 times, went to apple store and the hardware is fine. they told me to wait for a software update. the devices in the store are also struggling with that issue. i waited for 15.6 and no improvement… i think i can’t handle this anymore. it destroys the whole user experience. btw my xr business device with 15.5 and now 15.6 runs smoother than the 13 mini…
(-)
in addition the touch response is worse than the ones on 120hz screens. this is expected due to the technology, nevertheless from time to time it is noticeable. but even worse is the fact, that the phone doesn’t take input from time to time. this mostly occurs in the upper half in the corners of the screen. again: apple checked the hardware and it is fine… i guess this is another software issue. sometimes the hit boxes of a field dont match the visual appearance of it.

so in general i would say try the device out. it is small, has good cameras, good battery life for its size and the general apple benefits. on the other hand there are the typical apple issues and compromises and at the moment even more small issues untypical for apple. worst case you hand it back to apple within 14 days…",1,,HuffyFuffy,0

1658948111,"&gt;to be very pedantic, it's only an investment if you are using the capital to acquire something that you intent to sell later on for a profit.

that's incorrect. it's an investment because it becomes an asset you hold that absoltuly contributes to your networth. renting is not an investment cuz that money is gone. you buy a house you have the asset. you can sell it or not like all assets. it's no different than buying apple stock. you buy it and can sell it if you'd like to or not. you can take your house that you own to a bank and use it to secure a huge loan. that's because you've paid to own something. it's not a car that depreciates with time and is continually worth less. and i think that's the main thing people miss when they're considering renting vs investing in the place you live.  

&gt;beyond that, it's a numbers game. no matter what you do, you are always going to have costs (e.g., property tax, maintenance, etc.) that need to be covered if you own real estate. however, if your total monthly cost of ownership is less than you would pay in rent - practically for short term purchases - then you are in a much more financially secure position (and ideally now have income that can be converted to investments)

absolutely not. i don't know what your income/rent situation is like but 1500-2000 rent a month adds up. yea there's expenses to owning a house but if you're rich enough that you can afford to throw away 2k a month and still have 1000s left to invest more than you would investing 3k on a house then you don't really have problems with covering a mortgage. you would need 5000 disposable net income after all your expenses to to rent a 2k a month place and make the same investments in products that are not going to have the same stability or returns.

the math is really so simple. you spend 2k a month and invest 1k. that's 3k a month to save/invest 1. buy a house for 500k you spend 3k and invest 3k. interest is front-loaded but that means on the back end of that deal your payments will be so nominal you're going to win out should you stay. and real estate does tend to go up if you live in any kind of decent area where home prices are going to push to uncomfortable levels.

&gt;depending upon market conditions, it's very easy to fall into a position where the total cost of ownership is more than renting and the break-even could be 30+ years in the future.

i mean no it's not. because paying for your house isn't actually a cost. it's an investment. like i said the total cost of renting and investing 3k a month is actually 5k. the total cost of payments to invest the 3k in your home is 3k. sure there's property taxes and some bills but it's literally 100s a month and not breaking people down. and at the end of renting for 5 years i have nothing but my savings to show for it. at the end of owning for 5 years i own a percentage of the principal that i've paid off.

but beyond that, and i like to think of the interest portion as a simple option payment that entitles me to 100% of the appreciation value of the house. we bought 2 years ago quite strategically along a main street that was about to be developed. my interest payment is just the right to have a call option at whatever price it's at. so far it's grown the better part of a million dollars above what we paid. maybe 3/4 of a million? i've paid roughly 80k in payments. about 40 of that has gone to the principal. but i own the call option and have paid 40k, so far, for something that's gone up 3/4s of a million. right now, i can sell the house and go retire to an island in se asia. that's an option i have. and i've paid 40k for that option. in another year i'll have paid 60k while the appreciation compounds and inflation reduces my interest payment/costs of holding the asset and i own even more of the principal.

40k for 3/4s of a million. no dude. that is the definition of an investment. and here's the real kicker. becasue we bought strategically in a great location we airbnb the basement, something most renters are not allowed to do and lack the space to do, so we don't actually pay for our mortgage or property tax. we went from paying 2k a month with 0 returns to paying nothing while profiting about 5 or 600 a month to get a return of nearly a million dollars. that's only bound to dramatically increase when the condos and transit they are planning go in.

that's the difference between rent and total cost of ownership. ownership. it's a massive, immense difference that gives you control of your life and finances so long as you go about it the right way.",1,,SayMyVagina,0

eventually, years from now, more high-end semiconductor manufacturing lines will be available for nvidia to buy more fab time to make more gpus.

so, years from now, maybe nvidia stock might tick upwards and gradually grow.

buying and selling nvidia stock right now essentially means nothing.

if he had good insider information, he would've bought nvidia stock when they announced their deal to acquire arm, and then find the right time to sell the stock at its highest value before nvidia would announce that it was giving up on acquiring them. but that was earlier in the year.

for investors, nvidia has to release new product, but for sales they really don't want to. nvidia stock has taken a big hit in the past week because they aren't getting any of that chip manufacturing stimulus like intel who's getting $20 billion, because nvidia doesn't have their own fab facilities. investors have finally realized that with gpu mining drying up, nvidia isn't a good investment.

sorry for sloppy formatting.  i'm too lazy to do much on mobile. gonna repost this on the daily thread tomorrow morning.   would love to hear if there are any factors (for or against) that i missed 

about 85% of apple revenue is hardware sales which is unique among big tech and actually closer to amazon than google.  2021 was a massively successful year for apple due to stimmy (increased revenue of 33% yoy with iphones up 42% yoy) compared to much smaller increases previous years (10-20%).  in fact, iphone sales, the main driver, were actually declining prior to the pandemic.  all the new iphones purchased in 2021 will likely dampen sales for next generation as iphones do not need to be replaced every year.

additonally, q3 is already a low sales quarter due to anticipation of new iphone release next quarter.  however,  this could actually mitigate a drop in sales this quarter as management could dismiss it as people just waiting for the new iphone generation.  

altogether, i think aapl is overvalued and primed for correction, especially since it has fallen the least among big tech. basically, apple is the biggest pandemic stock but hasn't yet come back to earth like zoom or peleton or amazon.  it is still priced like its 2021 performance will continue, but i think that is unlikely to be the case.  however,  that doesn't necessarily mean that this theory will be realized in this earnings report.  

other factors pointing to a big miss;

-currency exchange rate (negative impact for approx 33% of revenue (europe and japan)

-china lockdowns and disturbances

factors against a big miss:

apple consumer typically wealthy and less impacted by inflation 

apple hasn't provides guidance, so bad guidance can't provide a negative shock.

i've only been able to find two instances that raised major red flags.

1.) her husband sold alphabet stock just before a house vote on antitrust actions. which certainly looks suspicious, but he sold the options the day the expired. that doesn't preclude shenanigans, but it appears to be within the letter of the law.

2.) her husband's recent sale of nvidia stock. but since he sold them before the chips vote at a loss, they're pretty terrible at insider trading if that's what's going on. (or it could be a one-time ploy to take some heat off of them)

the fact that both of those appear to be within the letter of the law is an indicator to me that the law needs strengthened. i absolutely think that every member of congress should be required to place all assets in a blind trust that isn't managed by a relative or close contact.",1,,sc1003,0

he then proceeded to dump those stocks at a loss, so what exactly are we supposed to be outraged about anyway?

this is not the insider trading we are concerned about.  the insider trading we should be concerned about are congress members dumping their stocks before lockdown, while at the same time telling the public covid was not going to be a big deal.

it wasn't a hobby. it was a means to an end

- getting entertainment on the day of release instead of waiting months for it to broadcast in my country

- getting 720p &amp; 1080p audio &amp; video quality that are better than 480i [linear tv](https://mountain.com/blog/linear-tv-versus-performance-tv/) or movie theaters. 

- save time by by-passing ads of products you'd never buy.

- get better quality sleep on work days by not having to follow the tv schedule so i can sleep by 8pm and wake up after 4am for 8 or more hours of sleep. it helps with emotional turmoil and improved productivity.

- binge watch during the weekend &amp; holidays

sure, it felt like you won a race when you bought the largest hdd sku available the week of release but in hindsight it was stupid use of money.

pwc, oecd, citi bank, etc. many companies/intergovernmental institutions have economic projections.

&gt;but you went a step further and used ppp, instead of nominal.

it's hilarious. whenever europeans compare with the us they use ppp but when it comes to other countries they use nominal.

regardless, if you prefer nominal gdp would you be okay with accepting that the eu hasn't even recovered from the 2008 crisis yet? 14 years?

the best argument against ngdp is looking at places like saudi arabia, singapore, and hong kong. hong kong has enough foreign reserves to over cut half its exchange rate and double the value of its currency before the closing of the financial year and doubles the value of all *past transactions.* yes, the hong kong monetary authority can double its gdp by changing the exchange rate right before the books close.

anyways, your argument is poor. the entire purpose of ppp adjustments is ***because differences in nominal prices don't accurately capture real value.*** the most popular example of certain mcdonald's menu items costing $8-$9 in norway but $1.80 in egypt despite being the same exact product. and yes, some of the adjustments do include quality, especially in healthcare.

&gt;first of all, you ignored that nigeria has more than 3x the population of france

irrelevant to global politics. no one is talking about monaco, luxembourg, or uae being a great power. but people do talk about china a lot despite china having a smaller gdp per capita than some tiny sub saharan african nations.

1659162816,"it was my grandfather's birthday, i made him a gift and i was excited to give it to him, i was, i want to say 7 or 8. he wanted to have dinner at longhorn steakhouse. now, i had never been there. my dad and brothers knew nothing of my fear, and my mom had never been to longhorn so not going there waan't even on her radar. obviously i had never been there, so i was excited to hell and back to see my grandpa and give him the gift i made for him. when we had arrived i was so excited in fact i ran right into the restaurant, right up to them and didn't look around. i just handed him my gift, and he was happy...i felt eyes baring into my back(let me know if anyone else just knows when they're there, i feel like i do, it's like a 6th sense.) i was...confused, i felt stared at, it made me uncomfortable, it's like my body just knew. i decided to look and when i say my thought process was this, i'm not kidding. when i looked ahead i was like oh cool ranchers wrangling hourses in paintings cool....bone horned skull thing? unsettled but cool i guess, painting, tables(no one's looking at me.) bull head, front do-

when i say i did the biggest whiplash of all time. i did and just like i did the time before, i screamed and started crying. i swear this steer head felt as big as the wall itself, i waa so horrified. also to the designer of this particular longhorn for making the doors pull not push, fuck you. i mean it. fuck. you. because i looked between that steer and the door that would not open, and eventually i pulled it open and i booked it so fast out of the restaurant. i ran into my parents who looked concerned because their daughter is crying for seemingly no reason. big mistake because my dad is a person of, don't be such a p$$v, man up and deal with it. and yes, he would say that to me still his own daughter, and i knew he wouldn't react well, but i refused. i was not going back into that restaurant. as i told my mom, she immediately had my back because she remembered my outburst at the boot shop, my dad however was like it's stuffed, big deal, stop crying and get into the fucking restaurant. to which i told him i would wait in the car. that surprised him to say the least because i loved food, especially steak, and all i could talk about waa how hungry i was on the car ride here. so for a child to say yeah i'd rather starve he instantly felt like i was overreacting a bit, but then was a little nervous something was up, because it's unlike me. after much convincing we came in through the back and ate in a room with nothing there. happy end, but now it was on my whole family's radar that taxidermy was a big no no for me.

my mother completely believed i had a phobia, my dad thought i was just being a scared kid. but everyone else agreed with my mom. if it wasn't a phobia, why did i have that reaction then? children don't just do that for no reason, and especially not to an extent of running or having a full blown panic attack. my mom still tells people how horrific my screams were to her, because no one believes it instills a fight or flight response in me untill they see it for themselves.

well fast forward, i had many awful encounters, and now it's a given that we cannot go anywhere with taxidermy. i also go to therapy for my mental disorders(depression, anxiety, and ptsd, not important, but not for the phobia.) one day i decided to talk to my therapist about this, because my father believed it waa just me, and it was embarrassing for me, because i was the only person in the world with this fear. i thought i was, it was so ridiculous, i mean a fear of stuffed, dead animals? people still laugh at me when i say i am. i had decided to mention it because at the time i had a recent encounter, and it scared the ever living hell out of me. i told her about it, and she basically analyzed me as i talked. i have a good therapist, truly, she genuinely cares and is always alert with how i act as well as what i say(yes it's her job, but some therapists are dirt shit.) anyway, when i finished i asked her, straight up. i asked if it is a phobia, because i can't even talk about the memories of it without looking around my room, the nightmares, or even pictures. i told her how i would react and how i just felt so scared, and she confirmed for me that it was indeed a phobia. she had never met anyone else with it, but she assured me that if i had it then other people did too, and if it was a classified one, it wasn't common. she had told me that i can tell people no, because it is a valid phobia, it makes me feel awful, and if they can't get that to ask them why they fear their particular phobia, if they have one.

in short, yes, yes it is. she told me she didn't know the name if it was a classified phobia, but that i definitely had one, and anyone that says it's not a phobia because it's ridiculous, has never had a phobia or doesn't understand what phobia means, because from what she saw, it was a very real fear. and that's not just a sympathetic person, or an outsider, that was a legit, licensed therapist who went to school for this shit to diagnose people and psychoanalyze them. so if that makes anyone feel better, happy to have shared this then, because hearing i wasn't the only one made me feel better too. and hearing from my therapist that my fear is real, that it is a real phobia made me feel better too, and i hope it made you guys feel slightly relieved too, have a nice day, and hope you guys don't run into taxidermy. 😭🤚(3/3)",1,,RavioliTornado,0

for buy and hold investors it is definately not zero sum.  aapl being worth $180 in 2 years creates net wealth that isn't taken from anyone else.

also think about this the market can also have net destruction of value.  aapl goes down to $130.  real wealth is destroyed and it isn't a zero sum.  there is not an entity collecting dollar for dollar the loss in value on aapl stock.

tbh netflix would be my last choice to buy shares as they're a 1 trick pony. their stock shares tanked of late due to people cutting their subscriptions. my guess is they're all fed up covid-induced binge watching and want to be social being again.

from my 2 decades of download perspective netflix serves subscribers who

- do not want to become datahoarders
- want to pay the equivalent of a cable subscription
- want the flexibility of anywhere with a 5mbps or better internet connection i can watch hollywood-class productions
- live in countries with isps that actually block p2p file sharing

old enough to complain about lost opportunities. i air my failures to execute so people younger than me can learn from them. the vets look at it as hindsight 20/20 and people full of themselves think it's ""weird"".

i envy every k-12 student who visit /r/phinvest asking for help to be financially literate. if i had initiative &amp; helpful strangers pointing to me to resources that aren't pushed by a person looking for a commission i'd probably have more than $20 million of equities by now.

here's one example below.

i made moves to sign up for e*trade in 2008 to indulge my apple fanboi impulses by buying $aapl.

this was 1 year after the 2007 iphone 2g came out and the insane lines to get one. back then smuggling of iphones from the us to ph and even ru was such a big thing. so i knew it was gonna be a hit.

this was also the year that bitcoin came out due to the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp)

back then i was irrationally in love with the company because of their awesome products. 

since 2000 i have been keeping track of all rumors &amp; news about apple on a 1/2 day basis. so why not own part of a resurging company that made a splash with the imac, ipod and now the iphone?

knowing the company you invest in and knowing day-to-day operations and long term planning is key to being a good stock investor.

1659217189,"u/codf is right. 

there is a difference in trading apple stock with a spread of (say) 0.08% (+commissions) where prices and the spread are created by interaction of millions of investors in the market place. 

with cfd:s, your spread could be 0.2% and it is largely set by a single party, your broker. he will have a superior bargaining position to you, setting the spread, and will protect his interests. your stop-loss executions are at the mercy of your broker’s predatory instincts. just when you need it to kick in sharply, you could see a significant slip. and when you definitely did not want or expect the stop-loss to be triggered, it nevertheless is. you pay. all this means you must expect to lose on average, just like in the casino. these kind of things also can happen with really thinly traded small stocks. the bid-ask spread is wide and can behave erratically. 

the more you trade, the less trading volume there is on the cfd (which you often don’t even know), and the higher leverage you use, the larger are your losses over time. 

if you buy and hold the market, say a world stock market etf, for a longer time with no or moderate leverage, it could be okay. the disadvantageous spread gets amortized over a long holding period hurting you less, as you only buy once and sell once - after 15 years. 

btw: check if cfd losses are tax deductible. i don’t know about the us, but in some eu countries, cfd losses are not tax deductible whereas direct trading with stocks and etf:s are. makes a big difference in the long run. you can always buy world stocks through an etf instead of a cfd and get full tax deductability (should it go south for the first three years or so).",1,,Dune89-sky,0

(yes you can look at historical gdp and come up with a number but we are looking at ex-ante risk, not historical). i wouldn't get too hung up on the differences as the reading is meant more for a basic understanding of risk models and their factors.",6,,thejdobs,0
1659298755,"if you have a paid off home, there are zero cheaper options.

doesn’t seem right to me to evict people from paid off homes because they can no longer afford property taxes.

property tax is the only tax paid without selling an asset.  you could have $10,000,000 worth of apple stock that you paid $100 for, but until you sell, you pay zero taxes on it.

grandma, living in the home her husband built with his own hands, is expected to pay yearly on an assessed value?  not even the purchase price.

1659306481,"the biggest problem with my crypto is that it's staked so i can't liquidate it until after the merge happens, so i can't reduce my allocation other than increasing allocations to my other investments. 
i'm very bullish on tech, though i would love if the valuations weren't so absurd. i do know qqq and brkb give me a very large allocation to apple stock which i don't mind because the fcf is great.
berkshire to me is basically a thousand hedges and largely works with progressive, i just like it because i feel it declines less when the overall market goes down so i usually up my stake when the market hits highs and sell some to dca as markets fall.
right now i put 6k in my ira, 7% with a 4% match in my 401k which is around 10k and i save about 70k in my individual retirement account which isn't tax advantaged.
