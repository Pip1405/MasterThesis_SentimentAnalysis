1656710799,"if the 2007 crisis is any indication, what's going on right now is that vultures with cash are buying up the best assets from these companies. 

the other thing that's happening is that distressed companies are trying to *convince* the vultures that what they have is valuable, and sometimes [the vultures will get burned.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldmansachs-lawsuit/goldman-sued-for-1-07-billion-over-timberwolf-cdo-idustre79r4je20111028)

*""timberwolf was cited in a scathing u.s. senate panel report in april that faulted goldman, deutsche bank ag dbkgn.de and others for hawking debt they expected to perform poorly.*

*that report said goldman kept marketing timberwolf even after thomas montag, an executive who is now bank of america corp's bac.n co-chief operating officer, in an email to a colleague called timberwolf ""one shitty deal.""*

*in the new complaint, the basis yield fund said it entered $80.8 million of credit default swaps related to “triple-a” and “double-a” rated timberwolf debt. it said it also bought $12.3 million of “triple-b” rated debt tied to subprime residential mortgages and issued by another cdo, point pleasant 2007-1.*

*these transactions, the fund said, “provided a vehicle for goldman to unload its toxic inventory and to profit from the decline in value of the very securities it was recommending that its clients purchase.”*

goldman, it added, even offered sales staff “ginormous” credits to shed the securities.

within weeks, the transactions began to tumble in value, and basis yield began to liquidate within two months. it said it lost $56.3 million on timberwolf in less than six weeks, and $10.8 million on point pleasant in less than three months.""*",19,,Gary_Glidewell,0

1656972873,"“the value of global mergers announced so far this year is around $2.1 trillion, down a fifth from the same period of 2021, according to data from refinitiv. that’s despite big transactions, like microsoft’s (msft.o) $69 billion acquisition of games group activision blizzard (atvi.o) and software maker vmware’s (vmw.n) $61 billion union with chip giant broadcom (avgo.o). the amount raised through ipos around the globe plunged by almost two-thirds to less than $70 billion as equity markets – especially technology firms – sold off.

bankers from goldman sachs (gs.n), jpmorgan (jpm.n) and morgan stanley (ms.n) are therefore fighting over a shrinking pie. investment banking fees were $24.8 billion in the second quarter, according to refinitiv – the lowest quarterly tally since the third quarter of 2018.

that puts the onus on investment bankers to be more creative. often advisers pitch ideas that are within a reasonable bandwidth of expected outcomes. but corporate chieftains who have spent the past two years grappling with the covid-19 pandemic and the consequences of russia’s invasion of ukraine are justifiably concerned about so-called tail risks, or the chance that another unforeseen event could sideswipe their business.

they aren’t paranoid. late tuesday u.s. officials said that they were ramping up efforts to vaccinate people against monkeypox. that’s why investment bankers are increasingly pitching contingency plans for a range of hard-to-predict outcomes. it could be a while before ceos return to dealmaking. dealmakers prepared to engage in corporate finance science fiction have a better chance of getting a hearing.”

4. a drs share is better than shares that can be used against gs stock.

you've seen how big the corruption is. why not be proactive and have a cs with one share just in case.

you will probably be fine assuming your broker did not remove buy button last year. will provide share comes split dividend instead of cash. not with apex clearing house. have not done anything shady since jan 2021. then you are probably will be fine. again ""probably"" because we don't know, no one knows what will happen once shit hits the fan.

1657683140,"it's almost impossible to say.  even with the 2005 tax return where he paid $38 million - the only thing it tells you is that he is definitely rich - i don't know what the tax brackets were in 2005, but he withdrew enough from his businesses that he claimed personal income on an amount that resulted in paying $38 million in taxes...but billionaire is hard to ever know. personal income tax and business tax are so intertwined for someone like him that its hard to even know where the line should or shouldn't be drawn.  kinda how we used to tie bill gate's net worth to his ms stock and it fluctuated day by day and he would be the richest and then not the richest overnight and then suddenly rich again.  you would need to know what his combined assets are worth and how much his businesses were making vs. losing.  cpas spend a lot of time trying to make personal spending look like it relates to business spending.  so anything you can associate with the business doesn't get looped into someone's individual income taxes...it is written off as a business expense.  the more they throw in the ""business expense"" category the less income that gets counted towards the individual and the less a business will have to pay at the end of the tax year.  so its really important to try to classify as much as possible as a business expense because it lowers gains made by the business and income associated with the individual.  this is also what makes tax audits nuts and why they are so long and drawn out...irs has to prove you lied and you have to prove you didn't, etc.  trump didn't withdrawal $50 million, pay taxes on that money and use it to buy a helicopter. no, the company buys it and it is written off as a business expense. $50 million the company doesn't have to pay in taxes and its something trump can use at will and never truly had to pay for out of his pocket.  granted, his company did need to have the cash available to pay for it.  and this is legal to do even though there are massive amounts of grey areas and loop holes.  i'll give you an example:  

business owner: ""i went on a trip"" cpa:  did you meet anybody related to business there?""  business owner: ""yes""  *wink wink* cpa:  okay then we can deduct it as a business expense and won't count it as a withdrawal that would balloon your personal tax income.  
  
a cpa is trying to make their clients look poor by counting their lifestyle expenses as business expenses.  cars, trips, phone, internet, rent, etc all can be written off within the legal bounds of the tax law...but there's a lot of it that probably should go towards personal income that should be taxed.  this is how these massive billion dollar companies end up paying $0 in taxes.  simple example, but a business has a billion dollars in profit...your choices are pay corporate taxes on that billion or divide it up to all your shareholders or execs in the form of bonuses/dividends.  that billion now gets counted as an expense and the company pays 0 in corporate taxes.
sorry for the long tirade that should have been focused at trump...but some simple understanding of tax and how it applies to businesses and individuals is good to know before you start examining things further.",48,,cz_masterrace3,0

&gt;the best way to prevent inflation from eroding the value of your savings is to simply have no savings",1,,HuzzahBot,0
1657720853,i'm pretty sure $jpm has more potential to short,1,,SadValue9972,0
1657722408,"you're welcome.  i don't understand why anyone would be rude to you for asking a genuine question.

so there are many different sources of estimates.  here's a quick list of some of the estimates from the whales on wall street.  this was published yesterday before the cpi report came out.

bank of america, $bac: 8.7% 

jpmorgan, $jpm: 8.7% 

credit suisse, $cs: 8.8% 

morgan stanley, $ms: 8.8% 

bloomberg consensus: 8.8% 

citi, $c: 8.9% 

goldman sachs, $gs: 8.9%

the trajectory is based on too many factors for us to get into but the overarching consensus was that while the headline number would print a higher cpi, the rate of change would have been stable if not lower, thus signaling that we are at or near the peak.  

so we went from 8.3 to 8.6 to 9.1.  a simple way to think about it is that the previous report saw the headline go up .3 and this report saw the headline go up .5 thus signaling an increase in the rate of inflation.  if the headline read 8.9 today then it would mean we had consecutive yoy increases of .3 and another .3 potentially signaling that we have peaked in the rate of increase in inflation.  so in this context that 0.3% difference is a huge deal.  it's the difference between the rate of increase of inflation slowing versus the rate of increase of inflation increasing.  

one bit of warning to anyone who cares to read it but i do think the next cpi print has a chance of surprising to the downside.  commodities have taken a massive hit recently that has not yet been calculated into today's cpi report.  also one more thing to factor in is that cpi is inherently a lagging indicator and your potential investment decisions should be adjusted accordingly.",14,,BBQCHICKENALERT,0

https://www.reddit.com/r/hydro/comments/eqr0yo/masterblend_stock_solution_32oz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

that post described making 32 ounce stock solutions. it's as if he set out to make three 32-ounce stock solutions, but in his part a, he put all the amounts of mb and ms in one 32 ounce bottle. and all the cn in the other bottle. so any portion of bottle a contains both the mb and ms that would be in that amount of stock solution a. and the same volume from bottle b contains all the cn that would be in that volume of stock solution b. 

therefore, taking 15ml of a is the same amounts of mb and ms as using 15ml of separate stocks of mb and ms. the difference in water content, 15 ml less water, is trivial at that concentration; in a gallon, almost 4000 ml, that's nothing. 

if he had indeed made up three stock solutions, 32 ounces for each of the three ingredients, he would still use 15ml of each per gallon. he would pick up an extra 15ml of water no matter how the stocks are prepared, 15 ml of each still makes one gallon of working. 

i do something similar. i make up three one-liter stock solutions, one for each ingredient. and i use the same amount of each ingredient in each stock bottle. so when i use it, i only use half the ms stock solution per gallon, 7.5 ml. 

note that the directions are for making using the stock solutions in lettuce dilution. i use 155g/155g/155g in my stock liters, so 15ml/15ml/7.5ml per gallon of mine is tomato dilution, and i just use proportionally less for lettuce. you will just use more of each for tomatoes.",2,,IntheHotofTexas,0

bill gates should absolutely be commended for encouraging other tres comas club members (hbo's silicon valley reference to billionaires)--people like warren buffet, to not pass on their wealth to their grandchildren and well beyond.  i think it would have been better to have been collecting this money as taxes rather than projects selected by his foundation/his discretion.  bill is just 1 billionaire.  taxes would have better leveraged and if done collectively, would go further, to address some of the biggest issues of our day:  it could take a big bite out of the wealth gap by funding programs to help people get on their feet, build respectable, cheap housing, reduce health care costs, provide a hell of a lot more police training/vetting, and make american society more equitable. (nothing against the gates foundation, i know that they have saved countless lives in africa and elsewhere but these too were once noble goals that the us did collectively in the past--as a country (and not just one man's crusade)).  perhaps what we should do is have the uber wealthy pay for the military/security costs, and the rest of us pay for the rest.  this would prevent wars for sure, but i also know that social security is a big part of the government's debt.",1,,Abject_Ad1879,0

1658188428,"..that's not really how any of this works. the best point you could make is that the largest shareholders of those public companies are biased and give them preferential treatment via generous evaluations when deciding how much to allocate etc. and then try and imagine how that would even work in practice given that these are major companies and their price is determined by a very large number of participants, across the planet.. through the stock market. 


first off everyone thinks the company they hold is worth more, or is potentially worth more than it is, or that it is at least a good place to store capital. or they would sell it and buy something else. at the end of the day, the largest shareholders of these banks are funds like blackrock and vanguard etc. the banks compete with the other banks, and the funds try to get the best bang for their buck. they are not propping up each other's stock prices because they are buddies. they are more like enemies. the other banks helped short bear sterns to death when they sensed weakness in 2008. if a fund manager thought he would get a better return somewhere else, he would. that's how capital markets work in essence. you could argue the us government fucked that up in 2008, and you'd be right, but that isn't even your point. 


your problem seems to be with the fact that growth stocks get beat up after any earnings, and banks don't, and that it isn't fair. let me help you out. what you don't realize is, that in a raging bull market expectations of new growth companies are almost always overly optimistic. by a lot. 


so when the earnings come in, and they 'beat' them, and they go down in price... it's rigged! well, in reality, the price went down because those investors were not hoping for a minor beat, they wanted it smashed out of the park, and when that didn't happen, they go and look for another hitter somewhere else. go look up what happened with shop or amd or tsla, amzn or fuck any of the famous growth stocks, over any period in history, as they were coming up, and when they had a ko earnings. the insanity afterwards. the insane runs that followed... basically the markets since the fiscal/monetary bukkake (which isn't normal). that's the bet you didn't know you were in. that's what the investors risking money in growth wanted to see happen. if it's a bear market, it's the same concept but the assumption is you suck and i'm selling unless you perform a miracle. 



so yeah, if i'm investing in joe flip flops nft burgers, unless the earnings beat drastically exceeded the expectations, i'm probably not too happy. that's a risky spot to park capital, i want high returns for that risk. otherwise, i'd put it with fucking goldman sachs, which might make less money this year, but it's also a safe business. banks were already stable well established businesses, before the government fucked everything up, and declared them too big to fail, so they are now even more appealing from a risk perspective. 



and that is why, in general, some companies, sometimes drop after an earnings beat, and why banks don't plummet to the ground when they miss. but to prove my first claim, that markets, are well, markets, go look up the charts of $cs or $db right now or the american banks in 08/09 or 2020. or *drumroll* goldman sachs ($gs)... today. it's been massacred year to date lmao. it looks like a growth stock ffs. what was your theory again? because based on that chart, even if you were right, it was irrelevant anyway. 



banks can and will be sold off brutally if the investors no longer consider them a safe investment. if a bank were risky, i'd rather invest with that stupid nft burger guy because the returns could be far greater than a normal bank stock. if a bank is merely less profitable, it may be sold off as well, but not in a panic generally like with growth stocks. banks get violently sold off when collapse/credit crisis fears get going. usually anyways.



in this instance, the issue occurred because of the central bankers literally losing their fucking minds. due to the covid lockdowns, and subsequent prolonged abuse of cocaine, mescaline, cialis, and monopoly, they came to sincerely believe they could mail free money to everyone, without it affecting the value of that money. then they made the stock market double! for no good reason at all either. they were planning on doing it again too, before they were given a much-needed intervention, and agreed to seek professional help. i'm not even sure if that part is a joke or not to be honest.",3,,TortoiseStomper69694,0

1658203265,"yes. it’s definitely achievable but it takes time. if you want dividends coming in and treat it like income you want to live off of, you’ll need a mixture of growth and high yield stocks. too many times people are wondering if they should be doing strictly high yields with lower growth or lower yields with higher growth. i think the answer lies between the middle, why not have both. for example, $jpm stock price provides room for growth and it has a dividend. company is strong but dividend yield won’t be as high as let’s say a company like $main. main st capital is a business development company that won’t offer you a high growth in stock price, but their dividend yields are attractive. instead of choosing one, do both. no one said you had to choose one. i think we fall into a trap of forcing ourselves to pick one or the other. if you diversify, youll lower your risk throughout ur portfolio. gains will be smaller but for me, if it means sleeping better at night, so be it.",1,,becheezyman,0

you could also acquire a large amount of wells fargo stock, get a seat on their board, and probably then you'd get some answers :)

you could always try writing a letter or email to their executive offices but you'll probably just get a generic response along the lines of ""we are not offering a product change today, and we can't say right now if we ever will.""

personally my plan is pc if/when that is ever offered. if, before then, i know of a large purchase in a 3x category coming up (and the sub is still available) i might apply for a fresh account (and then move my cl from the propel over to the autograph before closing it completely.)  it's not too hard to spend $1500 on travel, so that is a distinct possibility. otherwise i'll just hang on to propel -- day to day the differences between propel and autograph are pretty minor (given that i have no international travel planned at this time.)",1,,bllfr0g,0

how do you handle all these connections, since closing them requires invoking the btc chain?: the only explanation ive heard so far is: just leave the connection open. sure you noticed that this means your funds are locked. so if you are walmart, you simply need a small sum of 600 billion dollars of collateral per year to recieve your money. the customers 600bil is also locked, but they spent it, so thats ok.

that said, i have heard that some bitcoiners propose to have nodes who provide capital as collateral, so walmart doent need those 600b (a banking node provides it). goldman sachs for example could run one of these nodes, or maybe the federal reserve. these nodes could also provide anonymity to these transactions since the recorded tx is from $gs to walmart. 

though i feel like doing bitcoin transactions through a banking node kinda defeats the purpose of bitcoin and really is not as anonymous as butters claim. also think of the massive risk $gs would take to provide those massive loans that may never close because they are split into such small fractions. 

so yeah, lightning will never work at scale because of its core design. its almost as dumb as bitcoin.",2,,ImpiusEst,0

centrists who pay attention to progressives might vote “right”

centrists who pay attention to trump &amp; co. probably vote left.

antiwork is fairly progressive, but they have a point…i think.

all the job exporting from the 80s was bad for blue collar americans, great for wall street. 

this would seem to push people left…but no…

blue wants to provide handouts and free college and free … 

this pushes folks back to the right because all that shit costs real money. 

not a lot of politicians out there doing the good of the people. they serve the extremes…and centrists get nothing but hate. 

liz cheney is gonna get primaried. she’s a good egg. 

tangential…but relevant. 

minimum wage should have been pegged to inflation years ago…however, that stands in the way of jeff bezos becoming a trillionaire, so, no! 

to that end, antiwork has a point.

but, as a gen x dude…

i only made minimum wage as a high school kid. 

i joined the navy out of high school and minimum wage never meant anything to me ever since.

antiwork is anti military…trust me or test it as u see fit. 

to that end, they are dead to me.

military got me out of being a renter… paid for me to go to college… sent me to flight school…

navy was damn good to me. 

but u gotta break out. how did i break out? i made the shitters look brand new. the chief said you’re not cleaning shitters anymore…you’re cleaning my office. he put me on a trajectory to never be on the bottom of the pile ever again. 

i digress, but, that relationship doesn’t exist in antiwork. 

so…it’s a mixed bag. 

i wish we didn’t export manufacturing to china, i wish we didn’t pay executives $ms and treat the help like shit, but…i also wish there were folks out there trying to make a couple toilets look brand new. not convinced that antiwork folks are willing to scrub shitters.

amzn was iffy and they freaking rocketed

aapl is basically flat to 1-1.5years ago with much higher trading price and moons

intc started falling years ago when they sat on the same re-released chips year over year while tsm/amd blew them buy on price/perf. then they went heavy into av and now trying to focus back into procs. they have no direction or leadership it seems.

i normally just go with just 1 option so gains are small  (between $4.71 to $50 per option) but i'm ok with that.  it's enough to pay my monthly phone/internet/junk food bills.

also with csp, you need the cash to cover as i don't do margins, i use a $50k bank which is earning better % than leaving in a savings account",1,,jyep9999,0
