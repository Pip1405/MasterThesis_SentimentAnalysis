i think the selloff in financials is wholly unsubstantiated. jpm already dropped after their announcement of increased ops spending and reduced profitability guidance. none of the us banks, including citi with its meagerly $10b exposure, have substantial risk in the west‚Äôs dealing with sanctions. i think this is the market panicking and valuations will rise in the following weeks and months.

something similar happened to ms in january when gs and jpm had disappointing earnings: it dropped a full 10% before recovering to ath. i think the fundamentals of ‚Äúyou invest in value financials when interest rate hikes are coming‚Äù is solid, that‚Äôs why i bought ms two days ago.",2,,[deleted],0

1646432050,"crazy week, i initiated 16 spreads and exited 8 of them for profit. i did a good job of balancing my portfolio based on changing market conditions but the uncertainty of each day made me close my failing positions early and open new positions going with the market trend. 

of the 8 failed trades, 3 positions ($unp cds, $c pds, $ms pds) could have been closed for breakeven and a further 3 positions  ($tsm pds, $x cds, $clf cds) could have been closed at maximum profit if i simply held for longer. this would have pushed my success rate from 50% to 87%. 

of the 8 the profitable trades. 4 trades were closed early ($rrc cds, $rcl pds, $ual pds, $trip pds) that could have been closed for maximum profit. the remaining 4 trades were closed extremely close to maximum profit to generate funds for additional trades. 

of the 8 failed trades, 2 trades ($ip pds, and $cvx cds made halfway through today) were genuine analysis mistakes on my part and were incorrect reads on the market. i'm particularly disappointed in myself for making the $cvx cds as i sold my $cvx pds i got this morning for profit and got a little trigger happy and tried predicting a reversal. i'm embarassed about this one. the $ip pds seemed like a correct read on the market so i don't fully understand why this one failed but i exited early and it seems like there was no chance of profit or breakeven after i exited. i'll be analyzing this one closely. for now i need to address my primary instincts of closing early. albeit these unstable market conditions are making it difficult.",3,,[deleted],0

[it‚Äôs cause canada actually exports fuel, food, and fertilizer.  we will see a huge cash inflow into canada from these products as long as the sanctions on russia continue.  it is such a huge win for the west and will impose no pain on the central and east of canada.  wheat and oil travel on cp and cnr rails.  oil and gas through enb.  and it‚Äôs the canadian financials that all the money will flow through(though canadian financials have lost big this week i believe) .  i live in victoria and if i go to the beach i will see more ships on the water then i‚Äôve ever seen in my life.  all full of coal and grains for asia.  go to vancouver and there are containerships as far as the eye can see(long seaspan/atco).  i personally think blk is a legendary company that will be unbothered by any short term shakeups.  that‚Äôs said 630p is a good play if you‚Äôre a bear.  i guess your play is that recession hits and blk is hit by drawdowns and sentiment.  i just disagree because the us job market is very healthy and the consumer was consuming till very recently.  i think the recession starts now, but i don‚Äôt think panic and sentiment will hit until the recession is official in october.  which means you‚Äôre early.    and in options, early is broke.  plz post loss porn in april.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/hzjpo7o/)

1646684400,"&gt;who even are these antisocial shut-ins you're calling out other than maybe disabled people

lol, i was on this sub two years ago when the sight of people on the beach in florida set people off into a frenzy.  

&gt;it's clear that most people don't want to return to the office either because of the commute or factors related to the office itself that they don't like

i don't understand the purpose of you explaining something to me after i just stated the following:  *commuting sucks. paying tolls and train tickets suck. none of this is deniable.*

do you disagree with any of the following conclusions?

* wfh is a game changer and a positive benefit to nearly every individual that was afforded the opportunity to do so.  at the individual level it was a slam dunk.
* when fewer people from outside the city (commuters and tourists) spend less in the city, that will have a negative economic impact.
* the city is incentivized to push for return to office for this reason.
* there are coherent reasons for wanting people back to work beyond just doing it for real estate developers or wall street.
* upscale professionals that work in tech, finance or jobs that can thrive in a virtual environment are more immune to the negative consequences than restaurant workers, cab drivers, teachers and others who can't.  
* rich business owners came out of covid *wealthier* then they went into it.  goldman sachs, jpm stock are worth more *now* than before covid.  demonstrating that return to office isn't exactly about making wall street - they can get rich in any work environment.

if you can't even conceive of a reason why city managers would want people to return to the office without immediately resorting to ""this is all about making wall street richer"" type of arguments, then you don't get to complain about shaming or mocking people.",-1,,TheAJx,0

1646939089,"march 10 (reuters) - in the scramble by some bankers and financial industry executives to leave moscow, dubai is turning out to be a favorite location to land.  
some bankers at moscow offices of financial institutions such as jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n), rothschild &amp; co and goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) have either left or are considering moving, as operating in russia becomes increasingly difficult, several sources familiar with the matter said.

employees in russia worry that they could get caught in the middle of rising tensions between moscow and the west, sources said.  
it was unclear exactly how many bankers have left moscow since russia invaded ukraine on feb. 24 and how long they might stay abroad.  
around half of goldman sachs employees in moscow have moved or are in the process of moving to dubai, sources familiar with the matter said. the bank had around 80 staff in moscow.  
bloomberg previously reported some goldman bankers were moving to dubai. read more  
a handful of jpmorgan bankers from moscow are in dubai, but the bank did not have a formal relocation program, a source familiar with the matter said. jpmorgan has about 160 staff in moscow.  
one dubai-based banker at a separate international bank said the firm had relocated about four people from moscow to dubai, and a few more were coming in the next few days.  
separately, two sources familiar with the situation said rothschild is considering moving bankers from russia, and one of the options being considered was dubai. rothschild declined comment.  
while dubai has emerged as a favored destination for many of these people, the sources said, one of the sources said other destinations for departing bankers included turkey.  
""there's no particular playbook,"" said one of the sources, a moscow-based financial industry professional now in dubai, when asked how long people were planning on staying.

lviv, ukraine/antalya, turkey, march 10 (reuters) - talks between ukraine and russia's foreign ministers on thursday failed to bring any respite in the conflict as hundreds of thousands of civilians remained trapped in ukrainian cities sheltering from russian air raids and shelling.  
with russian president vladimir putin's war in ukraine entering its third week, officials in mariupol said russian warplanes again bombed the southern port city where a maternity hospital was pulverised on wednesday.  
putin, facing global condemnation for the assault and increasingly isolated, said russia would emerge stronger after overcoming the difficulties caused by economic sanctions.  
he told a government meeting there had been no alternative to what russia calls its special military operation in ukraine.  
""there are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them,"" he said.  
however, the invasion has so far failed to reach its stated objectives but has caused thousands of deaths and forced more than two million people to flee the country, while several cities are under siege.  
the british government blacklisted more russian oligarchs on thursday, including britain's best-known, roman abramovich, owner of chelsea soccer team.  
no breakthrough  
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ukraine's dmytro kuleba met in turkey in the highest-level talks since putin ordered the invasion on feb. 24.  
kuleba said afterwards that lavrov had refused to promise to hold fire to allow for the distribution of aid and for the evacuation along humanitarian corridors of hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in mariupol and elsewhere.  
lavrov showed no sign of making any concessions, saying the operation was going to plan and repeating moscow's accusations that ukraine posed a threat to russia.  
a ceasefire was not meant to be on the agenda at thursday's talks in antalya, lavrov added.  
aid agencies say humanitarian help is most urgently needed in mariupol, where residents are running out of food, water and power. its capture would allow russia to link up pro-moscow enclaves in the east and russian-annexed crimea to the south.  
attempts to send aid and evacuation convoys have failed for six days.  
russian warplanes targeted convoy routes on thursday, said petro andrushenko, an adviser to mariupol's mayor.  
""air strikes started from the early morning. air strike after air strike. all the historic centre is under bombardment,"" he told reuters by phone.  
""they want to absolutely delete our city, delete our people. they want to stop any evacuation.""  
lavrov said the hospital struck on wednesday had stopped treating patients and had been occupied by ukrainian ""radicals"".  
russia's defence ministry later denied having bombed the hospital, accusing ukraine of a ""staged provocation"" there.  
in brussels, european commission president ursula von der leyen said the hospital attack could constitute a war crime and should be investigated, calling it ""inhumane, cruel and tragic"".  
lavrov accused western countries of inflaming the situation by arming ukraine.  
asked if the conflict could lead to nuclear war, he said: ""i don't want to believe, and i do not believe, that a nuclear war could start.""  
russia says its offensive is aimed at disarming its neighbour and dislodging leaders it calls neo-nazis. kyiv and its western allies say this is a baseless pretext to invade a democratic country of 44 million people.  
but so far russian forces have failed to crush ukraine's military, while zelenskiy - still in the capital kyiv - has rallied his people and western military aid has poured across the polish and romanian borders.  
russian troops have advanced in the south but have yet to capture a city in the north or east. western countries believe that after a planned lightning strike on kyiv failed in the early days of the war, moscow has turned to tactics involving far more destructive assaults.  
britain said on thursday a russian column northwest of kyiv had made little progress in over a week and was suffering losses.  
in washington, cia (central intelligence agency) director william burns said putin did not appear to have a ""sustainable"" end-game in ukraine and might soon try to find a way to end the fighting.  
meanwhile, the western-led sanctions designed to cut off the russian economy and government from international markets have bitten hard, with the rouble plunging. read more  
goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) said on thursday it was closing its russian business - the first major u.s. bank to exit. it follows decisions by such emblematic global brands as mcdonald's, starbucks and coca-cola to halt business in russia.  
'barbaric'  
the pounding of mariupol underscored u.s. warnings that the biggest assault on a european state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after russia's early setbacks.  
russia has repeatedly pledged since saturday to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape mariupol. both sides have blamed the other for the failure of the evacuations.  
half of the more than 2 million total refugees from ukraine are children. the international committee of the red cross said houses had been destroyed all across ukraine.  
survivors of the worst-hit cities are among the refugees, many suffering physical injuries and psychological trauma.  
at the polish border, valera, a carpenter in his 50s, looked on nervously as his daughter anna, 24, was borne on a stretcher.  
it was two days since they had left the eastern city of kharkiv, where anna, who has cerebral palsy, broke her leg as they ran to a bomb shelter.  
""there is positional fighting during the day, air raids in the evenings, they are shelling from everything, fighter aircraft,"" he said. ""the centre (of kharkiv) is ruined, the outskirts have already been bombed.""  
he was one of few men to cross from ukraine as those of conscription age are generally obliged to stay.  
zelenskiy's chief economic adviser said russian forces had so far destroyed at least $100 billion worth of ukrainian infrastructure, buildings and other physical assets.  
the war has caused 50% of ukrainian businesses to shut down completely, while the other half are operating at well below capacity, oleg ustenko told an online event.",3,,egeym,0

i'm still not sure how the crypto regulation is going to go, but it's hard for me to imagine they would be able to stop the use of all other cryptos without intense backlash from the public and blockchain developers, or how the gov would go about enforcing regulations.

my main question is: what should we do to resist this regulation, and how to send the message that ""decentralization is what the people need and it's here to stay"". should we specifically boycott these cryptos causing them to crash?

1647388099,"march 15 (reuters) - global commodities trader trafigura group has been holding talks with private equity groups to secure additional financing as soaring prices trigger margin calls across the commodities industry, bloomberg news reported on tuesday.

trafigura faced margin calls in the billions of dollars last week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

the increased margin calls ‚Äì essentially requests to deposit extra funds with brokers ‚Äì come amid supercharged volatility in raw materials prices after the invasion of ukraine by commodities-export giant russia sparked sanctions from the united states and it allies.

trafigura had held talks with blackstone inc (bx.n) for an investment of around $2 billion to $3 billion in preference shares or a similar hybrid instrument, the report said, adding that the talks, however, failed and no deal was made.

blackstone declined a reuters request for comment.

the report also said trafigura approached apollo global management inc (apo.n), blackrock inc (blk.n) and kkr &amp; co (kkr.n) to seek new funding.

""as part of a longer-term strategy to diversify our sources of finance, we have been building relationships with alternative providers of capital,"" trafigura said in an emailed statement to reuters. ""we regularly engage with alternative capital providers on debt and equity opportunities across the business.""

apollo, kkr and blackrock also declined to comment.

earlier this month, trafigura said it raised a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from a consortium of banks to increase its financing pool in order to handle soaring energy and commodity prices.",22,,--GrinAndBearIt--,0

1647536195,"marriage laws tend to protect someone, especially after a long marriage and with kids.  they are allowed to 
 maintain a certain lifestyle

the fact that they founded amazon after they were married makes it next to impossible to say it was his from the beginning.  even if they could argue some of the seed capital/money wasn't hers (say from his parents or from his executive job before they were married) she's still entitled to a big fraction of what was gained, which, in the case of amazon is basically all of it.  

i'm sort of surprised she didn't get more, but i bet there were concerns about what that would to do amazon stock, and they might have an agreement in place that a certain amount of their money must go to their children together or the like.  

bill and melinda gates are different because billg founded msft before he met melinda french (and in fact she was a ms employee).  even there though, she got close to half, because whatever contract they had at the beginning entitles her to a big share of whatever has appreciated or gained in value since they married.  i wouldn't be surprised if some of that is because they sold ms stock (at which point any new gains were joint) or something like that.  

being rich doesn't mean you can completely screw over a spouse, and most celebrity or big business marriage contracts establish how the poorer party is protected in a divorce.",3,,sir_sri,0

blackrock inc's (blk.n) chief executive, larry fink, said on thursday that the russia-ukraine war could end up accelerating digital currencies as a tool to settle international transactions, as the conflict upends the globalization drive of the last three decades.

in a letter to the shareholders of the world's largest asset manager, fink said the war will push countries to reassess currency dependencies, and that blackrock was studying digital currencies and stablecoins due to increased client interest.

""a global digital payment system, thoughtfully designed, can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption"", he said.

that appeared to strike a different tone from may of last year, when fink raised some concerns around volatility and said it was too early to determine whether cryptocurrencies were just a speculative trading tool. read more

in the letter on thursday, the chairman and ceo of the $10 trillion asset manager said the russia-ukraine crisis had put an end to the globalization forces at work over the past 30 years.

access to global capital markets was a ""privilege, not a right,"" he said, adding blackrock had suspended the purchase of any russian securities in its active index portfolios following moscow's invasion of ukraine.

""over the past few weeks, i‚Äôve spoken to countless stakeholders, including our clients and employees, who are all looking to understand what could be done to prevent capital from being deployed to russia. we believe this is the definition of our fiduciary duty,"" fink said.

blackrock inc's total client exposure to russia had declined to less than $1 billion earlier this month from $18 billion before moscow's invasion of ukraine led to western sanctions and the closure of the russian stock market, according to figures supplied by the asset manager this month. read more

russia calls its actions in ukraine a ‚Äúspecial operation.‚Äù

the conflict's impact on global supply chains - already hammered over the past two years because of the coronavirus crisis - is expected to contribute to inflationary pressures that are pushing global central banks to tighten monetary policies and reverse covid-19-driven accommodative measures.

""while companies‚Äô and consumers‚Äô balance sheets are strong today, giving them more of a cushion to weather these difficulties, a large-scale reorientation of supply chains will inherently be inflationary,"" said fink.

he said central banks were dealing with a dilemma they had not faced in decades, having to choose between living with high inflation or slowing economic activity to contain price pressures.

energy prices have jumped as sanctions on moscow prompted companies and countries to reassess supply chains and to try to reduce dependence on russian commodities.

""energy security has joined the energy transition as a top global priority,"" fink said.",2,,Jxntb733,0

surely, ruble took a hit and lost around 30% in value; however what's more important is russian attempts to counter fallout from sanctions made ruble a non-convertible currency, with a domestic black market that is emerging right now. so official exchange rate isn't indicative anymore, since you can't freely sell rubles.",12,,pprima,0

[tl;dr this looks bad for all stocks.  every time the stock market is in a precarious situation, there is one stock that becomes more important to watch in the financial sector than almost anything else,¬†goldman sachs.  this is because as a securities firm its business is more leveraged to the performance of stocks and the economy than any other stock.   technically, goldman is a bank holding company reorganized in 2008 so it can get instantaneous lifelines from the fed in times of need (the type of lifelines that were not forthcoming for lehman brothers at the time). in practice, it's more leveraged to capital markets than any other bank.  the goldman sachs indicator relative to the s&amp;p 500 spdr is pointing down, which means that gs stock is weaker than the overall market.   that happens when investors are not bullish on the business prospects of securities firms that depend on capital markets revenues.](/r/stockmarket/comments/tpkdyw/goldman_sachs_position_indicator_showing_extreme/i2bo509/)

[i started out at 18 in 1976 when i joined the us army and the drill sergeants (forced) strongly encouraged us to buy us savings bonds every month. a $100 savings bond cost $50, and matured sometimes in the future.   after i got out in 1979 i became a police officer in a major city in the southwest, didn‚Äôt pay social security because that city and state had a government employee retirement plan i paid into every paycheck.  in the mid 80‚Äôs i went back into the army to fly helicopters and did that until 2006 when i retired and started getting a retirement check every month. i went back to buying savings bonds, but got tired of having to sign every one of them. i used that money to make down payments on houses at my retirement i had 5 rental properties, because i always bought a house when i got stationed somewhere in the states.  in the late 90‚Äôs i stopped the savings bonds purchases and got an ira, putting $150.00 a month into it. i continued putting money in there from my retirement check until about 2 months ago.  after retirement i continued flying helicopters for the army as a contractor, where i started contributing to a 401k. in 2014 i stopped working as a contractor and took a position with the fed government as a gs employee with oversight of government contracts overseas, specifically in iraq, kuwait, and afghanistan.  my 401k‚Äôs rolled over into ira‚Äôs which i still have today. my government job had the thrift savings plan (tsp) which i maxed out and contributed 20% of every paycheck, which was 26 paychecks a year.  those accounts grew over the years as the markets grew, sometimes the growth wasn‚Äôt as good as the previous year.  i totally retired in 2020 after i turned 62, i had approximately $500,000.00. in all my accounts.  my retirement house i bought in 2006 for $300,000.00 is now valued at $675,000.00, i still owe about $85,000.00 on it. i will have it paid off later this year.  i have a wife and three kids, the oldest is married and has given us 3 grandchildren. my other two are adults, but not married. i‚Äôve paid off my oldest daughter‚Äôs student loan that i co-signed for her to go to nursing school, she married a doctor and has the grandchildren.  my other two i‚Äôve financed some of their university bills, they got scholarships for most of those expenses. my youngest daughter decided she wanted to be a pilot, but they don‚Äôt give student loans for that so i totally funded her flight portion which cost approximately $70,000.00 to get her all the certification required to become an instructor and build her hours. my middle child (son) didn‚Äôt finish the university but has a great job as a software guru. i bought vehicles for all three over the years.  my wife drives a 2019 mercedes which is paid off. she‚Äôs always had a brand new vehicle while i bought a good used one for myself. i finally bought a brand new 2018 f-150 which i still have and is paid off. i recently bought a 2021 f-150 for myself and still owe $60,000.00 on it. i‚Äôm not sure if i will pay it off soon as i have 0% interest in the payments.  our two monthly payments are the mortgage and my truck. i‚Äôm about to sell the 2018 f-150 to my son and use that money to pay down the 2021 f-150.  wy son was born in 1994 and since his birth my wife has been a stay at home mother. she was a flight attendant with a large airline but decided she‚Äôd rather be a mom so we‚Äôve lived off my income only.  we‚Äôve made adjustments over the years, living within our means, never failed to pay the bills or have food on the table or a nice roof over our heads. we‚Äôve refinanced the mortgage to get lower rates, but i will have the $300,000.00 mortgage paid off before we hit the 17th year of living in this house (the longest time i‚Äôve ever lived in one house my whole life).  i‚Äôve been very fortunate, never had to borrow money from my parents and have been on my own since i was 17. i‚Äôve had the ability to do the two jobs that i always wanted since i was young‚Ä¶i‚Äôve been a cop and a pilot, both achievements happened before i got a bachelors degree, only a high school diploma.  btw i still have approximately $275,000.00 in my rollover ira‚Äôs‚Ä¶](/r/stocks/comments/tppm9o/investors_who_started_in_their_30s_where_are_you/i2di3h6/)

[a fine stock indeed friend. i bought 5k of google stock for my wife in her roth ira back in the day. after the split that stock is now worth over 140k. all tax free! that was a lucky pick. no option, no short or long, just buy and hold a good company. apple is a great pick, but i would not want one stock as a huge part of my portfolio. i have held mo and xom as over 10% positions - and did very well with both - but i sold half of each position after a made my target profit (33%) in a short period and repositioned the capital so the profit was realized and diversified. i am no investing genius but i have been fortunate. i want to retire comfortably and since i am closing in on 50 i need to be smart. fingers crossed i can take my capital and get it to double before i am 60, then with a state pension and real estate i can retire comfortably, take my family on vacations and, someday, spoil my grandchildren! while is a long way off since my kid is only 13‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ lol.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/towhmt/oc_warren_buffetts_2022_portfolio_update_at/i2bzg5p/)

[i think tesla is a good stock, that doesn't mean it's justified in price. it's just the nature of the stock itself. but i think nio will give a better roi in terms of % gain in 2022 because of the catalysts despite being chinese, which shouldn't be an issue, to begin with if we consider geopolitics, economics, and the likelihood of what china bears suggest ""could"" happen.  i think gme has a possibility for a ""short- squeeze"" more likely than amc which i never see happening. i think nasdaq stocks, growth, spec, will have their time along with chinese stocks. this is based around cooperation between the positive news around the chinese securities and exchange commission and the u.s., but that didn't matter to me personally. because i always weighed probabilities more on macroeconomics, geopolitics, economics, and trends, because the data tends to show a more realistic outcome than narratives being pushed.  i'm more concerned if americans are able to tolerate watching their retirement portfolios drop 10-40% and what it does to their overall wellbeing. so i think the fed/government are in an interesting place where they need inflation. i think the fed/government are very smart and are assets will keep rising over the long run, but short-term pain is necessary for long-term outcomes that promote social stability.](/r/stocks/comments/tpwzun/the_nasdaq_is_up_358_points_this_week_what_are/i2e77eg/)

[investing in a stock simply because it's going up is a terrible way to pick stocks. it's a newbie mistake and it's really easy for smart money to play the (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp). this is why i personally am building a large position in chinese adrs - because i think they're undervalued. i don't see a fundamental reason - other than fear - why a majority of these stocks are at 3-5 year lows. they're absolutely rock bottom price - from a value investing perspective.  that's why you need to focus on what exactly your investment strategy and perspective is. for individual stocks, i'm a value investor. for etfs i'm a growth person. i figure it all balances out my portfolio overall.  so, what kind of investor are you? speculative? value? growth? it's not binary either - there's nothing wrong with choosing a mixture of each. so, if you want stay with nkla - fine. but, don't put in more than you're willing to lose.  edit: i have a mix of these three strategies with my chinese adr. i'm speculative into tal and edu. value i'm baba and pdd. growth i'm rere and nio.](/r/stocks/comments/tq1dq5/is_nkla_something_i_should_just_hold_and_see/i2en5vz/)

[i think a lot of times when investing in speculative growth companies, people oftentimes don't actually create 10 possible scenarios and the likelihood of each outcome. marijuana stocks were something i avoided because there was too much-unacknowledged competition.   i've held stocks for 5 years or more such as tesla and now nio for give or take around 3 years. i do think you can actively trade companies you believe in, but i don't think taking a loss is a bad thing if you see a better opportunity elsewhere. the only company i've held where i have been down is a biotech company, but i knew over time it would do better, which it did. i was also down on uxin from my initial investment which i held for almost a year and averaged down in. but the only reason why i held was because i knew it would just take time and i saw paths towards positive outcomes. i have taken losses on some companies because i saw better opportunities elsewhere and didn't see any possible turnaround for the company, and i do enjoy turnaround plays. for luckin coffee i bought in the 20s? or 30s? sold in the 40s-50s? i forget, but then i bought around 5, it went much lower, i held, it turned out well. but that's because i knew it was just a matter of time. market psychology and the intelligent investor are good books, having time on your hand and tolerance is also a good thing too. markets are cyclical so be mindful of that, but yeah i don't know about marijuana stocks. stayed away just because i know too many people who grow their own weed. the prices from retailers are high as well so i just avoided it and even avoided considering viewing the financials.](/r/stocks/comments/tpcfjn/what_has_been_the_longest_amount_of_time_you_held/i2e6fdl/)

[i started out at 18 in 1976 when i joined the us army and the drill sergeants (forced) strongly encouraged us to buy us savings bonds every month. a $100 savings bond cost $50, and matured sometimes in the future.   after i got out in 1979 i became a police officer in a major city in the southwest, didn‚Äôt pay social security because that city and state had a government employee retirement plan i paid into every paycheck.  in the mid 80‚Äôs i went back into the army to fly helicopters and did that until 2006 when i retired and started getting a retirement check every month. i went back to buying savings bonds, but got tired of having to sign every one of them. i used that money to make down payments on houses at my retirement i had 5 rental properties, because i always bought a house when i got stationed somewhere in the states.  in the late 90‚Äôs i stopped the savings bonds purchases and got an ira, putting $150.00 a month into it. i continued putting money in there from my retirement check until about 2 months ago.  after retirement i continued flying helicopters for the army as a contractor, where i started contributing to a 401k. in 2014 i stopped working as a contractor and took a position with the fed government as a gs employee with oversight of government contracts overseas, specifically in iraq, kuwait, and afghanistan.  my 401k‚Äôs rolled over into ira‚Äôs which i still have today. my government job had the thrift savings plan (tsp) which i maxed out and contributed 20% of every paycheck, which was 26 paychecks a year.  those accounts grew over the years as the markets grew, sometimes the growth wasn‚Äôt as good as the previous year.  i totally retired in 2020 after i turned 62, i had approximately $500,000.00. in all my accounts.  my retirement house i bought in 2006 for $300,000.00 is now valued at $675,000.00, i still owe about $85,000.00 on it. i will have it paid off later this year.  i have a wife and three kids, the oldest is married and has given us 3 grandchildren. my other two are adults, but not married. i‚Äôve paid off my oldest daughter‚Äôs student loan that i co-signed for her to go to nursing school, she married a doctor and has the grandchildren.  my other two i‚Äôve financed some of their university bills, they got scholarships for most of those expenses. my youngest daughter decided she wanted to be a pilot, but they don‚Äôt give student loans for that so i totally funded her flight portion which cost approximately $70,000.00 to get her all the certification required to become an instructor and build her hours. my middle child (son) didn‚Äôt finish the university but has a great job as a software guru. i bought vehicles for all three over the years.  my wife drives a 2019 mercedes which is paid off. she‚Äôs always had a brand new vehicle while i bought a good used one for myself. i finally bought a brand new 2018 f-150 which i still have and is paid off. i recently bought a 2021 f-150 for myself and still owe $60,000.00 on it. i‚Äôm not sure if i will pay it off soon as i have 0% interest in the payments.  our two monthly payments are the mortgage and my truck. i‚Äôm about to sell the 2018 f-150 to my son and use that money to pay down the 2021 f-150.  wy son was born in 1994 and since his birth my wife has been a stay at home mother. she was a flight attendant with a large airline but decided she‚Äôd rather be a mom so we‚Äôve lived off my income only.  we‚Äôve made adjustments over the years, living within our means, never failed to pay the bills or have food on the table or a nice roof over our heads. we‚Äôve refinanced the mortgage to get lower rates, but i will have the $300,000.00 mortgage paid off before we hit the 17th year of living in this house (the longest time i‚Äôve ever lived in one house my whole life).  i‚Äôve been very fortunate, never had to borrow money from my parents and have been on my own since i was 17. i‚Äôve had the ability to do the two jobs that i always wanted since i was young‚Ä¶i‚Äôve been a cop and a pilot, both achievements happened before i got a bachelors degree, only a high school diploma.  btw i still have approximately $275,000.00 in my rollover ira‚Äôs‚Ä¶](/r/stocks/comments/tppm9o/investors_who_started_in_their_30s_where_are_you/i2di3h6/)
