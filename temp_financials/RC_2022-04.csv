1649079707,"new york, april 4 (reuters) - jpmorgan (jpm.n) boss jamie dimon warned on monday that the bank could lose about $1 billion on its russia exposure, the first time it has detailed the extent of its potential losses resulting from the conflict in ukraine.

in his keenly watched annual letter to shareholders, the chairman and chief executive of the biggest u.s. bank by assets also urged the united states to increase its military presence in europe and reiterated a call for it to develop a plan to ensure energy security for itself and its allies.

dimon did not provide details on jpmorgan's potential loss number or a time frame but said the bank was concerned about the secondary impact of russia's invasion of ukraine on companies and countries. russia calls its actions a ""special operation.""

global banks have detailed their exposure to russia in recent weeks but dimon is the most high-profile world business leader yet to comment on the broader impact of the conflict.

""america must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in ukraine with unpredictable outcomes. we should prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"" he wrote. (for five key takeaways from dimon's letter, click on read more )

dimon addressed the relationship between the united states and china and said the united states should revamp its supply chain to restrict its scope to suppliers within the united states or to only include ""completely friendly allies"". he urged the united states to rejoin the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), one of the world's biggest multinational trade deals.

commenting on the macroeconomic environment, dimon said the number of federal reserve interest rate hikes ""could be significantly higher than the market expects."" he also detailed the bank's rising expenses, in part due to technology investments and acquisition costs.

the letter is dimon's 17th as ceo. while dimon is not the only ceo of a top u.s. bank to write such letters, his have become must-reads among wall street's elite and policymakers for the view they provide into his political and economic ideas.

'fortress balance sheet'

this year's letter comes as the russia-ukraine war and high inflation are hurting the economy, and as dimon faces new skepticism from investors over expenses.

some question his plans to increase spending on the bank's information technology and campaigns to take market share in businesses and geographies where jpmorgan currently trails competitors, such as in germany and the united kingdom.

jpmorgan decided earlier this year to hold its first investor day since the pandemic began to address doubts about its spending plans. the meeting will be held on may 23.

dimon has spent more than a decade building what he calls the bank's ""fortress balance sheet,"" and he said it is now robust enough that jpmorgan could withstand losses of $10 billion or more and ""still be in very good shape.""

while dimon wrote that he is not worried about the bank's exposure to russia, he said the war in ukraine will slow the global economy and will impact geopolitics for decades.

""we are facing challenges at every turn: a pandemic, unprecedented government actions, a strong recovery after a sharp and deep global recession, a highly polarized u.s. election, mounting inflation, a war in ukraine and dramatic economic sanctions against russia,"" he said.

on acquisitions, dimon said that the bank will be reducing stock buybacks over the next year to meet capital increases required by federal rules ""and because we have made some good acquisitions that we believe will enhance the future of our company.""

jpmorgan has been on a buying spree, spending nearly $5 billion on acquisitions over the past 18 months. dimon said that will increase ""incremental investment expenses"" by roughly $700 million this year.

investments in technology will add $2 billion to expenses this year, dimon said.",22,,solcon,0

1649256024,"london, april 6 (reuters) - **russia edged closer to a potential default on its international debt on wednesday as it paid dollar bondholders in roubles and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves are blocked by sanctions.**  
  
the united states on monday stopped russia from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at u.s. banks, saying moscow had to choose between draining its dollar reserves and default. read more  
  
russia has not defaulted on its external debt since reneging on payments due after the 1917 bolshevik revolution.  
  
""this speeds up the timeline around when russia runs out of space on willingness and ability to pay,"" one fund manager holding one of the bonds due for payment on monday said.  
  
the kremlin said it would continue to pay its dues.  
  
""russia has all necessary resources to service its debts... if this blockade continues and payments aimed for servicing debts are blocked, it (future payment) could be made in roubles,"" kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said.  
  
with a total of 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding, moscow has managed to make a number of foreign exchange coupon payments on its eurobonds before the united states stopped such transactions. read more  
  
russia's finance ministry said on wednesday it had to pay roubles to holders of its dollar-denominated eurobonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 as a foreign bank had refused to process an order to pay $649 million to holders of its sovereign debt.  
  
the finance ministry said the foreign bank, which it did not name, rejected russia's order to pay coupons on the two bonds and also did not process payment of a eurobond maturing in 2022.  
  
russia's ability to fulfil its debt obligations is in focus after sweeping sanctions in response to what moscow calls ""a special military operation"" in ukraine have frozen nearly half of its reserves and limited access to global payment systems.  
  
'artificial situation'  
  
jp morgan, which had been processing payments on russian sovereign bonds as a correspondent bank, was stopped by the u.s. treasury from doing for the two payments due on monday, a source familiar with the situation said. read more  
  
jp morgan (jpm.n) declined to comment.  
  
russia may consider allowing foreign holders of its 2022 and 2042 eurobonds to convert rouble payments into foreign currencies once access to its forex accounts is restored, the finance ministry said.  
  
until then, a rouble equivalent of eurobond payments aimed at bondholders from so-called unfriendly nations will be kept in special 'c' type accounts at russia's national settlement depository, the ministry added.  
  
russia has a 30-day grace period to make the dollar payment, but if the cash does not show up in bondholders account within that time frame it would constitute a default, global rating agencies have said.  
  
russia dismissed this as being a default situation.  
  
""in theory, a default situation could be created but this would be a purely artificial situation,"" peskov said. ""there are no grounds for a real default.""  
  
bondholders had been tracking bond payments since sweeping sanctions and counter measures from moscow which have severed russia from the global financial system.  
  
russia on wednesday paid coupons on four ofz treasury rouble bonds. these were once popular for their high yields among foreign investors, who are now blocked from receiving payments as a result of sanctions and russian retaliation.",5,,baaawbag,0

i can't stress this enough, no matter how often i mention it anywhere on reddit.


i like calling it 'de-brainwashing the windows system', as ms has so much useless shit built into it nowadays.

if you're tech-savvy enough, use something like [w10privacy](https://www.w10privacy.de/english-home/), a fully-fledged and extremely powerful program designed to give you a variety of controls on how windows 10 behaves, especially on how often it's calling home to ms. it's particularly useful for removing software that otherwise can't really be removed (onedrive, cortana, etc). be careful though, as this program can easily break your system if you don't know what you're doing. 

if the above mentioned sounds too frightening to you, then at least remove all the programs you don't need. press win + r, type 'control' and navigate to &gt; 'programs' &gt; 'uninstall a program'. if you're an at least moderately sane human being that likes to have control over the software it uses, you're not going to need the ms stock apps.

video/music player? go for vlc or mpv instead. 

remove the default photo app, go for something like imageglass.

who uses edge anyway. use firefox and get some good extensions going, e.g. ublock origin, https everywhere and decentraleyes.

get an ad-free yt player like freetube.

go for a neat pdf reader like sumatrapdf.

and last but not least, install software that cares for your computer. that thing needs love, day by day. check the temps regularly with coretemp, undervolt using throttlestop if necessary. keep all your drivers up to date with snappydriverinstaller origin.

1649467555,"‚Äúwashington, april 8 (reuters breakingviews) - a decade after goldman sachs (gs.n) helped 1mdb raise billions of dollars, one of its former employees has been brought to justice for the fraud. a u.s. jury on friday found banker roger ng read more guilty in the $4.5 billion bribery plot involving malaysia‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund. but his ex-boss, who played a bigger role, may get a lesser penalty while the wall street firm got off with $5 billion in fines. it‚Äôs only a partial redress.

the 1mdb scandal, one of the biggest cases of overseas corruption, ensnared top government and bank officials alike. goldman raised $6.5 billion for 1mdb through bond sales, receiving $600 million for its services. about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund and allegedly doled out to government officials, including ex-malaysian prime minister najib razak, spent on items including a super-yacht and financing ‚Äúthe wolf of wall street‚Äù.

yet ng, goldman‚Äôs former top banker in malaysia, will likely be the only one who faces judgment in an american court. he was accused of receiving $35 million in illicit funds and faces a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for three counts of conspiring to launder money and violating anti-corruption laws.

ng was accused of receiving $35 million in illegal kickbacks and helping his ex-boss, tim leissner, embezzle money and bribe officials as part of $4.5 billion that was misappropriated from 1mdb and diverted to government officials, bankers and others. ng pleaded not guilty.

others who played bigger roles in the scheme face lighter penalties. tim leissner, goldman‚Äôs former chairman in southeast asia, testified against ng, saying the pair lied to bank executives and others to hide the kickbacks, including the involvement of malaysian financier jho low, the only other person charged by the united states. leissner, who pleaded guilty in 2018 and forfeited $44 million, faces one less charge than ng and could receive leniency for his assistance. low is still a fugitive.‚Äù

             so recap:    billions and billions in bribes......and the poor sguy who got allegedly $35 millions....gets the 30 years sentence!

noh, with merrill lynch since 2000, co-founded merrill‚Äôs distressed debt group in hong kong, the statement said.

it said noh, who started his career as an accountant, also worked for goldman sachs gs.n and morgan stanley ms.n in hong kong and korea, respectively.

**patrick edsparr**

his appointment comes a month after citadel hired jpmorgan's fixed-income chief, patrick edsparr, as chief executive for citadel europe and head of global fixed-income. timing of that move ruffled feathers with jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon because it played out while the bank was putting together an emergency takeover of bear stearns, the new york post reports

**lawsuit**

the sow provided that bcg would be compensated on the greater of a fixed fee, or a variable fee based upon projected profit improvement. bcg‚Äôs variable fee was not predetermined or capped as to the vast majority of the workstreams. rather, with one limited exception, which gamestop specifically negotiated, bcg‚Äôs compensation was tied directly to the anticipated profit improvements resulting from its work (i.e., the best possible estimate of each initiative‚Äôs expected impact at the time the decision to launch such initiative was made). in other words, bcg‚Äôs variable fees were based upon projections, not actual profit improvements. indeed, the sow provided that even 2019 profit improvements, and bcg‚Äôs resulting fee, were based upon projections.

**world health organization**

an unnamed consulting company, which vox has identified as bcg, charged the world health organization $11.72 million since the start of the pandemic for contracts that were dubiously awarded, according to the audit.

these revelations, which one expert called ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù in an interview with vox, came after a vox investigation showed how management consulting firms such as bcg and mckinsey have become ubiquitous in global public health organizations, despite the concerns of many health practitioners about multimillion-dollar price tags, potential conflicts of interest, and the opaque nature of consulting work.

1649864342,"with all due respect to members of the fed, they are bubble dwellers.  read their bios‚Ä¶not a ny minute of work experience outside of economics/gov economics.

the banks are reporting and i‚Äôm paying attention to credit losses.  for the past two years, the pop tune was ‚Äúhouseholds are flush &amp; i feel fine.‚Äù   

this morning jpm-chase reported higher credit losses &amp; a slow down in deal making.  i expected the slow down in deal flow because $evr‚Äôs stock price reflects the sentiment.  i expected higher credit losses but with a question mark.  think i can remove the question mark‚Ä¶from reuters, an excerpt:

‚Äú*april 13 (reuters) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co's (jpm.n) first-quarter profit slumped 42% as dealmaking slowed and credit losses increased, with chief executive jamie dimon warning that decades-high inflation and the ukraine crisis could dampen economic growth.*  
*the lackluster results from the largest u.s. lender - seen as a bellwether for the economy - set the tone for first-quarter earnings from wall street banks as the federal reserve looks to rein in inflation and the trading bonanza the banks enjoyed during the pandemic tapers off.*

party ended some time ago.  borrowers aren‚Äôt in as good as shape as the pop narrative of the day would have us believe.  as for the \*trading bonanza\*‚Ä¶.oh, now it‚Äôs bad?  is it time to cue up the greedy banker meme?  as we‚Äôre already seeing, the greedy big oil price gouging meme is out‚Äîdusted that off from 2008, 2014.

and dimon has already foreshadowed another fav meme by hinting we need more combat boots on the ground in nato countries.  when consumers are hurting because of policy mistakes, the narrative map becomes clear:  attack big banking, big oil, and some foreign bad guy.  


will ignore most of the news but will be paying close attention to the banking sector and credit metrics.

i‚Äôm from non target and have to market myself heavily get close to 4.0 and work while studying full time because im not at a target.

but this is because genuinely the workload at non targets are less, if you‚Äôre working hard and effectively market it and yourself.

i don‚Äôt think target means as much as what people imply here often. if you have a head on your shoulders and are looking to be interested in making your firm money and delivering tangible results consistently. communicate that in the interview and get a high paying job when you have the experience.

you just need 1-2 year of targeted strategic experience and you break that target v nontarget barrier easily imo if you can get clients, are sophisticated with financial statements, modeling, excel $ms office, earn the trust of the firms clients, and get your work done well",3,,That-Sandy-Arab,0

ukraine aid, mandate confusion, lyoya autopsy, wh restores nepa, 4/20, diamond sales, gold consolidation? shanghai lifts, silver demand

we saw a big jump late day yesterday in fangmt stocks.

ukraine: offensive has picked up, us officials says russia has sent 11 additional battalion groups (about 20k soldiers)

biden is expected to announce more military support goods/weapons

biggest confusion around new mask mandate (removal of mandate) can private business‚Äô force patrons to wear masks?

police involved shooting that took place in michigan last week, autopsy shows he was shot in the back of the head, could this lead to protests, rallies etc? look for gun stocks and body cam stocks

1650486892,"this tells me that you have no idea what you're talking about. the fact is that big money is using ta to help guide their decisions too. with millions of people using it, it literally becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

it's doesn't work 100% of the time, but nothing does. however, using ta in conjuction with your other factors taken into consideration, your trading gets a lot better when you can recognize patterns forming. 

example, i took calls on $antm today and i'm up 76%

i took calls on $tgt 2 days ago, and those suckers are printing cash like an atm machine. up over 400%

i took $hd calls today and i'm up 50% on those

my $jpm calls from two days ago are up over 100%

how did i make all those picks?  i used finviz with my screener options, filtered by volume, looked at the patterns, and made an educated decision on which ones i thought would go up based on all my parameters, plus the trends that the charts were showing. 

maybe you just don't know how to use ta effectively, and should study it more. i won't knock it, because it works for me. but you do you. if you think it's all just a tarot card reading or like astrology, then you keep thinking that. those of us that use it effectively, will continue to make money.",1,,Mr_Rivera,0

1650499037,"to answer your questions:

1) the gfc was a brutal time to invest, but it really separated the smart money from the dumb money. warren buffett made some amazing investments (like buying goldman sachs stock) and made out like bandits. most dumb investors (highly leveraged investors or those that invested in asset backed securities) just lost everything.

2) stop losses and other orders were useless. the trading circuit breakers would occasionally have to go into effect and most prices would blow right past your stop loss

3) it made me a lot more aggressive in my market timing. i had been through the dot com collapse and did very well when the nasdaq recovered, so when the gfc happened, i went on a buying spree of stocks and ended up generating huge returns over the next decade.  during the crash in march 2020, i moved nearly all my bonds and cash into equities and earned handsome 20% plus returns on the investments.

the important thing is not to use leverage as you‚Äôll be forced to delever just as markets are crashing. instead, keep some ‚Äúdry powder‚Äù and aggressively invest when people are panicking because they‚Äôre getting margin calls from their brokers. you can then sweep in and buy high quality companies at a bargain.",74,,Winnipeg_dad888,0

born in 1974, birchall was hired by musk from morgan stanley in 2016 to work for his family office. birchall is also the chief executive of musk's brain chip firm neuralink, a director at musk's tunneling firm the boring company and a board member at musk's philanthropic private foundation.

business registration records with the texas comptroller of public accounts list birchall as the manager of excession as recently as 2021.

birchall and musk did not respond to requests for comment.

[google cloud was late to the party. aws was first on the scene and they became the standard. azure is integrated with the rest of microsofts product stack so it makes sense for companies that heavily use ms products. cloud products tend to be very sticky as well. it's not trivial to switch over to a different cloud computing platform.   so the problem isn't that it's less viable, it's that they have to go find new customers that aren't already on aws or azure. or get companies to switch which isn't easy.   there are technical differences between the three as well. devs will have to decide which is better suited to their specific workload and that's a lot of technical details i don't care to explain.](/r/stocks/comments/ue517d/which_is_the_better_buy_at_these_levels_amzn_or/i6n8z6q/)
