florida&amp;#x27;s chief financial officer said on thursday his department would pull $2 billion worth of its assets managed by blackrock inc , the biggest such divestment by a state opposed to the asset manager&amp;#x27;s environmental, social and corporate governance (esg) policies.





___

dec 1 (reuters) - florida's chief financial officer said on thursday his department would pull $2 billion worth of its assets managed by blackrock inc (blk.n), the biggest such divestment by a state opposed to the asset manager's environmental, social and corporate governance (esg) policies.

the move will hardly dent blackrock's $8 trillion in assets and drew a strong response from the company, which said the action put politics over investor interests.

nonetheless it underscores how a backlash against esg investing is gathering steam among republican leaders in florida, and elsewhere, who criticize corporations for focusing on matters like climate change or workforce diversity.

republicans are set to assume control of the u.s. house of representatives in january. this will allow them to hold hearings on esg and grill company executives about their policies, and also pressure regulators to scrutinize them.

in a statement, florida cfo jimmy patronis said the state's treasury, which he oversees, would remove blackrock as manager of about $600 million of short-term investments and have its custodian freeze $1.43 billion of long-term securities now with blackrock, with an eye on reallocating the money to other money managers by the start of 2023.

patronis accused blackrock of focusing on esg rather than higher returns for investors.

""florida's treasury division is divesting from blackrock because they have openly stated they've got other goals than producing returns,"" patronis said in the statement provided by his office.

asked about the move, blackrock said in a statement: ""we are disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives like this that sacrifice access to high-quality investments and thereby jeopardize returns, which will ultimately hurt florida&amp;#146;s citizens. fiduciaries should always value performance over politics.""

neither patronis nor his office had raised any performance concerns, blackrock said, adding it has invested more than $65 billion in florida-based companies, municipal bonds and other securities.",1,,politicly1,0

1) i started my career at an opportunistic fund of funds buying illiquid ""side pocketed"" assets which the funds couldn't get liquid on fast enough to meet redemptions during the financial crisis.  now i work in private equity tech investing, so him assuming i ""haven't read a financial magazine"" is a bit more than off.


2) you can disagree with my assessment that this will cause more redemptions, but just think - who the fuck would put their money in this fund right now rather than a closed end fund selling at a discount and liquid? and if others are getting gated, many will think to try to exit before a more serious issue emerges.


3) like i said bx stock was down 7% on the news (now 8.5%), so i don't even know why this is a debate that it's a clear negative for blackstone.

new york, dec 1 (reuters) - (this dec. 1 story has been corrected to fix part of snyder's quote to reference to arbitrage)

blackstone inc (bx.n) limited withdrawals from its $69 billion unlisted real estate income trust (reit) on thursday after a surge in redemption requests, an unprecedented blow to a franchise that helped it turn into an asset management behemoth.

the curbs came because redemptions hit pre-set limits, rather than blackstone setting the limits on the day. nonetheless, they fueled investor concerns about the future of the reit, which makes up about 17% of blackstone's earnings. blackstone shares ended down 7.1% on the news on thursday. they were down a further 2% on friday morning at $83.45.

many investors in the reit are concerned that blackstone has been slow to adjust the vehicle's valuation to that of publicly traded reits that have taken a hit amid rising interest rates, a source close to the fund said. rising interest rates weigh on real estate values because they make financing properties more expensive.


blackstone has reported a 9.3% year-to-date return for its reit, net of fees, a contrast to the publicly traded dow jones u.s. select reit total return index (.dwrtft) 22.19% decline over the same period.



alex snyder, a portfolio manager at centersquare investment management llc in philadelphia, said the arbitrage between the value blackstone has assigned to its real estate portfolio and the value of publicly traded reits caught the eye of investors.


""people are taking profits at the value blackstone says their reit shares are at,"" said snyder.

a blackstone spokesperson declined to comment on how the new york-based firm calculates the valuation of its reit, but said its portfolio was concentrated in rental housing and logistics in the southern and western united states that have short duration leases and rents outpacing inflation.

report an ad
the spokesperson added that the reit relied on a long-term fixed rate debt structure, making it resilient.

""our business is built on performance, not fund flows, and performance is rock solid,"" the spokesperson said.

the reit is marketed to wealthy individual investors. two sources familiar with the matter said turmoil in asian markets, fueled by concerns about china's economic prospects and political stability, contributed to the redemptions. the majority of investors redeeming were from asia and needed the liquidity, they said.

blackstone told investors in a letter it would curb withdrawals from its reit after it received redemption requests in november greater than 2% of its monthly net asset value and 5% of its quarterly net asset value. as a result, the reit allowed investors in november to redeem $1.3 billion, equivalent to approximately 43% of investors' repurchase requests.

barclays analysts downgraded their rating of blackstone's stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight"" and cut their price target to $90 from $98 on friday. they and other analysts said blackstone's reit runs the risk of getting caught in a spiral of selling assets to meet redemptions if it cannot regain the trust of its investors. on thursday, the firm said the reit had agreed to sell its 49.9% interest in two las vegas casinos for $1.27 billion.

""the impact on blackstone depends on whether the reit is able to stabilize its net asset value over time, or is forced to enter an extended run-off scenario, with significant asset sales and ongoing redemption backlog — too early to tell, in our view,"" bmo capital markets analysts wrote in a note.

blow to blackstone's plans
the reit turmoil is a setback for two of blackstone's strategies that helped it become the world's biggest alternative asset manager with $951 billion in assets: real estate investing and attracting high net-worth individuals.

blackstone launched the reit in 2017, piggybacking off the success of its real estate empire, which had by then outgrown its private equity business. its president jonathan gray was elevated and made successor to chief executive stephen schwarzman as a result of his success in property investing.

the reit also represented a bid to win over high net-worth investors clamoring for private market products, which they believe perform better than those that are publicly traded.

blackstone has been seeking to diversify its investor base after tapping institutional investors, such as public pension funds, insurance firms and sovereign wealth funds, for its products for decades.

blackstone managed a total of $236 billion of wealth held by individuals as of the end of september, up 43% year-on-year.

credit suisse analysts wrote in a note that they expected the reit's woes to weigh on blackstone's fee-related earnings and assets under management. ""these all will continue put pressure on blackstone's premium valuation,"" they wrote.

on blackstone's third-quarter earnings call in october, gray blamed reit redemptions on market volatility, which he said had driven away individual investors from active equity and fixed income funds.

he added that the reit had ample cash reserves to ""weather pretty much any storm."" these cash reserves totaled $2.7 billion as of the end of october, according to its prospectus. blackstone also said in the prospectus it had access to $9.3 billion in ""immediate liquidity.""

""it's not a surprise that you would see a deceleration in flows from individual investors when you've had this kind of market decline,"" gray said.",3,,100milliondone,0

1670478076,"""dec 7 (reuters) - billionaire elon musk's bankers are considering providing the tesla inc (tsla.o) chief executive officer with new margin loans backed by the u.s. automaker's stock to replace some of the high interest debt on his twitter deal, bloomberg news reported on wednesday.  
  
the margin loans are one of the options that the morgan stanley (ms.n)-led bank group and musk's advisers have discussed to ease the $13 billion debt twitter took on as part of musk's $44 billion deal, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  
  
the discussions have so far centered around replacing the $3 billion of unsecured debt on which twitter pays an interest rate of 11.75%, the maximum banks had agreed to finance the acquisition in april, the report said.  
  
morgan stanley (ms.n), bank of america corp (bac.n), barclays plc (barc.l) and mitsubishi ufj financial group inc (8306.t) led the $13 billion financing for the bid by musk.  
  
tesla and morgan stanley did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.  
  
the banks are not expected to offload any of the twitter debt to institutional investors until the new year, bloomberg reported.  
  
reuters reported in october that banks had abandoned plans to sell the debt to investors because of uncertainty around twitter's fortunes and losses.  
  
musk closed the deal with $13 billion in loans from banks and a $33.5 billion equity commitment, which included his 9.6% twitter stake worth $4 billion and $7.1 billion from investors including oracle corp (orcl.n) co-founder larry ellison and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal.""",2,,Ithinkstrangely,0

1670527572," my words were harsh because it's this important.  it's not like he accidentally traded in crypto. it was a conscious decision. 

and he should have been keeping his crypto in exchange that reports back to the employer. this isn't always a requirement, but for anyone who is a manager or above it is typically required that the broker sends monthly reports so the company can verify no illegal years have occurred. (illegal being stricter for financial employees than normal people. for example, i can't lawfully buy amazon stock for 3 years because we audited an amazon affiliate.)

in many circumstances, even the appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for civil or even criminal fines. 

there is leeway of something was truly accidentally. for example, maybe you bought wells fargo stock not knowing that your company just signed a deal with wells fargo. or you forgot to declare that college saving account you setup a decade ago and since neglected. 

but trading crypto without a broker using company equipment and 3rd party hardware. that's three strikes without looking at any details.",1,,grauenwolf,0

1670609236,i really think blackstone is the ticking timebomb nobody is talking about…. $bx to 50… short blackswan,1,,DeadLightsOut,0
1670628782,"that's sort of right. the greeks aren't *based* on those things, they are solutions to equations in which time, strike, reference price etc are known parameters, and in which realised volatility has to be substituted for by implied volatility, because obviously the *realised* part of realised vol hasn't actually happened yet.

so, implied vol isn't really a supply and demand tracker exactly. it's literally the price. the premium paid is a fixed derivative\* of the implied vol, since all the other parameters in black scholes are known at the time of setting the premium. so the implied vol is the true price.

\*even this isn't quite true. when trading options in the interbank market, they are priced in vols. so as a dealer, you get asked for, say, your price for an option at a particular strike and expiry and a particular size, and you would reply 11.34 (meaning implied vol of 11.34%) for instance. i'm not 100% sure how it would in markets like equity options, where you might use the strikes on existing contracts. but in something purely otc like fx you don't even name the strike, you would say, for instance ""eurusd jan 10th 25 delta downside in 200"". because the delta is something you can solve from the other inputs. note you're not even being asked for puts, specifically. convention in many markets is to trade straddles, so that request would actually be for the straddle in 100 per leg. but even that really doesn't matter, because you're exchanging the delta anyway, so you really don't care whether it's puts, calls, straddles or whatever. you're a vol trader. you're trading the vol surface. in theory, unless you specifically want to trade the spot directionally,  you're going to be delta hedging yourself the entire time, or as close to it as is practical.

market making a book of options electronically is quite interesting in this regard - you basically publish an entire vol surface, setting the ivs for a range of deltas / strikes from atm out to say 5 delta puts and calls, across the range of expiries that you're covering. and then the surface between those points is just interpolated. and you can pick out specific dates and change the interpolation calculation, or just enter a standout iv, like if there's a big risk event like, say, fomc day next week, and you want to drag implieds higher to cover the increased risk premium.

looking at a live vol surface rendered on a screen in 3d is very helpful for understanding options markets (and once you've seen them in 3d, building a mental picture of it from just seeing the numerical implieds is a lot easier in future).

the reason i say they aren't quite a tracker of supply and demand is because, well, they *are* in the same way that any price is. but as with any price, vols being elevated doesn't necessarily mean that someone is buying vol... like in em fx, pretty much all pairs will have skew to the topside, meaning that for any usd/em fx pair, the 25 delta topside strike will be priced higher (have a higher iv, and hence cost more premium) than the 25 delta downside strike for the same date. and the opposite is true in equity options. the jan expiry 25delta $jpm puts will have a higher implied volatility than the jan expiry 25delta $jpm calls. several reasons: 1/ because moves to the downside in equities tend to be associated with higher volatility regimes, so there *should* be a skew, irrespective of demand. 2/ because there is indeed natural demand for equity downside even in bull markets, for hedging and so on. 3/ because ""excess premium capture"" is a thing that a lot of investors do to enhance returns. like, selling otm covered calls on stocks you own. so you cap your upside if the stock explodes upward through your strike, but in a normal environment you just collect a bit of premium for selling low delta topside, increasing your return profile. literally selling some of your upside exposure. which creates a natural supply of vol to the topside, which doesn't really exist as much to the downside. all the exact same dynamics produce the same effect (albeit to the topside) in usd/emfx. and of all of those, 2 and 3 are indeed ""supply and demand tracking"", but 1 isn't, really.",3,,odonnthe,0
1670640954,"&gt;big finance has lost an ally in the u.s. democratic party. senator kyrsten sinema is changing her party registration from democrat to independent, capping a years-long ideological shift by the arizona senator away from liberals and toward the political center. it may accelerate wall street’s own shift to the right.

&gt;sinema was an outlier in her support for investors and fund managers. she has raised nearly $2.7 million from the securities and investing sector since 2017, according to opensecrets data, and broke with democrats last year when they pushed to raise taxes on the wealthiest u.s. households. she was the sole democrat to vote against changing the tax treatment of carried interest in august, ensuring private equity fund managers continue to pay less on their profits than the rate charged on regular income.

&gt;the financial sector has been moving away from the political left – physically, in some cases. industry giants including goldman sachs , citadel and tiger global management shifted staff to florida during the pandemic, trading the solidly democratic government of new york for a substantially more conservative environment.

&gt;some of the biggest names on wall street have similarly tied themselves to the republican party’s leaders. former goldman sachs president and registered democrat gary cohn served as the director of the national economic council in the donald trump administration. citadel chief executive ken griffin has already said he will support florida governor ron desantis should he run for president in 2024. jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon admitted to cnbc in 2019 that ""my heart is democratic but my brain is kind of republican.""

&gt;that tension is most visible in the debate over esg investing, focused on environmental, social and governance considerations and increasingly identified with the political left. republicans in texas and florida are threatening to divert public investment away from what they see as a democratic agenda. vanguard said on wednesday it is pulling out of the net zero asset managers initiative, an industry effort to counter climate change. activist investor bluebell capital partners has criticized $8 trillion asset manager blackrock’s (blk.n) sometimes-cautious approach.

&gt;true, most executives would probably rather not get tangled in politics at all. but the gap between democrats and the financial sector has been growing for years. sinema’s exit, while it won’t change much in washington, gives wall street one more reason to come off the fence.

&gt;senator kyrsten sinema said on dec. 9 that she will change her party registration from democrat to political independent. the arizona senator said she plans to keep her committee seats and that she will not officially align with the republican party, signaling democrats will still hold an effective majority in the senate until the end of 2024.

blackstone said its returns speak for itself. “our business is built on performance, not fund flows, and performance is rock solid,” a spokesperson said, reiterating an earlier statement.

blackstone stock dropped to the lowest since april 2021 at 10:51 a.m. on friday, falling 3.6% to $74.59. shares have declined 42% this year.

lowering thresholds
blackstone has been continuing to make it easier for some investors to get into breit. starting this month, clients whose financial advisers route money to fidelity investments will be able to make minimum initial investments of $2,500 into breit’s lowest costing share class. the previous minimum for such customers was $1 million. a blackstone spokesman said the firm had been working toward this for months after clients asked for this option.

blackstone has mobilized its top executives in recent weeks to calm investor nerves. president jon gray went on cnbc to say the curbs prevented forced selling. schwarzman, the firm’s chief executive officer, said at a conference that breit’s redemptions have been spurred by investors needing liquidity for other reasons, rather than any indication of the fund’s performance.

the restrictions on withdrawals though have caused some advisers to harden their stance toward funds such as breit.

“it reinforced our view that we need to think of these as illiquid products,” said jeff demaso, director of research at newton, massachusetts-based adviser investments.",8,,JustBoatTrash,0

1671467224,whats even crazier is that bill gates owned half of all microsoft stock at one point. microsoft is worth nearly $2t. that means gates would have been worth $1t if he still owned all of that ms stock. he started selling and giving away most of it so he never got close to that number but just based on a companys valuation he would have been richer than everyone on this list combined.,62,,tiroc12,0
1671472147,"that’s not at all how it works. you don’t grow your billion dollar company without diluting your own shares. bill never retained more than 50% of ms once the company had more outside investors and becoming publicly traded. bill also pulled out of ms a long time ago. he currently only owns around 1.5% of ms stock. steve balmer, the follow up ms ceo, owns more ms shares than bill does. bill’s wealth came from investing in a bunch of different companies in the tech sector over past decades, which makes his portfolio a lot more diverse than other billionaires on the list whose wealths are tied to the respective companies they are in. 

by your own logic, bezos would own 100% of amazon since he’s the founder which makes his net worth near a trillion dollar. that’s not true. bezos owns around 11% of amazon currently, and that is still a massive amount considering the 2nd biggest owner of amazon has around 0.01% shares.",67,,Mirikado,0

1671590415,"don’t forget the gold mine. i saw a piece that it’s doing great ——&gt; excuse to invest another $100m in it. 

since retail mailed this company from the bowels of the gutter, made a guy a fortune who bought and basically started all this. but he’s sold, he still gets free shares as part of his $ms in compensation but he converted his investment to profit long ago. 

retail says ok to dilution once. then somehow they got the vote a second time. i think it’s time to check the hanging chad’s! regardless in a stock play that is trying for a short squeeze, more shares are the enemy. what’s he done since getting paid to be ceo? diluted the stock like crazy. then he was told no! omg, they said no, maybe the theres are waking up, there’s hope!  but we need to expose the shorts so let’s give a dividend that’s really part of the stock value? huh? i think the apes were sleeping again! wtf, did this happen? did they make it out like he’s saving the company? omg, i think he did a bad thing. i think he lied! now the 3 times number of shares is 6? the prices were dropping before it happened, maybe diamond hands bought real diamonds instead of the diluting stock! since then it’s dropped most days. but it’s ok, avatar will save them! want this move proven not to work several times already? maybe the apes are in a coma from all the toy jacking and exicement and they passed out. only the kids are left.

so he we are, recycling the best of “it didn’t work” reel and the price is really low. i’ve seen several plants lately about what happens are $0 so the intelligence that has reached critical mass can slam them down bc ape no sell! keep the eyes of the losses. they aren’t losers until you sell. i remember telling a girl years ago having sex didn’t take away her virginity, finishing sex did. yep, great times. 

why wasn’t this simple like gme?  one guy pumped it hard, got the squeeze teasing folks, great time to sell them it’s dropped out of discussion. rip. i guess movies need drama, well they got it. i’m jealous of a guy that but i’m with $ms, makes a killing, keeps making more, is idolized as he screws those idolizing him. i give it to him, he’s good.",1,,RHIT_Grad_1964,0

1672019384,"yep. people buy the stock, expecting it to go up, not caring at all about the company’s actual financials, and then when it goes up, they buy more of it, and they rarely sell, even in a downturn, because they’re delusional, like the gamestop apes, because they’re convinced that it will bounce back, bigger and better than ever. it’s inflated, based solely on misguided faith.

man, would i love to see that bubble pop. like, if vanguard or blackrock just decided to exit their position, which would cause the other institutional investors to exit their positions, because if five percent of the company hits the market, the stock is in free fall, and it would just get exacerbated as others exit. by the end of the day, the p/e is a hell of a lot more reasonable, but that’s because the stock took a dive by forty or fifty percent, wiping out gains from people who invested in 2020, and probably then some. and then musk would go on twitter to bitch about whoever started it, not realizing being the richest man on earth (though probably not anymore, at that point) doesn’t mean you’re the 800-pound gorilla, because blackrock holds trillions in assets, and nobody (sane) is going to dump blackrock stock just because musk said they were bad for selling their stock in his company.

1672147036,"this is literally the same feeling i had in 2001 and 2008. lived through both. was not involved in investing at the time, but did own some apple stock and watched it get absolutely crumped. sold at the bottom.

in 2008 i was in a very different financial situation than i am today. it was all doom and gloom. i remember being in the gym, watching cnbc every day at 10 am, working out. watching the market absolutely collapse one day. just shredding it self like a car throwing a rod at 90 miles an hour.

everything was horrible, we were all going to be living in huts, wealth being destroyed, the financial system teetering on the edge of collapse, calamity, bailouts, stuffing money into mattresses, running to gold.

you could get bank of america stock at the time for something like a dollar a share. that was basically some high beta shitco of today. aig was selling for less than a dollar a share. worlds largest insurer. a dollar a share. 

people were saying berkshire was going under, it's exposure to the insurance industry was way too big.

complete dismal doom and gloom. stories of people throwing themselves off of buildings.

and yes, that was one of the possible outcomes in the ""choose your own adventure"" of life.

1999, i worked in media. daytrading was taking off. e*trade was the new thing, people were talking about how they were making fortunes daytrading. i remember the headlines of when the dow crossed 10,000, holy crap that number was so epic. 

the fomo was everywhere. gold was dead, selling for $200 an ounce. gold miners were going out of business, mines were closing. ""gold is done. we never seeing gold over $600 again.""

then asian financial crisis. international investing is dead, there's no future in emerging markets. china is a failing. 

when it's bad, it always feels like it's never getting better. when it's good, it never feels like it's going to end. 

the problem is the bad always feels worse than a good.

i think it's the long time equity trader walt deemer who was quoted as saying, ""when it's time to buy, you won't want to.""

nobody knows if it's going to be a lost decade. equities might not return. it could be like japan in the 90s. it could be a big leg down before another insane run up where aggregate pe of the s&amp;p hits 40 again.

but having lived through 2001, 2008. watching markets absolutely prolapse, walt was right. when it's time to invest, everything in your body tells you you don't want to. i'm not talking the urge to ""buy the dip,"" i'm talking the, ""i'm going to buy a five year cd instead.""

it's important to zoom out. look at the long chart, the chart from 1929 to today. look at how insignificant even the great depression was, world war ii, the 1960s and 70s. you don't even see the impact of those. they're just undulations on a line that curves upward.

maybe that line will plateau, maybe it will continue upward. but even over 10 years on my 401k, i still have real returns far above inflation.

1672338653,"things are already crashing, so i don’t think there’s anything i can say to help you see it.  
  
one very obvious truth is sros and politicians love insider trading, and showing barely any transparency.  
  
if you’re not a shill and you had your eyes open last year when powell announced his investment portfolio sell-off with his reasoning being conflict-of-interest worries, you’d be able to put 2 &amp; 2 together.  
  
there was no reason to announce his sell-off other than he knew when the end of the infinite bull market was, sold at the top, and because investing is often a zero-sum game, he had to make sure the public didn’t see it as a warning sign. it’s also a bonus whenever you act unethically so brazenly and add some “good/honest person” points to your reputation.  
  
immediately after he and the numerous others announced their sell-offs, the dramatic drops started happening and there is no sign of recovering. companies are down 70%, 60%, crazy percentages across the market.
after that is when the literal definition for a recession finally happened, which is still being tip-toed around.  
  
in what world does powell do what he did as a coincidence? the baby-crashing was almost immediately after. and it’s been a year, and no signs of letting up. and we’re in a recession. when we previously had an unbelievable everlasting bull market that would eventually experience a correction.  
  
in what world of economic cycles and timelines is it a coincidence that there’s a massive sell-off from many top officials happening right before a crashing market which not only fails to recover towards the upward trend, but persists until we reach recession level?  
  
in what world does a bull market that’s healthy and totally not going to crash get interrupted with all of this for this long, along with increasing interest rates, mortgages, plummeting mbs values (like in 2008), and then continue the bullishness?  
  
the timeline alone (over a year(s) now) is indicative of a new cycle, a new trend. this isn’t millisecond, daytrading-mindset peaks and valleys. this is non-stop months/quarters of opposite movement, lower highs and even lower lows.  
  
not to mention the divorces of many of the top billionaires the last couple of years.  
  
warren buffet, *the* long-term investor of long-term investors, held wells fargo stock for decades i believe. is it a coincidence that he chose of the past couple of years to sell it off in its entirety after holding for so long?  
  
in what rational market does the market crash in 2020 and recover almost immediately *without* involving insane money-printing volume that creates likely an even bigger mess to worry about in the future?  
  
no rational market. and the insane money printing from 2020 to now should be acknowledged as something that will lead to eventual ramifications down the line. hopefully, you get that. and if you get that, then this neverending shitshow should ring at least one alarm bell that maybe the ramifications have arrived.  
  
literally, many asset-backed securities, like mbs are tanking below what they were in 2008.  
  
we have 2008 as precedent to compare to. we have set definitions for words like “recession”.  
  
we are not only matching 2008 precedents, we have exceeded some of them already.  
  
if none of that matters,  
if you refuse to acknowledge the existence of corruption,  
and if your foundation is full of general, vague “rules” of the market that you treat like actual dogmatic universal truths (like, the market tends to correct itself … you can’t predict when this or that happens so don’t do anything)  
  
then i can see how you be able to remain optimistic about the market.  
  
if that’s how it is and you’re sticking to it, more power to you. but if you’re someone that consciously ignores precedent, inflation, recessions, shady sell-off timings around crashes, tech companies and more nosediving all over the place, i don’t know why you’re asking for proof.  
  
you’ll clearly only accept direct, personal instructions from buffett or powell showing you what the hft algorithms have in store for next year as proof that it would not be unwise to do something as *unbelievably drastic* as …  
  
putting everything/something into cash/money market funds. so crazy. buffett must become senile having half of his portfolio in cash at some point in the last two years.  
  
i just don’t get it.
  
ignore the fact that everything is trending downward. the fact that bull markets are not 100% guaranteed means strategies for bear markets are a logical plan b to consider, discuss, and think about.  
  
but people like you refuse to even *think* about it, probably encouraging people to take losses in stride because there was no way they could predict the market, so don’t even risk putting some of your portfolio in cash during a downward trend to lower tour losses.  
  
anyway, you’re  
  
-	either a shill,  
-	someone with no skin in the game,  
-	someone with enough money to not be affected either way so you just treat these discussions about the real world as academic debates about economic theory and you want to win the debate,  
  
all of the above are not worth respecting, *and* you should practice some self-awareness by not pretending you want to have a conversation in good faith.
—
lastly, you could be someone that was tricked into completely trusting the system and conflating optimistic outlooks of market as actual unbroken laws of market nature, and you’re committed to that sunk-cost at cost of whatever losses you endure and whatever failing strategies you recommend to others. as long as it means you weren’t at any point fooled by the market.  
  
i actually sympathize with this, but in the end, that’s a you problem that you shouldn’t spread to others.    
  
i mean, the fact that there are people in this world like dave lauer who was a quant for citadel, or sussanne trimbath who worked for the dtcc, and the martens of wall street on parade . com… people who believed in the market as much as you do, and maybe even *more* than you at some point, but didn’t run away from the truth and instead are doing what they can to enact positive change that can fix the market and result in it acting like we *thought* it did already…  
  
i would think that would give people like you pause.   -     to consider that the truth is more important than being right and not being fooled.
-	to consider that being fooled is not something that only happens to idiots and should be considered as something that happens to *everyone*, including *quants* and we just don’t talk about it, so it should be nothing more than something you brush off to learn how to not be fooled next time, as opposed to bending over backwards for an entire lifetime to make sure that you weren’t mistaken.  
-	 to consider that being fooled means you’re one step closer to the truth and can now advocate for it and fight for it, and that’s respectable.  
-	 to consider the life of someone fighting to educate everyone, not just themselves, and compare it to the life of someone whose single most important priority until they die is fighting to be right.  
  
  
i don’t know, man. in everything, i’d rather accept uncomfortable truths and messy, mistake-ridden transition periods than be so defensive of my ego that it results in me parroting whatever bs the .01% want me to believe so they can continue earning record profits while inflation worsens and they steal more and money from the regular people.  
  
and lastly, the market involves our money, so it’s not just that knowing the truth should be what’s important. it’s also acknowledging the truth will lead to you *also* protecting your money.  
  
tl;dr -  
  
different strokes for different folks, i guess. never mind the fact that it doesn’t have to be black and white and we can always make an honest effort to remain open-minded to a couple of new things here and there. it’s not like in the grand scheme of life, staying close-minded and defensive will result in literally defending an enormous amount of lies for *decades* for a decidedly shallow reason.  
  
anyway, everyone would be doing themselves a favor even just going on investopedia to look up ways to invest during a recession or any downtrend. the fact that people are out here maintaining that they’re logical, rational, and more sensible even though pensions and 401(k) have been destroyed before is wild to me. hedge funds literally hedge their bets and it’s sophisticated. calls, puts, how the fuck is this different? how can people actually believe that hedging against once-every-decade recessions, known-to-exist events that last for years is different and not worth considering despite the fact that regular people would benefit most from hedging compared to hedgefunds?  
  
this kind of close-mindedness is baffling. in the age of the internet, it shouldn’t exist. in the midst of inflation and the ever-growing chasm of wealth inequality, this shit shouldn’t exist.",-1,,EthErealist,0

&gt; wong: when elon musk acquired twitter, he used a kind of deal that was really popular in the 1980s - the leveraged buyout. this is typically where an investment firm acquires a company using borrowed money, other people's money. that borrowed money is the leverage.

&gt; woods: carl tack is a former lawyer and investment banker. he's now an adjunct professor of finance at the college of william &amp; mary. we caught him up on the landline to have him explain leveraged buyouts to us.

&gt; wong: what makes a leveraged buyout unique is who ends up on the hook for the borrowed money. now, the money typically comes from banks, but it's not the investment firm that borrows the money; it's the company getting acquired.

&gt; woods: i mean, this is such a mind-bender. like, the company is taking on debt so that itself can get bought. and you might wonder why a company would agree to do this. like, why would it agree to a leveraged buyout? well, sometimes, it's an exit strategy, you know, for the company's owners or the company's shareholders. and in twitter's case, elon was offering a price well above where the company's shares were trading at the time.

&gt; tack: the end result is that that loan is a loan not to elon musk; it's a loan to twitter.


**source 2**: [""explainer: how elon musk funded the $44 billion twitter deal""]
(https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-will-elon-musk-pay-twitter-2022-10-07/)

&gt; musk pledged to provide $46.5 billion in equity and debt financing for the acquisition, which covered the $44 billion price tag and the closing costs. banks, including morgan stanley (ms.n) and bank of america corp (bac.n), committed to provide $13 billion in debt financing.

&gt; musk's $33.5 billion equity commitment included his 9.6% twitter stake, which is worth $4 billion, and the $7.1 billion he had secured from equity investors, including oracle corp (orcl.n) co-founder larry ellison and saudi prince alwaleed bin talal.

&gt; that had left musk in need for an additional $22.4 billion of funds to cover the equity financing portion of the deal.
&gt; ...
&gt; according to a reuters calculation, musk had about $20 billion cash after selling part of his stake in tesla through multiple transactions in november and december last year and april and august.

&gt; musk would have needed to raise an additional $2 billion to $3 billion to complete the financing for the deal.
