without even talking about insurance that protects banks from insolvency, ftx was doing all kinds of shady crap that would not fly in the banking world. imagine walking into wells fargo with $50 million in wells fargo stock and asking for a loan of $100 million in cash. the risk to the bank is massive and puts a huge amount of power in the hands of the borrower. that kind of risk would never be accepted in the banking world, but that kind of exchange is fundamental to ftx‚Äôs business model where they were happy to lend out money in exchange for their own token. it leads to a unique form of a bank run: a death spiral.",9,,differing,0

&gt; the pilot will test how banks using digital dollar tokens in a common database can help speed up payments.

1668972170,"put simply, shorting a stock is when you borrow shares from someone who owns it for an agreed period of time, sell it to someone else and then agree with the person you're selling it to, to buy it back in time to return it to the original seller.

the reason you would do this is because you think the stock is going to drop in value between you selling your borrowed stock and having to buy it back again. if you can sell the stock for $50 a share and then buy it back at only $20 a share then you've just made a healthy $30 profit per share.

in short: you're betting that the share value of a company will go down during a fixed period of time.

gamestop has been struggling significantly over the last few years, unable to adapt to the rise of digital storefronts similar to blockbuster back in the day. a lot of large, wealthy traders around the world had been planning to short the stock (bet it will go down), confident in their predictions.

a few online communities - especially /r/wallstreetbets - decided to mess with the big traders by forcing the stock to sky rocket instead, generating huge losses for everyone who shorted the stock. how do you force stock value to rise? buy lots of it. as with anything in high demand, the price goes up when there is demand to buy the stock. and so, large numbers of people conspired to buy up as much gs stock as possible for the lols, and the stock price did indeed shoot up suddenly.

the controversy around the shutting down of trading on platforms like robinhood, was that it was seen by many as a deliberate attempt to protect the big trading conglomerates who had shorted the stock, and a form of market manipulation to stop the gs stock rising. of course, you could also argue that large groups of people conspiring online to do the opposite is also market manipulation, but that is where i'm not qualified to weigh in on who is right or wrong...",49,,Neoptolemus85,0

ryan cohen ignored the naysayers when he cofounded an online pet-supplies retailer in 2011 and squared off against amazon and pets.com.

he ultimately sold the company for $3.4 billion in 2017, and stepped down as ceo the following year to spend more time with his family and pursue personal goals.

cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks, apple and wells fargo. he later placed a contrarian bet on gamestop and secured three seats on the video-game retailer's board in january, laying the groundwork for an astronomical rally in its stock price.

the entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, ted cohen, who passed away in december 2019, and warren buffett, the billionaire investor and berkshire hathaway ceo.

""something critical that i learned from my dad and warren buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" cohen told insider in an october interview.

the pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style.""

for example, many people initially doubted chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money.

""in the early years, few investors thought chewy was a good idea,"" cohen said. ""i struck out raising capital over 100 times.""

ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled cohen to focus on the things most critical to chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.

the former chewy chief credited his dad, who ran a glassware-importing business, with giving him the courage of his convictions.

cohen's father taught him to trust his instincts, treated him like an adult from an early age, solicited and listened to his opinions, and demonstrated what it meant to deeply understand a business.

""i learned how to build my company by watching him build his,"" cohen said.

going all in

after selling chewy, cohen plowed the bulk of his windfall into apple and wells fargo, flouting traditional investment advice about the need for a diversified portfolio.

cohen felt comfortable with his decision partly because he bought his first apple share at age 15, making it one of the first stocks he ever owned. the technology titan's ecosystem of hardware, software, and services ‚Äî which makes it a headache for users to switch to rival products ‚Äî was a key attraction, he said.

apple's offerings have become even more integral to people's lives during the pandemic, cohen argued. people increasingly rely on their iphones, ipads, macbooks, and apps to keep in touch with friends and family, work from home, conduct daily tasks such as shopping and banking, and entertain themselves.

""the strongest business in the world,"" cohen proclaimed, echoing buffett's comment in february 2020 that apple is ""probably the best business i know.""

cohen also brushed off concerns about apple's valuation, arguing that it's relatively cheap when rock-bottom interest rates mean bonds are yielding close to zero.

cohen declined to comment on his wells fargo and gamestop investments.

betting like buffett

cohen's emphasis on focus, independent thought, and investing with conviction aren't the only strategies he shares with buffett.

the chewy cofounder cited 'disciplined capital allocation,"" or spending money strategically and responsibly, as a key driver of his company's success. buffett specializes in taking the cash flowing into berkshire from its scores of subsidiaries, and redeploying it where it's needed most.

cohen focused on selling pet food at chewy, because he recognized that customers would slash every expense they could before cutting back on feeding their pets, resulting in a ""sticky"" customer base.

consumables offered slimmer profit margins than toys or accessories, but the lifetime value of their buyers relative to the cost of acquiring them meant they generated higher returns in the long haul, he added.

buffett famously favors companies that sell essential or staple products and services to a dedicated customer base. for example, berkshire counts american express, visa, mastercard, coca-cola, procter &amp; gamble, and kraft heinz among the roughly 45 stocks in its portfolio.

cohen and buffett also have investments in common. apple is by far the most valuable holding in berkshire's portfolio, and the conglomerate owned $3 billion worth of wells fargo stock at the last count.

finally, cohen practices buffett's advice to ""be greedy when others are fearful.""

""value doesn't move but stock prices do, creating an opportunity if you have the right temperament to buy stuff on sale,"" he said.",1,,MrDapperDon,0

[by jonathan stempel](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/buffetts-berkshire-discloses-big-taiwan-semi-stake-2022-11-14/)

  
nov 14 (reuters) - berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n) said it bought more than $4.1 billion of stock in taiwan semiconductor manufacturing (2330.tw), , a rare significant foray into the technology sector by billionaire warren buffett's conglomerate.  
the news sent shares in tsmc soaring, closing up 7.9% in taiwan on tuesday, as it boosted investor sentiment for the world's largest contract chipmaker, which saw its shares hit a two-year low last month due to a sharp slowdown in global chip demand.

tsmc's other foreign investors include u.s. asset managers blackrock inc (blk.n) and vanguard group inc, and singapore sovereign wealth fund gic (gic.ul).  
berkshire also disclosed new stakes of $297 million in building materials company louisiana-pacific corp (lpx.n) and $13 million in jefferies financial group inc (jef.n). it exited an investment in store capital corp (stor.n), a real estate company that agreed in september to be taken private.  
the filing did not specify whether buffett or his portfolio managers todd combs and ted weschler made specific purchases and sales. investors often try to piggy back on what berkshire buys. larger investments are normally buffett's.  
while berkshire does not normally make big technology bets, it often prefers companies it perceives to have competitive advantages, often through their size.  
tsmc, which makes chips for the likes of apple inc (aapl.o), qulacomm (qcom.o) and nvidia corp (nvda.o), posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit last month, but struck a more cautious note than usual on upcoming demand.

""i suspect berkshire has a belief that the world cannot do without the products manufactured by taiwan semi,"" said tom russo, a partner at gardner, russo &amp; quinn in lancaster, pennsylvania, which owns berkshire shares.  
""only a small number of companies that can amass the capital to deliver semiconductors, which are increasingly central to people's lives,"" he added.  
berkshire has had mixed success in technology.  
its more than six-year wager during the last decade in ibm corp (ibm.n) did not pan out, but berkshire is sitting on huge unrealized gains on its $126.5 billion stake in apple, which buffett views more as a consumer products company.  
apple is by far the largest investment in berkshire's $306.2 billion equity portfolio.  
berkshire disclosed the tsmc stake about 2-1/2 months after it began reducing a decade-old, multi-billion dollar stake in byd co (002594.sz), china's largest electric car company.  
in the third quarter, berkshire added to its stakes in chevron corp (cvx.n), occidental petroleum corp (oxy.n), celanese corp (ce.n), paramount global (para.o) and rh (rh.n).  
it also sold shares of activision blizzard inc (atvi.o), bank of new york mellon corp (bk.n), general motors co (gm.n), kroger co (kr.n) and us bancorp (usb.n).  
buffett, 92, has run berkshire since 1965. the omaha, nebraska-based company also owns dozens of businesses such as the bnsf railroad, the geico auto insurer, several energy and industrial companies, fruit of the loom and dairy queen.",1,,JeebusBuiltMyHotRod,0
