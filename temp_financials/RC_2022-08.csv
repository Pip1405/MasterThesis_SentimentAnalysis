**private equity needs more other-people’s-money**  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
*deutsche bank, credit suisse and jp morgan will begin marketing the* ***first-ever bond backed by us home-rental cashflows****, a us$500 million trade for private-equity giant blackstone, next wednesday.*   
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
new york, aug 4 (reuters breakingviews) - for the likes of blackstone (bx.n) and kkr (kkr.n), equity and debt go together like peanut butter and jelly. buyout firms are sitting on $1.4 trillion in cash, but in order to do deals, they need leverage with which to pair it. there aren’t many places for them to find it, at least not in the quantities they might wish.  


when steve schwarzman’s private equity lieutenants at blackstone, or their peers, want to buy a company, they typically pair a wad of cash provided by their fund investors with debt. that allows them to target bigger acquisitions, and increase the returns to their equity investors and themselves, by paying down the debt as quickly as possible from the acquired company’s cash flows.  


but the syndicated loan market, where bank loans backing private equity deals are parceled up and passed around, has slowed sharply. deals supporting highly-indebted mergers and acquisitions totaled $46 billion in the second quarter, down by 52% from the same period in 2021, according to refinitiv. the market has sagged as investors grapple with rising interest rates and banks try to offload loans made before the market soured.  


direct lenders who pool private money, lend to deals and keep hold of those loans – can take up some of the slack. after growing rapidly, they now regularly support big buyouts. direct loans typically cost more than syndicated loans but are faster and can be offered in situations where banks dare not tread.

the catch is that the two debt markets are interlinked. a borrower can take out a direct loan, pay it down until public investors would find it acceptable, then refinance it in the syndicated market after a couple years to get a cheaper interest rate. the direct lender can use that   
repaid money to immediately fund new deals. but syndicated refinancings for leveraged loans were 41% lower in the first half of 2022 than a year earlier, per refinitiv.  


private lenders who have money to invest can thus cherry-pick the best deals. but those who don’t have money may struggle to get more. the amount of private credit funding raised, while similar to a year ago, is running a third below its peak in late 2021, according to preqin. private equity might be ready to put its vast reserves of cash to work. but without ample debt, much of that so-called dry powder might have to stay dry.

direct lenders' dry powder stands at an estimated $210 billion as of the beginning of august, according to preqin. private equity dry powder excluding venture capital, meanwhile, has reached roughly $1.4 trillion.

capital raised by direct lenders totaled $25 billion in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $27.4 billion the prior year but down by a third from the fourth quarter.

u.s. syndicated leveraged loan refinancing volume fell to $249 billion in the first half of the year, down roughly 41% from the year prior, according to refinitiv.

1659800239,"&gt;the slide in u.s. stock prices punished berkshire hathaway inc's (brka.n) bottom line in the second quarter as the company run by billionaire warren buffett posted a $43.8 billion loss.

&gt;berkshire nevertheless generated nearly $9.3 billion of profit from its operating businesses, as improvement from reinsurance and the bnsf railroad offset a loss at the geico car insurer, where car parts shortages and higher vehicle prices boosted losses from accidents.

&gt;rising interest rates and dividend payouts helped berkshire's insurance units generate more money from investments, while the strengthening u.s. dollar boosted profit from the company's european and japanese debt investments.

&gt;berkshire also slowed purchases of its stocks, including its own, though it ended june with $105.4 billion of cash and equivalents it could still deploy.

&gt;""it shows the fickle nature of markets,"" said tom russo, a partner at gardner, russo &amp; quinn in lancaster, pennsylvania, who invests more than $8 billion, of which 17% is in berkshire. ""it's business as usual at berkshire hathaway.""

&gt;net results suffered from berkshire's $53 billion of losses from investments and derivatives.

1660089563,"i'm not the person who made the original distinction, but here's my take.

factors and styles are basically the same thing. some firms will tell you that there are subtle differences between them but it's basically all the same thing. aqr says [they're the same](https://funds.aqr.com/insights/fund-promo/style-investing). russell says factors indexes are just [more concentrated style indexes](https://www.ftserussell.com/research/styles-vs-factors-what-they-are-how-theyre-similardifferent-and-how-they-fit-within). 

though when i personally think about the difference between the two, the first thing that comes to mind is the [venn model](https://www.venn.twosigma.com/factors) by two sigma. in that model, factors are basically considered to be drivers of a portfolio's risk/return profile. pretty standard. but there's a split between macro factors and style factors. macro factors represent exposure to things like market, rates and credit risk (core macro) or secondary macro variables like fx risk, inflation-linked vs nominal rates risk (so basically t5yie and t10yie), home country vs foreign market risk (like us vs ex-us for an american investor, canada vs ex-canada for a canadian, etc.). on the other hand, styles represent exposure to *cross-sectional* drivers of risk and return like value and momentum in equities or carry in currencies.

styles are also more of a practitioner-based concept than factors. you don't really see them mentioned that much in academia. there, factors are often seen as proxies for consumption risk (merton's icapm state variable candidates) or expressions of firm-decisions that predict differences in firm-level cost of capital (zhang's icapm factors).

however, these semantics don't really matter. they have nothing to with your criticisms of value. think of the trades a value manager would have on right now. it's not a static long energy and financials short tech portfolio. and even if it was, all throughout this post you're implying that there's a tech industry premium (""modern tech growth strategies are so great"" and things like that) without anything to back it up. but back to the trades. just comparing the enterprise multiples (or p/es for banks) of some household names, it would be long $meta and short (or underweight) $pins. long $trow and short $blk. long $gs and short $ms. long $pep and short $ko. and these trades would probably just be on for a few months or less until the longs were repriced and migrated out of the value basket and/or the shorts were repriced and migrated out of the growth basket. how does a blitzscaling startup mechanically make these trades lose money? about 80% of them won't even be in tech sector. and the majority of those that are will be long and short mature firms. and even then, how does a random tech company's rapid asset growth make the expensive banks or asset managers or food and beverage companies beat the cheap ones? and that's before all the issues we know rapid asset growers face (terrible empirical performance, theoretically low cost of capital holding productivity constant per zhang's icapm, historically poor earnings growth in periods of low payout ratios for the market as a whole, etc.). i'm not saying the idea is completely terrible, there's definitely a lot of merit to the q-eg factor and to investing in companies with high levels of intangible investment, but even those strategies don't kill value investing. they're completely separate. the long-term correlation coefficient between hml and expected growth is 0.06. it's even positive. and the guy who discovered the expected growth factor literally publicly stated that he still has his own money in scv... 

anyways, it seems like you have a background in finance, so what do you even want us to tell you? you already know these counterarguments, so what do you really want to hear? that all academic and practitioner research on stock selection since fama-french or even security analysis is completely useless now despite the fact that new evidence confirming those core ideas is still continuously being brought to light? do you want the green light to buy arkk? pre-ipo shares in the next uber but for pool supplies?",4,,throwaway474673637,0

1660569371,"small adjustment to your understanding... there are mutual funds and etfs that are 'actively managed' which is is the ""put your money in the hands of experts"" situation. these are smart people [occasionally] doing smart people things behind the scenes. they're human, so they can make mistakes.

index funds mostly take the humans out of it (i.e. 'passively managed'). there are usually hard rules to determine if a company meets the qualifications to be in a specific index. if yes then buy else don't buy.

for example, the retail sector index ([xrt](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/consumer-cyclical/spdr-s-p-retail-etf/xrt#about)) only includes retail companies. so it'll buy best buy stock but it won't buy bank of america stock because bank of america will be in the financial sector index ([vfh](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vfh))

these two 'sector' indexes still involve humans (i.e. you) to pick the sector that will have a lot of winners and not a lot of losers.

the simplest path to wealth is to pick the total us stock market index ([vtsax](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vtsax/vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-admiral-shares)) which buys every single stock in the us. if publicly traded stock in us then buy else don't buy.

or if you're nervous about picking the us as the winner over every other country, you can pick a total world stock index fund ([vtwax](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vtwax/vanguard-total-world-stock-index-fund-admiral-shares))

the point is, index funds are less smart people doing smart people things and instead just passively following whatever index they've been created to follow. it's more rule based and thus more predictable

average people should pick the biggest index they're comfortable with (us or world) so that they're ultra diversified and will own all the winners. you just have to trust that capitalism and government intervention will make sure there are more winners than losers in aggregate",4,,mildly_enthusiastic,0

1661038906,"on 7 september 2001, the number of ‘put options’* on british airways was four times normal volumes. british airways shares dropped 42 per cent over the following week.

between 6-7 september, 4 744 put options were bought on united airlines, six times the normal volumes. assuming that 4 000 of these options were bought by terrorists with advance knowledge of the imminent attacks, these ‘insiders’ would have profited by almost $5 million.

on 10 september, 4 516 put options were bought on american airlines, 285 times normal volumes. assuming that 4 000 of these options were purchased by ‘terrorist insiders’, they would have netted a gain of about $4 million.

morgan stanley occupied 22 floors of the world trade centre and was severely affected by the attacks. trading of put options on morgan stanley stock averaged 27 contracts per day before 6 september, but from 6 – 10 september, 2 157 ‘october $45 put options’ were purchased. morgan stanley’s share price fell from us$48.90 to us$42.50 in the aftermath of the attacks. assuming that 2 000 of these contracts were bought with knowledge of the approaching attacks, these purchasers could have profited by at least $1.2 million.

merrill lynch had headquarters near the twin towers and averaged 252 contracts per day before 6 september. the period 5-10 september saw 12 215 ‘october $45 put options’ bought. when trading resumed after the attacks, merrill lynch’s shares fell from us$46.88 to us$41.50. assuming that 11 000 option contracts were bought by ‘terrorist insiders’ their profit would have been about $5.5 million.

a raytheon option that makes money if shares are more than $25 each had 232 options contracts traded on the day before the attacks, almost six times the total number of trades that had occurred before that day. a contract represents options on 100 shares. raytheon shares soared almost 37 percent to $34.04 during the first week of post-attack u.s. trading",5,,[deleted],0

for example, microsoft didn't pay dividends until 2004.  your purchase in 1986 of ms for $0.10 (split adjusted) would have to wait almost twenty years before you started getting the first quarterly dividend of $0.08.  by then the share price was $27; the dividend hardly seems like the motivation for buying the stock, even if you got in on the (retail) ground floor.

if you bought your ms stock in 2000 for $20, and held until now, you would have accumulated $20.63 in the last 18 years in dividends.  this seems like a pretty poor return (less than 4%).  meanwhile, the current price is $274.",2,,steve_b,0

1661375950,"as someone who is responsible (sorry) for shifting a major it software vendor from perpetual products to subscription i can safely say you have a lot of assumptions that are invalid.

loosing customers who paid once and never paid again doesn't matter as it doesn't drive revenue and only generates costs.

while a company is in growth mode (customer acquisition) it doesn't matter as the growth in revenue from new customers is enough to keep shareholders happy and generate big exec bonuses.  the increasing cashflow of net new customers pays for the expansion and maintenance.

once a company finds it has tapped out a growth strategy that becomes unsustainable  due to what happens to cash flow.

at this point a company needs to find other ways to pay the recurring costs of all those customers they acquired - the growth in net new customers is not enough to cover those costs at the margins required.

that's just one angle, i have others like this, but don't want to bore you, lol :-)

1661395705,"if you’re interested in real estate, you have to start at cash flow. how long are you willing to wait to become cash flow positive?

residential real estate might give you leverage but you’re at the whim of residential tenancies laws and tenants. a lot (i’d say most but can’t back that with data) of tenants are genuinely pretty good. but there is a class of people who are professionals at gaming the system. because of this, it is remarkably hard to be cash flow positive with a single residential property. leverage is nice, but you always have to account for needing to drop $10k+ into your property before it is rentable again. and if you go residential, you have to be prepared to go 12-18 months without getting paid rent.

commercial is another option. i’m biased in favour of commercial because i bought into the commercial world a long time ago and it’s been a great investment. it’s more expensive but way more predictable and if you’re remotely entrepreneurial, you can often become your own tenant. you get the same leverage but with more predictable cash flows (unless you’re bad).

anyways, on to your questions.

corporate structure is complicated and i really recommend asking a very good lawyer. owning real estate will make you an attractive target for law suits. if i had hired a lawyer when i first got into commercial real estate, i would be about a decade ahead of where i am. don’t be me - lawyer up as soon as you can, tell them everything and do exactly what they say. they are experts at taking money from people who own real estate - take their advice on how to protect your money from other versions of them. there are too many variables to even start to get into here.

as for management companies, i have been really lucky. i started working with a realtor who was just getting started in his career but whose parents were extremely successful in the industry. i have always asked him for help and always ended up with great management companies. anecdotally, i have worked with four different management companies and they are all husband/wife teams. for all four, one partner has a ticket in a trade and the other is an accountant. it makes sense when you think about it, but the commonalities are really crazy to think about.

as for units, obviously i’m biased in favour of commercial over residential. commercial has its own bullshit but it’s way more predictable provided you or your representative is good at negotiating. buying a property is a lot like looking at a property - find quality builds (so you don’t spend your ‘leverage’ fixing shit. location matters to an extent but also remember the joys of gentrification. my very favourite holding was located in a complete shit hole area in a shit hole city when i bought it. then it got gentrified and between the craft brewer and tech companies with founders who are way cooler than me, i am beyond happy.

calgary is a weird city because of the o&amp;g boom and busts. when oil is low, you’ll find bargains. when oil is high, you’ll pay $ms for cardboard. on the other hand, when oil is high, you’ll lease to coke fiends and when oil is low, they can’t afford to look. areas are really unpredictable- the city seems to gentrify or go to shit on seven year cycles. i keep hearing that calgary will become a tech centre but the founders absolutely suck at being alive.

if i owned residential, i’d do one or two pets (but no more) and drop rent for good tenants. some people are really responsible and just want a stable place for their animals. those are the kinds of tenants i’d like. commercial is the opposite. take your dog to work companies go out of business.

i hope this helps a bit but it’s just my experience.",1,,Sudden-Ad7209,0

i, 18f, had a lot of problems last semester  with my spanish teacher, for context, i have cptsd and relaxation exercises give me panic attacks because i cannot relax, this teacher, who we'll call ms.n required her entire class to do relaxation exercises despite it being on my 504, that i do not have to do anything related to counseling in my classes as teachers aren't properly trained to deal with the fall out of my extensive trauma. 

now every single day i would have to re-explain the problem to ms.n that she could look at my 504, and that i would under no circumstances do the exercises. and multiple times she tried to write me up for insubordination, we also had multiple issues of her setting me up to be bullied by making me talk about my family in front of the class which led to a lot of mocking and bullying by other students for stupid things like having 16 siblings, or having to ask how to say ""foster parent"" in spanish. basically the entirety of last semester there was something that i had to explain to her that i couldn't do because it made me uncomfortable, i feel it important to note that no other teacher has ever had problems with the accommodations i receive, especially considering i have the proper paperwork. it got so bad that last semester for the last two days i just skipped spanish, despite having severe anxiety over being absent.

this previous week i met with my counselor and multiple of my teachers and we discussed that i have to take spanish ii  and my counselor insisted i have ms.n , but i argued back in front of her that that last semester it was a different issue everyday and that i could not properly learn in an environment like that, even arguing that my ""straight a's"" didn't prober her to be a competent teacher as i make an a in every class regardless of the teacher, and that my problem is not my learning, but my comfort. eventually my counselor agreed to place me in the other spanish teacher's class, 

when i got home and explained what happened with the counselor to my foster mom she said that she felt it was an asshole move to lay out all of problems bin front of ms.n and all of my other teachers, but i think that it was important for me to advocate for myself and i doubt asking for privacy would have helped. in addition to that, she is a teacher and should be accustomed to understanding that sometimes people just don't work well together. so am i the asshole?

\-focus on raising your income so that you can put more money per month in safer investments like $vti $voo $schd etc. go to college if needed, get a degree that pays well, etc. (consider the tuition as an investment for future income)- but please don’t get a degree that doesn’t pay well, or in the worse case, you can’t find a job!

  
\-contribute consistently, sit back, relax, and retire in \~40 years from now. if you are in focus, you will be really wealthy in 40 years.

1661825235,"congratulations on starting your investing journey early! i wish i had started sooner! i am not an investing guru, but here is what i am doing with my capital/ money. hopefully, this gives you some insight on my strategy: 

  
1. 401k from the employer: i am investing bi-weekly in my 401k account- i chose 4 different funds to equally contribute (25% each): 1 s&amp;p 500 fund, 1 high growth tech fund, 1 small cap fund, and 1 international fund. i do rebalance this account once or twice a year, but other than that it's purely passive ""buy &amp; hold"" investing (time horizon 15-20 years). 

  
2. roth ira account: i have a roth ira account, where i mostly invest in high-quality dividend stocks. i don’t have to pay taxes on my dividends in a roth ira account, so that’s the primary motivation for choosing a roth ira for dividend investing. i have some high-quality growth stocks too, which don’t pay any dividends now, but hopefully, in 10-15 years, they will. also, i do some active trading on this account to boost my returns: buy low/sell high (tax-free capital gains, however, the risk is if you lose the money you can’t claim a capital loss, so be careful!). some of my holdings: $goog $intc $lrcx $amat $mmm $vz $meta $baba $vti $iwf $trow $sbux $blk $jpm $csco $rio $cmcsa $dpz $adbe $mdt $klac $sny $rhhby $gsk $nvs $ul $qcom $dow 

  
3. individual brokerage account: this is my individual account where i buy high-quality growth stocks to hold for long-term (5-10 years or more). i can claim losses on this account. at the end of the year, i look at my taxable income on this account and sell some of the losers to offset my taxable capital gains. some of my holdings are: $amzn $meta $nflx $pypl $bkng $dis $ea $googl and about 25% cash to deploy (hopefully soon)

  
4. individual brokerage account (for options): a separate individual brokerage account only for options trading. this is around \~5% of my entire portfolio.   
  
i hope you get some idea from this…..",2,,ali_b_investing,0
