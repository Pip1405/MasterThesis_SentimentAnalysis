($ gs 7-10) + 2x[( $gs 9-2)-($gs 9-1)]= x

step increase intervals are time in step based. step 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4 are one year at the step. 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7 are 2 years, and 7 to 8, 8 to 9, 9 to 10 are 3 years. 
plan accordingly, if you were supposed to get a step increase say from gs13-4 to gs 13-5 july 1, but you get the grade increase instead on june 15th, not planning accordingly cost you 2 years of time in step and if you would have delayed you program 2 weeks you would be a gs 14- 2 rather than a gs 14-1.",1,,TEAMT-n-T,0

if you're totally new to inbesting, get a paper trading account and just practice. there will be many, many more chances to swing trade a ""big"" market event. don't get antsy and blow a bunch of money on fomo. but if you're going to anyways, watch a bunch of youtube first. understand what it is you are doing.

don't be a dumbass and *sell* options positions to open. do not. under any circumstances. *buy to open* options positions. buyers of call or put options are limited in their losses to the cost of the option. sellers of options face theoretically unlimited losses. don't wind up with a bill for 15 thousand dollars on a $400 bet. it is totally possible. people around here do it *all the time*.

don't buy fd's, a 30dte or more position is more suitable for swing trading. 0dte is for day traders who have met capital requirements and can buy/sell on margin (as in, they won't violate t+2 by moving money on and off different positions many times throughout the trading day).

yeah and btw, look up t+2, i have the feeling a lot of new people are going to get locked out of trading for 90 days while their short dated ""genius"" puts expire worthless.

probably stick to index etfs like $spy rather than individual stocks, even if you have a good ""thesis"" $spy is easier to predict by looking at vix (volatility index) and other shit. probably stick to itm or nearly itm, and a simple stop loss.

again, watch a bunch of youtube videos. avoid the shills.

1665798160,"‚Äúu .s. banks wrote down $1 billion on leveraged and bridge loans in the second quarter as rising interest rates made it tougher for them to offload high-risk debt onto investors and other lenders.

this was highlighted by the sale in september of $8.55 billion in loans and bonds backing the leveraged buyout of business software company citrix systems inc (ctxs.mx).

a group of banks led by bank of america (bac.n), credit suisse (csgn.s) and goldman sachs (gs.n) took a collective $700 million loss on the deal, reuters previously reported.

morgan stanley ceo james gorman said his bank has been ""quite cautious in the leveraged finance arena."" he later added, ""frankly, it's just not that troubling.""

the turmoil in the leveraged finance market is also weighing on mergers and acquisitions, which slowed sharply in the third quarter.

""there‚Äôs no doubt that the cost of capital has gone up materially for debt financing of private equity transactions over the past 6-9 months,"" said kevin sterling, global co-head of private credit at goldman sachs during an event this month. that means borrowers need more cash to operate in an environment with higher costs, he said.‚Äù",4,,BikkaZz,0

1666332162,"guten morgen zusammen, ein letztes mal diese woche gibt es mein kurzes morgenupdate.

in br√ºssel haben sich die staats- und regierungschefs der eu-staaten beim gipfeltreffen auf gemeinsame ma√ünahmen zur eind√§mmung der ansteigenden energiepreise geeinigt. die 27 l√§nder haben sich unter anderen darauf geeinigt, an einem gemeinsamen gaspreisdeckel arbeiten zu wollen. von der leyen zufolge unterst√ºtzten die eu-staaten au√üerdem den j√ºngsten gesetzesvorschlag der eu-kommission, in zukunft gemeinsam gas einzukaufen, um die macht des europ√§ischen marktes bei der nachfrage nach gas zu erh√∂hen. zudem soll eine ""kosten-nutzen-analyse"" f√ºr die deckelung der gaspreise f√ºr den energiesektor vorgelegt werden. die staats- und regierungschefs nannten keinen zeitrahmen, wann die entscheidungen √ºber die preisobergrenzen fallen sollen. 

die ratingagenturen moody's und s&amp;p global wollen am freitag entscheiden, ob sie die kreditw√ºrdigkeit von gro√übritannien herabstufen. damit k√∂nnten die finanzierungskosten des staates mitten in der regierungskrise steigen. 

der bundestag stimmt heute nach einer debatte √ºber den 200 milliarden euro schweren abwehrschirm gegen die sprunghaft gestiegenen energiepreise ab. dazu soll der in der coronavirus-pandemie geschaffene wirtschaftsstabilisierungsfonds (wsf) reaktiviert und bef√ºllt werden. 

adidas muss seine gewinn- und umsatzerwartungen zum zweiten mal innerhalb von drei monaten deutlich zur√ºckschrauben. der gewinn aus dem fortgef√ºhrten gesch√§ft werde in diesem jahr nur noch bei 500 millionen euro liegen, teilte die nummer zwei auf dem weltmarkt hinter nike mit. das w√§re ein r√ºckgang um zwei drittel gegen√ºber dem vorjahr (1,49 milliarden). 

deutsche bank hat einem insider zufolge mitarbeiter aus dem emissions- und beratungsgesch√§ft im investmentbanking in new york entlassen. das institut baut wegen des schwachen gesch√§fts mit √ºbernahmen und fusionen personal ab, wie eine mit den pl√§nen vertraute person sagte.

pne - die us-investmentbank morgan stanley pr√ºft einen verkauf ihres 40-prozent-anteils an dem deutschen windparkentwickler pne. das cuxhavener unternehmen best√§tigte entsprechende informationen von insidern, √ºber die die nachrichtenagentur reuters berichtet hatte.

credit suisse - im skandal um mutma√üliche manipulationen am devisenmarkt hat die krisengeplagte schweizer gro√übank vor einem us-geschworenengericht einen sieg errungen.

credit suisse trennt sich von ihrer beteiligung am madrider technologieunternehmen allfunds 53,9 millionen aktien sollen nach bankenangaben in einem bookbuilding-bieterverfahren verkauft werden. 

sika - der schweizer bauchemiekonzern hat in den ersten neun monaten erneut ein rekordergebnis eingefahren. der umsatz zog auch dank akquisitionen um 16,6 prozent auf 8,0 milliarden franken an, wie das unternehmen mitteilte. der gewinn kletterte um 15,8 prozent auf 765,1 millionen franken. sika konnte gestiegene rohmaterialpreise durch preiserh√∂hungen teilweise wettmachen und senkte die kosten weiter. 

der snapchat-mutterkonzern snap hat sein niedrigstes umsatzwachstum seit dem b√∂rsengang vor f√ºnf jahren verzeichnet und damit seine aktie auf talfahrt geschickt. der foto-messengerdienst machte eine zur√ºckhaltung der werbekunden angesichts der hohen inflationsrate f√ºr die entwicklung verantwortlich. ""wir erwarten, dass das operative umfeld in den kommenden monaten weiter herausfordernd bleibt"", hie√ü es in einem brief an investoren.

dem us-kurznachrichtendienst twitter droht einem medienbericht zufolge nach der √ºbernahme durch tesla-chef elon musk ein massiver job-kahlschlag in den kommenden monaten. die ""washington post"" berichtet unter berufung auf dokumente und interviews, dass musk knapp 75 prozent der rund 7500 twitter-mitarbeiter loswerden wolle. 

l'oreal - starke nachfrage in europa und den vereinigten staaten hat den umsatz des kosmetikkonzerns im dritten quartal um 9,1 prozent auf 9,58 milliarden euro steigen lassen. 

vivendi- das franz√∂sische medienunternehmen hat im dritten quartal den umsatz auf vergleichbarer basis um 0,6 prozent gesteigert, unter anderem dank starken wachstums der werbetochter havas.
    
galeria - nach der k√ºndigung des sanierungstarifvertrags des warenhauskonzerns durch das management will die gewerkschaft verdi verhandlungen mit der unternehmensleitung aufnehmen. 

in japan sind die kernverbraucherpreise im september so schnell wie seit acht jahren nicht mehr gestiegen. wie aus offiziellen daten der regierung hervorging, stieg der kernverbraucherpreisindex (vpi) f√ºr das land, der √∂lprodukte einschlie√üt, aber die preise f√ºr frische lebensmittel ausschlie√üt, im vergleich zum vorjahr um 3,0 prozent. 

ungarn w√ºrde einem hochrangigen berater von minister pr√§sident viktor orban zufolge einen etwaigen erdgas-preisdeckel der eu nicht mittragen. sollten sich die anderen eu-staaten auf einen solchen schritt einigen, m√ºsste es wie bereits beim √∂l f√ºr sein land beim gas eine ausnahme geben, sagt balazs orban der nachrichtenagentur reuters.

der wirtschaftsverband bga kritisiert vor dem hintergrund des ukraine-krieges das lieferkettengesetz. ""die gr√∂√üte gefahr f√ºr den freien handel ist derzeit nicht der russische krieg gegen die ukraine, sondern das deutsche und das europ√§ische lieferkettengesetz"", sagte der pr√§sident des bundesverbandes gro√ühandel, au√üenhandel, dienstleistungen (bga), dirk jandura, der ""rheinischen post"".

1666550517,"i think imperial brands ($imbby) and blackstone ($bx) are great growth stocks with a lot of potential and a good dividend. imperial brands has a large portfolio of tobacco brands and products with a lot of international exposure, they also own familiar names like backwoods cigars and cohiba, which is a high end brand of cuban cigars. the company also owns blu vapes and pulze heated tobacco, which is also a somewhat emergent sector in the tobacco industry. i also think imperial brands has potential to merge or be bought out by a larger firm. 

as for blackstone, they are constantly buying and aquiring new ventures, and they have expsoure to a lot of sectors everything from motel 6 to bumble and a lot of realestate, you get a lot of bang for your buck with blackstone. 

just my thoughts, there's also a lot of great etfs out there like jepi, schd and one i don't think that gets as much attention as it should but schp as well, which is an inflation protected bond etf with a monthly dividend.

if some investigative journalist digs a little, it will be found that some advisor to truss supports putin/oligarch who pushed her to make a catastrophic decision.

&gt;trickledown economics has been pushed by an entire generation of economists

so, because putin didn't invent the nuclear weapon+dirty bombs, it's not possible that he's now threatening their use to extort any country opposing him? why do former kgb agents care if they aren't original? do you think when they torture, there is pause when one suggests waterboarding: ""komrade, you know that's been done before."" 

putin wants to break the back of nato. if he can weaponize enough citizens of each of those countries, they will be too busy fighting w/in the country to pay attention to little ole putin/russia ... as it attempts to reacquire former lands of ussr. 

keep focus on putin. remove from power by any means. russia will have to be crushed, divided and relieved of all nuclear technology for russia's unlawful actions.",10,,Liqerman,0

1667142887,"yes, a stock closing above its 40 week moving average and having high volume is nice.

it's not enough to base a trade on.

and it's not accurate. 

the last trading day showed $jpm volume was less than its average volume. 

&gt;volume	11,731,419
&gt;avg. volume	12,685,098

it hasn't traded above that avg. volume since oct. 21st which was a one day spike.

any big volume it has seen has been in spikes, not in a consistent trend.

and, no surprise, most of those spikes have happened during volume spikes in the overall market or happened because of catalysts like earnings.",1,,stockpreacher,0

credit suisse taps rbc, morgan stanley for capital increase -bloomberg news

reuters

oct 18 (reuters) - credit suisse group ag¬†(csgn.s)¬†is working with banks including royal bank of canada (rbc)¬†(ry.to)¬†and morgan stanley¬†(ms.n)¬†on a potential capital increase, should it need to shore up its balance sheet and raise funds for its restructuring, bloomberg news¬†reported¬†on tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

a capital increase through a possible share sale, under the name project ghana, could come after the bank's formal restructuring announcement on oct. 27, the report added.

the report said that credit suisse, one of europe's biggest banks, would likely seek at least $2 billion to cover restructuring and any operating losses over the next couple of years as it pivots the business.

the swiss bank is¬†trying to recover¬†from a string of scandals, including losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of investment firm archegos last year, when it also had to suspend client funds linked to failed financier greensill.

analysts at¬†goldman sachs last week said¬†the capital shortfall could be as large as 8 billion swiss francs ($8.03 billion) by 2024. they saw the bank facing ""headwinds"" including weak markets and an investment bank they said lacks scale.

credit suisse and morgan stanley declined to comment. royal bank of canada did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.

earlier, reuters reported citing a source that credit suisse has approached at least one middle eastern sovereign wealth fund¬†for a capital injection, while some funds are looking at the scandal-hit bank's businesses as potential investment opportunities.",6,,SpiritTalker,0

1667230815,"just a note, and this in no way diminishes op‚Äôs excellent post. jpm is regarded as the best bank in america, if not the world. however- this places jpm squarely on the ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù list of banks (you can look the current list up). this matters because when the poop hits the fan because the government can and will require banks on this list to suspend or reduce dividends, buy backs, and so on. banks outside of the tbtf list generally skate free. what does this mean? the dividend may be less safe when you need it the most - an economic calamity.
