[what qe did was push rates so low that anyone who had any savings earning interest was essentially forced to invest into stocks.  before 2008 it was common to have a mix of bonds and stocks.  this absolutely pushed stock prices to record highs.    we've been on a 40+ year trend of lower and lower rates.  when rates hit 0 and it wasn't enough, the fed basically went out and bought tons and tons of mortgages to push those rates lower too, driving up re prices and prices of \*everything\*.  when people realized they could refinance their houses that had doubled in value at sub 3% rates for 30 years, they did it, in droves.    where did all that money go?  everywhere.   it kinda broke the system with inflation.    now the fed has stopped buying mortgages (so their rates jumped) and is also being forced to normalize rates due to inflation.    where it all ends up is hard to predict, but the setup this time around is looking rather grim.  as long as inflation remains elevated, the fed cannot implement policies to help asset prices without causing more inflation.    let's look at some numbers.  the 2019 low for the s&amp;p was \~2585.  the 2008 low was \~735.  we are now at 4132.  this is some scary shit.  the probabilities of major components of our financial system just breaking in the next few years is quite high.](/r/stocks/comments/ufmoo1/saying_last_decades_bull_run_happened_because_of/i6uwqhp/)

[this will probably get buried but.    i am going to keep my comments limited to my area of expertise which is commercial real estate.  i have 12 years experience with a fortune 200 commercial re firm where i advise folks on the purchase and sale of approx 2bn of commercial real estate per year and analyze about 5bn in detail in the process.  in my career i have read 100s or 1000s of cmbs loan agreements and worked on 1000s of properties encumbered by cmbs mortgages  you have no idea what you’re talking about and i am afraid the fact that this is one of the top posts in this subreddit speaks volumes to the quality of content on here.  cmbs mortgage payments do not vary based on the occupancy of a building and cmbs mortgage payments are not added to the end of the loan.  the payments are fixed the same as any other loan except they are much stricter in terms of on-going reserves and cash flow sweeps for example starting x months before any major tenant lease comes up for maturity.  if you are unable to make the debt service on your cmbs mortgage it will go into special servicing and they will sweep your cash flow not just allow you to pay less on the mortgage.  where did you get this idea?  you posted a video of one small retail sub market that’s not well occupied and you’re extrapolating that video to all commercial real estate property types nationwide to say that occupancy is low?   if property values fall below outstanding loan balances such that owners are underwater true we will see them stop paying their mortgages and hand back the keys to the banks or special servicer but this isn’t happening.    the typical cmbs mortgage is 60% ltv at the high end at the beginning of the loan and although many times have a couple years or full term interest only the balance if anything decreases over time so it will take a big decrease in value for defaults to occur  and the value of a commercial property is not directly linear to occupancy.  vacant buildings still have value.  due to the rapidly changing environment brought about by covid and growing e-commerce many properties are more valuable vacant vs leased so you can tear them down and build industrial.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uflx06/the_2022_real_estate_collapse_is_going_to_be/i6vnudp/)

1651422349,"wrong, although trump spent more then obama, bush didn’t spend as much as obama and biden is on pace to out spend all of them. the fed buying bonds leads to rampant inflation as we are seeing now.
new york, feb 10 (reuters) - the u.s. federal reserve should stop buying bonds immediately to contain rampant inflation, a top investment manager at blackrock (blk.n) said on thursday, joining a chorus of wall street heavy hitters and investors who have been calling for swifter fed action to contain rising prices. 
 again, as the fed prints money to buy bonds, it leads to inflation. the u.s also borrows money t pay its debt. as they try and pay off debt, democrats increase taxes to try and pay off the debt instead of reducing government spending. as they increase taxes, it takes more money out of the economy. as inflation goes up, people have less money to spend on non essential items slowing down the economy. that’s why there was a 1.4% shrink in gdp. 
  and when obama did quantitive easing, he gave the money to rich banks and corporations. democrats act like they want to soak the rich, but in reality it’s their rich friends who contribute to them. jeff bezos, bill gates, george soros and warren buffet are huge democrat donors. do you really think democrats will bite the hand that feeds them? 
  it’s simple, if democrat policies improved the economy, why did the gdp shrink after we are emerging from the covid lockdowns and people are looking to get back to normal spending? the answer is democrat policies have lead to higher prices and high energy costs.",1,,Boofstick981,0

so think of giving your stock a 9% boost by waiting 12 months to sell.  add the espp discount and it's ~19% more profitable.

these revelations, which one expert called “disturbing” in an interview with vox, came after a vox investigation showed how management consulting firms such as bcg and mckinsey have become ubiquitous in global public health organizations, despite the concerns of many health practitioners about multimillion-dollar price tags, potential conflicts of interest, and the opaque nature of consulting work.

[well, i’m 50. been investing for around 28 years, made a lot more in my 40s from my job than ever before.   the biggest mistakes i made were   1. pulling out of the market after losing around 25% in 2008 and missing part of the bull market that followed.   2. pulling out of the market after the 2020 tech stock crash (to be fair i had a sizable down payment in a house i didn’t want to risk)  selling my old companies stock as soon as i could (it went up 2000% in 10 years and if i’d held i’d have double what i ended up with).   so…most of my mistakes were not keeping my money in the market.   maybe this one is different….i’m down about $500k in my portfolio across the last 7 months or so.   don’t sell it all now? i’m fi but not re. i’d love to retire in two years but probably need another 20-25% more.   i’m holding for now. pared down some of my tech exposure a couple of months ago. but that’s about it. i’m 5% cash and dollar cost averaging in.   what else can i really do?](/r/stocks/comments/ufxal8/the_stock_market_is_the_greatest_tool_to_build/i6wvxlw/)

[there is no office reit etf - you're going to be short a lot of other subsectors of reits too. csgp has their 10x marketplace for commercial re, which will probably be put to more use if there's more distress in commercial property.  hasn't really worked out (perhaps early) but the second half of the dan loeb thesis for costar/csgp from early 2021:  ""a few months ago, costar embarked on ‘act 2’ of its journey with a vision to build the “nasdaq of cre” – a transactional marketplace where properties can be bought and sold online. to enable that vision, costar recently acquired ten-x, the world’s largest cre auction website with 90% market share. we believe ten-x unlocks a transformational revenue opportunity for costar. real estate is the us’ largest spending category but has been the slowest to move online (nearly $1 trillion of cre transaction volume annually, 98% of which is done offline).   as online penetration grows, ten-x’s dominant share suggests it will be the largest beneficiary, with a revenue opportunity 3x-4x larger than costar’s entire business today. and while ten-x’s auction platform has always offered a compelling value proposition for owners and brokers (particularly in the underserved long tail of smaller cre transactions), its penetration was historically constrained by weak distribution.  encouragingly, though, our research suggests it has experienced dramatic traffic growth during the past few months as costar has started to cross-sell the ten-x platform into its much larger installed base. as ten-x scales, we believe costar should be able to accelerate revenue growth from mid-teens to 20% and drive ebitda growth from 20% to 30% over time.  **finally, we believe costar will be a material beneficiary of impending covid-induced disruption in the cre market. as has been well-publicized, covid is expected to drive unprecedented changes in demand for office space (via relocation &amp; de-densification), hospitality/retail real estate (due to tenant distress), and other cre sectors. however, the resultant market impact has been delayed by a combination of government stimulus and long-duration commercial leases. as underlying demand disruption becomes more evident, we believe cre arms vendors like costar will benefit from the increased need for property advertising (to lease vacant spaces) and transactional platforms (to buy/sell distressed properties).**""](/r/stocks/comments/ughit8/longterm_bearish_on_commercial_buildings_offices/i70c3qj/)

[what qe did was push rates so low that anyone who had any savings earning interest was essentially forced to invest into stocks.  before 2008 it was common to have a mix of bonds and stocks.  this absolutely pushed stock prices to record highs.    we've been on a 40+ year trend of lower and lower rates.  when rates hit 0 and it wasn't enough, the fed basically went out and bought tons and tons of mortgages to push those rates lower too, driving up re prices and prices of \*everything\*.  when people realized they could refinance their houses that had doubled in value at sub 3% rates for 30 years, they did it, in droves.    where did all that money go?  everywhere.   it kinda broke the system with inflation.    now the fed has stopped buying mortgages (so their rates jumped) and is also being forced to normalize rates due to inflation.    where it all ends up is hard to predict, but the setup this time around is looking rather grim.  as long as inflation remains elevated, the fed cannot implement policies to help asset prices without causing more inflation.    let's look at some numbers.  the 2019 low for the s&amp;p was \~2585.  the 2008 low was \~735.  we are now at 4132.  this is some scary shit.  the probabilities of major components of our financial system just breaking in the next few years is quite high.](/r/stocks/comments/ufmoo1/saying_last_decades_bull_run_happened_because_of/i6uwqhp/)

[this will probably get buried but.    i am going to keep my comments limited to my area of expertise which is commercial real estate.  i have 12 years experience with a fortune 200 commercial re firm where i advise folks on the purchase and sale of approx 2bn of commercial real estate per year and analyze about 5bn in detail in the process.  in my career i have read 100s or 1000s of cmbs loan agreements and worked on 1000s of properties encumbered by cmbs mortgages  you have no idea what you’re talking about and i am afraid the fact that this is one of the top posts in this subreddit speaks volumes to the quality of content on here.  cmbs mortgage payments do not vary based on the occupancy of a building and cmbs mortgage payments are not added to the end of the loan.  the payments are fixed the same as any other loan except they are much stricter in terms of on-going reserves and cash flow sweeps for example starting x months before any major tenant lease comes up for maturity.  if you are unable to make the debt service on your cmbs mortgage it will go into special servicing and they will sweep your cash flow not just allow you to pay less on the mortgage.  where did you get this idea?  you posted a video of one small retail sub market that’s not well occupied and you’re extrapolating that video to all commercial real estate property types nationwide to say that occupancy is low?   if property values fall below outstanding loan balances such that owners are underwater true we will see them stop paying their mortgages and hand back the keys to the banks or special servicer but this isn’t happening.    the typical cmbs mortgage is 60% ltv at the high end at the beginning of the loan and although many times have a couple years or full term interest only the balance if anything decreases over time so it will take a big decrease in value for defaults to occur  and the value of a commercial property is not directly linear to occupancy.  vacant buildings still have value.  due to the rapidly changing environment brought about by covid and growing e-commerce many properties are more valuable vacant vs leased so you can tear them down and build industrial.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uflx06/the_2022_real_estate_collapse_is_going_to_be/i6vnudp/)

[why is bx stock crashing while rents are sky rocketing? it seems like this business strategy would be sound in 2013, when the re market was bottomed out. now that are paying all time highs for property and putting them out to rent for way more than people can afford.   isn't this alone evidence of cracks in their business model? they are paying 2x a property's value and it will take them years if not decades to recoup that investment.](/r/stockmarket/comments/ufi552/how_the_next_housing_crisis_will_happen_it_sure/i6u5ib7/)

[there is no office reit etf - you're going to be short a lot of other subsectors of reits too. csgp has their 10x marketplace for commercial re, which will probably be put to more use if there's more distress in commercial property.  hasn't really worked out (perhaps early) but the second half of the dan loeb thesis for costar/csgp from early 2021:  ""a few months ago, costar embarked on ‘act 2’ of its journey with a vision to build the “nasdaq of cre” – a transactional marketplace where properties can be bought and sold online. to enable that vision, costar recently acquired ten-x, the world’s largest cre auction website with 90% market share. we believe ten-x unlocks a transformational revenue opportunity for costar. real estate is the us’ largest spending category but has been the slowest to move online (nearly $1 trillion of cre transaction volume annually, 98% of which is done offline).   as online penetration grows, ten-x’s dominant share suggests it will be the largest beneficiary, with a revenue opportunity 3x-4x larger than costar’s entire business today. and while ten-x’s auction platform has always offered a compelling value proposition for owners and brokers (particularly in the underserved long tail of smaller cre transactions), its penetration was historically constrained by weak distribution.  encouragingly, though, our research suggests it has experienced dramatic traffic growth during the past few months as costar has started to cross-sell the ten-x platform into its much larger installed base. as ten-x scales, we believe costar should be able to accelerate revenue growth from mid-teens to 20% and drive ebitda growth from 20% to 30% over time.  **finally, we believe costar will be a material beneficiary of impending covid-induced disruption in the cre market. as has been well-publicized, covid is expected to drive unprecedented changes in demand for office space (via relocation &amp; de-densification), hospitality/retail real estate (due to tenant distress), and other cre sectors. however, the resultant market impact has been delayed by a combination of government stimulus and long-duration commercial leases. as underlying demand disruption becomes more evident, we believe cre arms vendors like costar will benefit from the increased need for property advertising (to lease vacant spaces) and transactional platforms (to buy/sell distressed properties).**""](/r/stocks/comments/ughit8/longterm_bearish_on_commercial_buildings_offices/i70c3qj/)

[what qe did was push rates so low that anyone who had any savings earning interest was essentially forced to invest into stocks.  before 2008 it was common to have a mix of bonds and stocks.  this absolutely pushed stock prices to record highs.    we've been on a 40+ year trend of lower and lower rates.  when rates hit 0 and it wasn't enough, the fed basically went out and bought tons and tons of mortgages to push those rates lower too, driving up re prices and prices of \*everything\*.  when people realized they could refinance their houses that had doubled in value at sub 3% rates for 30 years, they did it, in droves.    where did all that money go?  everywhere.   it kinda broke the system with inflation.    now the fed has stopped buying mortgages (so their rates jumped) and is also being forced to normalize rates due to inflation.    where it all ends up is hard to predict, but the setup this time around is looking rather grim.  as long as inflation remains elevated, the fed cannot implement policies to help asset prices without causing more inflation.    let's look at some numbers.  the 2019 low for the s&amp;p was \~2585.  the 2008 low was \~735.  we are now at 4132.  this is some scary shit.  the probabilities of major components of our financial system just breaking in the next few years is quite high.](/r/stocks/comments/ufmoo1/saying_last_decades_bull_run_happened_because_of/i6uwqhp/)

[haha.    ok, so all those people who were goaded into buying “the biggest home they could afford” because re was a great investment for the past decade - who took the biggest mortgage the banks said they could afford - and now are paying ~10-20% more for basic living expenses?  surely those people losing money month after month will take comfort in their 2% mortgage, right?](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uhd36n/who_else_thought_they_were_going_to_be/i75pfi8/)

may 3 (reuters) - the cost to insure bonds of goldman sachs (gs.n), morgan stanley (ms.n) and citigroup (c.n) against default hit two-year highs on monday on growing fears the u.s. federal reserve's aggressive moves to tame inflation might tip the economy into recession.

credit risks have worsened since the ukraine crisis as some big u.s. banks took a hit to their mainstay businesses, with capital market activity coming to a standstill and lending expected to remain lackluster.

that has prompted bondholders to consider hedging strategies to protect against potential defaults.

the war in ukraine and western sanctions could knock more than 1% off global growth this year and add two and a half percentage points to inflation, the oecd has said.

1651856849,"&gt; in a proposed class action filed in delaware chancery court, the orlando police pension fund said delaware law forbade a quick merger because musk had agreements with other big twitter shareholders, including his financial adviser morgan stanley (ms.n) and twitter founder jack dorsey, to support the buyout.

&gt; the fund said those agreements made musk, who owns 9.6% of twitter, the effective ""owner"" of more than 15% of the company's shares, requiring a three-year delay in the merger unless two-thirds of shares not ""owned"" by him granted approval.

i'd love for this to work but they've got some work to do to show he's ""the effective owner"" of more than 15% of the company. also, they haven't shown that twitter shareholders are harmed by the fast buyout.",11,,LurkerFailsLurking,0

his second investment thesis is population needs.   all of his investments are “brain dead” business as the operator hopefully cant do much to ruin the business.   you have products and services are somewhat inelastic or have pricing power.   

you need insurance and the government requires you to have.   you need gasoline.  you need to consume sugar, snacks, and go to the grocery store.  you want stuff that needs to be moved by the cheapest thing, by rail and last mile delivery.   you need banking services, terminal processing, and credit cards.   basically all his investments are positive cash throwing off business.  

now just compound these dividends for next 60 yrs, paid in usd off course, then you will be a billionaire.  the key is his wealth doesnt get wiped out in the bad years, while he collects cash from all his business, especially term life insurance and deploy new capital as efficient as possible, ie what is onsale during a crash.  buffett made a killing during the 2009 crash.  he loan big money to $gs as first preferred lending at $90/share.

buffet is a just “micro-tolling”.  he owns business that should exist in a crash with pricing power.  he wants dividends first then growth, which protects the share prices.  his investments aggregates all of this micro transactions in the economy and that equals billions dollars of profits.",0,,EmmaFrosty99,0

[that is an interesting definition, but i don't like that it puts it in non-rational terms. if you take a company ""i love"", let's say msft, it isn't because i have some kind of affection for msft (like i have a hat, t-shirt and other msft swag, lol). it is because i believe it is a company that has a strong market position, with no foreseeable risks for it to radically underperform the market as a whole. so, if i am going to be in the market at all i will be in msft, and would sell it only due to an unforeseeable event or because the market was so bad that the losses i believed i was almost certain to suffer would be greater than the capital gains tax i would have to pay by selling. on the other hand, one can rationally sell stocks where one believes that it is a good company caught in a general downturn, but that there are factors that make its recovery (at least in stock price) more uncertain, for instance that it was very overvalued to start with (in its own right and relative to the market) that it has an uncertain moat that could erode before stocks recover in general, or there is geopolitical risk that could change its fortunes as a company while it was beaten down by the market in general.](/r/stocks/comments/up8oi2/bofa_strategists_say_investor_exodus_signals_true/i8lmt9a/)

[a reasonable bear scenario (and i'm thinking not-so-soft-landing here) would be the vicious cycle of economic stagnation leading to lower tech spend and consumer discretionary spend.   consumer isn't a huge fraction of ms revenue and the smallest by operating income in q4 2021 and q1 '22](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2021-q4/segment-revenues), but there's pass-though risk in that clients who ultimately service consumers may contract.   that said, i'm not quite so sure how recession proof gaming is (it's not a large fraction of their profits/revenues anyway), but i agree that office is probably fairly recession resistant. azure is kind of a question though, i could easily see customers leveraging the rapid scalability of the cloud in the negative sense to shrink their operations if/when their businesses contract (this goes for all cloud providers). there's obviously a lot of moving parts here, but it's reasonable to at least consider something of a perfect storm scenario (just to rationally assess risk) and scale expectations.  like all other tech though, i'd argue that there's also the consideration that this is a market that likes to punish tech valuations if they don't absolutely blow out performance numbers and project significant growth.  edit: i should mention i'm an msft shareholder](/r/stocks/comments/uoxxe4/ko_and_other_value_stocks_are_overvalued/i8jggph/)

he financed the original deal by selling tesla stock, the value of said stock dropped, and he lost $25 billion in the bitcoin crash.

the opening arguments podcast [went into the weeds about that and a lot of other issues with this deal](https://openargs.com/oa595-shareholders-sue-twitter-alleged-facts-jeopardize-musk-deal/) including a [lawsuit from shareholders about some possible shady dealings on musk's part](https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-twitter-are-sued-by-shareholder-over-44-bln-takeover-2022-05-06/):

&gt; in a proposed class action filed in delaware chancery court, the orlando police pension fund said delaware law forbade a quick merger because musk had agreements with other big twitter shareholders, including his financial adviser morgan stanley (ms.n) and twitter founder jack dorsey, to support the buyout.

1652823034,"stocks exist as tools for capital acquisition for businesses. the purpose for businesses going public and selling ownership stakes (shares of stock) is to bring in money to help further grow or refine/improve the business. 

this is why businesses which are thriving will often do buybacks when they feel that they’re currently under valued and have more cash than they presently need to allocate to increase revenue. essentially, they’re setting themselves up for future raising of funds by obtaining more to sell, while also contributing to the share price going up. naturally, it would be idiotic to buy back if they felt they were over valued or didn’t have a good amount of cash on hand, so this is generally a pretty straightforward decision for them to make, and sends a pretty clear signal about internal forward view. 

also, “wall street” isn’t a single entity. broadly, the term refers to groups who allocate capital within the asset market space. by and large, most of their holdings are ownership stakes in businesses.

[stocks exist as tools for capital acquisition for businesses. the purpose for businesses going public and selling ownership stakes (shares of stock) is to bring in money to help further grow or refine/improve the business.   this is why businesses which are thriving will often do buybacks when they feel that they’re currently under valued and have more cash than they presently need to allocate to increase revenue. essentially, they’re setting themselves up for future raising of funds by obtaining more to sell, while also contributing to the share price going up. naturally, it would be idiotic to buy back if they felt they were over valued or didn’t have a good amount of cash on hand, so this is generally a pretty straightforward decision for them to make, and sends a pretty clear signal about internal forward view.   also, “wall street” isn’t a single entity. broadly, the term refers to groups who allocate capital within the asset market space. by and large, most of their holdings are ownership stakes in businesses.   in other words, it’s generally in wall street’s best interest for businesses they hold stakes in to thrive, driving up the value of wall street’s ownership stakes. retail participation is generally beneficial for them.   all of this to say, your friend is assigning failure to understand that near term volatility is normal, but *everybody* wins when the market goes up at a rate when business earnings roughly align to earnings growth.   simply put, if jpm stock goes up in the long term, the company, other investment groups on wall street, and me all win. it’s not adversarial as people imagine. many people simply pick strategies which require specific near term direction, lose, and need someone to blame.](/r/stocks/comments/urt1wa/the_street_vs_wall_street_an_investing_psychology/i8zwvaq/)

[depends on your strategy.  if you look for gappers to trade each day then no.  futures are unique and in my opinion you really need to specialize in a narrow spectrum.  equities (es, nq, rt), treasuries, or precious metals for example.    i don’t think you’ll be successful trading es one day, the oil the next, then gold after that, then the. 10 yr treasury the next day.   but, if you are day trading spy then futures will futures will simply amplify you gains/losses.  you can still use the exact same trading strategy](/r/daytrading/comments/us3ho0/futures_vs_stocks_day_trading/i91izhi/)

1652971574,"[i'm not concatenating. not sure where you're getting that from. it seems like a word with a lot of letters that has nothing to do with what i said.   analysts have been really wrong/off-base during any bubble related to evolving market conditions. look at all the a-rated mortgage backed securities in the financial meltdown of late 2000's.   analysts have been way off base &amp; trying to play catch up since the pandemic began. they were behind the curve and many investment pros, funds &amp; analysts were underperforming retail investors in 2020 &amp; 2021. then, they tried to catch up to retail by developing adjustment factors for their models in ""esg"" &amp; ""social sentiment"" factors, reading wsb &amp; scraping reddit for ticker mentions. now, they're following retail off a cliff because they can't stop talking about tech/growth stocks almost all day, every day, even though most of the retail community they follow &amp; try to factor in don't care whether their stocks go down 50% if they expect the stocks will be higher in the next 25 years from now.   the most recent example of analysts being out of touch and off in the wrong direction was wmt's big market shock yesterday, where for some reason many are just now figuring out that margins matter, because that's how inflation will begin to force its way through the economy. if retail cannot keep its margins up, it will have to raise prices even more, and wages will have to go up if spending is constricted due to prices, and the inflationary spiral will become entrenched. that's the wmt surprise shock that's currently caught analysts by surprise, that is taking down the market today.  i'm not sure who would listen to analysts right now, if you don't understand their model and their strengths and weaknesses. this is exactly the kind of market where buffett's saying about how you can tell who's been swimming naked when the tide goes out is true. this does occur at the investment bank level, as evidenced in jpm vs ms in the latest earnings report.  &gt;  retail should not be taking reports out of context anyway.  i totally agree with this.](/r/stocks/comments/us9wnx/target_profit_hit_hard_by_high_costs_inventory/i93aakb/)

[stocks exist as tools for capital acquisition for businesses. the purpose for businesses going public and selling ownership stakes (shares of stock) is to bring in money to help further grow or refine/improve the business.   this is why businesses which are thriving will often do buybacks when they feel that they’re currently under valued and have more cash than they presently need to allocate to increase revenue. essentially, they’re setting themselves up for future raising of funds by obtaining more to sell, while also contributing to the share price going up. naturally, it would be idiotic to buy back if they felt they were over valued or didn’t have a good amount of cash on hand, so this is generally a pretty straightforward decision for them to make, and sends a pretty clear signal about internal forward view.   also, “wall street” isn’t a single entity. broadly, the term refers to groups who allocate capital within the asset market space. by and large, most of their holdings are ownership stakes in businesses.   in other words, it’s generally in wall street’s best interest for businesses they hold stakes in to thrive, driving up the value of wall street’s ownership stakes. retail participation is generally beneficial for them.   all of this to say, your friend is assigning failure to understand that near term volatility is normal, but *everybody* wins when the market goes up at a rate when business earnings roughly align to earnings growth.   simply put, if jpm stock goes up in the long term, the company, other investment groups on wall street, and me all win. it’s not adversarial as people imagine. many people simply pick strategies which require specific near term direction, lose, and need someone to blame.](/r/stocks/comments/urt1wa/the_street_vs_wall_street_an_investing_psychology/i8zwvaq/)

but after saying all that, i think it wouldn't harm to hear gates go over his time as ms founder in an earnest way and actually reflect if he has done something wrong. he won't do it because that would potentially harm ms stock (and he might even be legally bound to not disclose some things), but that might still be a good cleansing thing to happen.

historically, in situations like this where people are starting to drown in their own col and debt is they'd use their home as an atm to pull out cash to weather the storm until things stabilize, but home/heloc lending has tightened to the point that a lot of these people aren't going to be able to draw on that - and even if they can, the interest rate is going to be a problem.  which puts them either in a position that they cash out (which raises a whole new set of problems i.e. migration to cheaper areas to buy a new house or downgrading to becoming renters) or simply defaulting on anything non-essential to maintain the mortgage and deciding they're exiting the credit markets for 7 years.  bankruptcy isn't even on the table for homeowners, because the value of their properties have skyrocketed so much that they have too much equity for a homestead exemption.  house rich cash poor.  but it doesn't take a genius to figure out if you sell and pay your debts, at that point you're just poor.

ms have really stuffed this up

**grey strip**

a huge number of my sp365 site homepages now have the grey bar along the bottom of the banner image. these are all ootb images from the ms stock library, so they have done something and broken it.

**broken focal point**

i have also noticed that some of images from the ms stock library no longer go up-down when setting the focal point. even though the image selected is large and a 4x3 dimension (say a group of people standing) i only get a cropped thin banner (of their heads) and i can't roll the image up-down, only left-right.

to go back to your post...i think gs stock split is another one of the boards predictably weak strategies to try and keep the stock price unsustainably high. perhaps they genuinely believe the split will give them time to figure out a master plan that would actually transform a poor firm into an ok one...i don't buy that.  they couldn't care less, and are trying to maximize their end game, not the investors or gamestop. they want gs as cheap as possible so that youngsters will speculate on it.
