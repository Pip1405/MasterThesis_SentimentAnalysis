1654106797,"i love calendar spreads especially since they introduced 3 dte options.  it is a real institutional type trade to sell otm options and the volume often confuses rookie traders when looking at the option chain because they think those otm options are being bot when in reality they are being sold.  $wfc is one stock where a lot of the popular trading is not directional but instead negative delta.  calendars on $spy can make real income fast like 10-20% a week.  sell this week and buy next week or sell next month and buy 3 months out.  you have to do a lot of testing on a good platform like tos to fully comprehend but it ‚Äúcan be‚Äù less stressful than being long  deltas.

long verticals i don‚Äôt use.  short verticals i use too but not often 

as a secret, if you ever see a 1 by higher number bull call spread or bear put spread and wonder what that‚Äôs all about remember 1 by higher numbers are usually protective and not directional (as an example) a 1 by 5 bull call spread would typically be an institution buying that spread to protect a short position",1,,Independent_Row_Goes,0

1654254477,"&lt;&lt; san francisco, june 3 (reuters) - tesla (tsla.o) ceo elon musk has a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and needs to cut about 10% of jobs at the electric carmaker, he said in an email to executives seen by reuters.

the message, sent on thursday and titled ""pause all hiring worldwide"", came two days after the billionaire told staff to return to the workplace or leave, and adds to a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders about the risks of recession.

musk has warned in recent weeks about the risk of a recession, but his email ordering a hiring freeze and staff cuts was the most direct and high-profile message of its kind from the head of an automaker.

""musk's bad feeling is shared by many people,"" said carsten brzeski, global head of macroeconomic research at dutch bank ing. ""but we are not talking about global recession. we expect a cooling of the global economy towards the end of the year. the u.s. will cool off, while china and europe are not going to rebound.""

musk's gloomy outlook echoes recent comments from executives including jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) ceo jamie dimon and goldman sachs president john waldron.

a ""hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way,"" dimon said this week. &gt;&gt;

1654795484,"alrighty vitards, i have an exciting experience ahead of me. i got a field assignment with my company to help build the largest powerline in america out in ut/co/wy for 6 months starting july. some interesting facts about the project: it will require 57,300,000lbs of steel (2.5 eiffel towers) and 3,900 miles of conductor (almost as long as the amazon river). 

but since i'll be out on the right-of-way all day, my ability to actively trade will be hampered. i'm looking to reposition this month into some 6 month holds and looking for suggestions. 

right now i'm thinking: $zim/$gsl, $arch, $amd/$qcom/$tsm, $bac, and $oxy/$vet/$cve to get exposure to a little of everything. what are some other stocks i should look into for a 6+ month hold? thanks!",13,,Skywalk88,0

there is apple stock, and ms stock. it's that simple. how did that happen? because both companies made and to continue to make computing accessible to people who don't care about the gnome project. because they don't have to. 

they don't have to care about devs leaving projects because of adwaita or some shit. all they care about is how to get apps and services. on devices that actually work, unlike the pine phone. 

they don't want to have people shout ""read the goddamn wiki!"" when their os breaks. they spent money on hardware and software. why? because what's being sold off of shelves is supposed to work, and brand loyalty is a thing in case anyone doesn't realize that simple concept. 

people that resent success probably haven't achieved much of that on their own, and torvalds himself can come off like a very prickly person, but he's not a total marxist either. he just doesn't sell hardware to own that percentage of the marketshare, or have oems reluctant to use linux to ship on their hardware because of devs leaving projects because of fucking adwaita.",2,,DickNDiaz,0

1655496206,"fyi - i appreciate your responses, and, no, i took no offense when you told me to not do this. i knew this instinctively too of course, it just gutted me to watch my recent ""moves"" go down in smoke and i felt like throwing in the towel. i knew the prices last fall were crazy overvalued on many large caps, but seeing the prices drop i dunno, 20% in march on some stocks i had been eyeing made me feel like a kid in a candy store.... and like the luckiest guy in town. i bought google, boeing, salesforce, paypal, danaher, $jpm, $ice... and averaged down some others i had owned that were seemingly on-sale. i guess i underestimated how far things could drop even if i thought i had picked wisely and at attractive entries. in fairness, i do trust their cfas a lot more than myself to find value, so i tend to stick to their buy recommendations. so i wasn't swinging blindly. i think i'll do okay in the long term, but i do plan to slowly pivot to indexing (as i do in my retirement accounts). i guess it looks bad on paper, but since i'm not selling, hopefully future me will be happy i took the swings.

i work in tech myself, which is crazy since i've been so tech light. i guess in hindsight it was a positive thing to be overweight in energy, but light in tech. my core position in my brokerage is $ice, $googl, $ba, $luv, $tpr... and those energy stocks i'm overweight in. indexing is something i'm much better suited to, as i don't want to watch tickers, i just want to dca into something and set it and forget it. i lack the financial chops, and i'm humble enough to admit while i'm smart... i'm not smart enough to beat the big boys.",1,,nexusmoonshot,0

1655761882,"‚Äúbanks are not allowed, however, to announce their plans for dividends and buybacks until the following monday, june 27.

the country's largest lenders, particularly jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n), citigroup inc (c.n), wells fargo &amp; co (wfc.n), bank of america corp. (bac.n), goldman sachs group inc (gs.n) and morgan stanley (ms.n) are closely-watched by the markets.

the fed devised this year's scenario before russia's invasion of ukraine and the current hyper-inflationary outlook.

still, the 2022 test is expected to be more difficult than last year because the actual economic baseline is healthier. that means spikes in unemployment and drops in the size of the economy under the test are felt more acutely.

for example, the 2021 stress test envisioned a 4 percentage point jump in unemployment under a ""severely adverse"" scenario. in 2022, that increase is 5.75 percentage points, thanks largely to rising employment over the past year.

as a result, analysts expect banks will be told to set aside slightly more capital than in 2021 to account for expected growth in modeled losses.

stresses in commercial real estate, corporate debt
this year's tests will also include ""heightened stress"" in commercial real estate, which was hit by the pandemic as workers were sent home, and corporate debt markets. global watchdogs, including the international monetary fund, have warned of high levels of risky corporate debt as interest rates rise globally.‚Äù",2,,BikkaZz,0

my hunch is that as long as wealth/economic growth occurs then these institutions will grow alongside with it. t rowe‚Äôs revenue growth was pretty low - averaging 10% a year since 2012

edit: t rowe‚Äôs forward pe is probably closer to around 11-12ish. trailing pe is 8 as their eps is falling from $13 at the 2021 peak to $10-11",5,,DMVganggang,0

**jpmorgan agrees to pay $15.7 mln to settle spoofing lawsuit**

washington, sept 23 (reuters) - jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) agreed to pay $15.7 million in cash to settle a class action lawsuit by investors who accused the largest u.s. bank of intentionally manipulating prices of u.s. treasury futures and options.  
  
the settlement disclosed late wednesday night stemmed from sprawling u.s. government investigations into illegal trading in futures and precious metals markets, known as spoofing.  
  
jpmorgan did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which covers traders in treasury futures and options from april 2008 to january 2016 and requires approval by a federal judge in manhattan.  
  
last september, jpmorgan entered a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $920 million, including a $436 million criminal fine, to settle u.s. government probes into spoofing in treasuries and precious metals. the bank also agreed to self-report future violations.  
  
spoofing is a practice in which traders place orders they intend to cancel, hoping to move prices to benefit their market positions. the justice department has employed sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential spoofing that it could not previously detect.  
  
the $15.7 million payout would recover less than one-third of the estimated classwide damages, a court filing shows. lawyers for the traders plan to seek up to one-third of the settlement, or about $5.2 million, to cover legal fees.",2,,Upvotes4Trump,0

1656346719,"""**u.s. prosecutors explore racketeering charges in short-seller probe -sources**

by megan davies and chris prentice

register now for free unlimited access to reuters.com

new york/washington feb 18 (reuters) - u.s. prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia, in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks, according to two sources familiar with the situation.

the justice department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including such well-known names as citron research and muddy waters research llc, as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors, reuters and other media have reported. 

while prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (rico) were an option on the table, the sources said.

in the past, prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.

reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.

spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u.s. attorney's office in los angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.

*citron declined to comment.*

a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

the potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department's unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime.

a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said.

but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. that's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.

among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told reuters.

in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company. 

prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said.

they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, reuters previously reported.

rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented.

**u.s. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals.**

""rico statutes haven‚Äôt been used in this realm often in recent years, but they aren‚Äôt limited to organized crime,"" robert frenchman of mukasey frenchman llp in new york said. ""it‚Äôs certainly in the prosecutors‚Äô toolbox."" ""

1656433860,"unless he has an unmodded pal console to test the game there's no guarantee it would work. 

chances are he's using a modded xbox himself and even if he region changed it to pal it would not guarantee it would play ok on an unmodded pal xbox. however if it didn't display properly on a pal region set (modded) console then it certainly won't play correctly on an unmodded pal one. 

to test it properly he'd have to remove his softmod and replace it with a pal ms stock one - nobody is going to want to do that. 

the obvious solution is to softmod your pal xbox then, most of the time, it won't matter whether the game is ntsc or pal. if there is a region locked game then it is a simple matter of temporarily changing the console to that region.

most pal users mod their xbox because it avoids these sorts of issues but also because you only get the ed/hd display options when using a ntsc dashboard.",1,,DeliverKindness,0
