1643146384,bank of america &amp; wells fargo stock correlation (01/25/2022),"Hi everyone!

I was looking at some stocks on the FinViz map and I noticed something so I decided to take a look for myself.

[Bank of America 1 day chart \(01\/25\/2022\)](https://preview.redd.it/jt5j1r5giwd81.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90856be04f71b0adaf2e668abd0c9c3f6fd3f47c)

Take a look at the chart of BaC for today.

Now, I want you to take a look on Wells Fargo's chart from today.

&amp;#x200B;

[Wells Fargo 1 day chart \(01\/25\/2022\)](https://preview.redd.it/jzqd9bbniwd81.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c04e228f0d56873577c7c6c795d3907ae9797a0a)

Do you see what I see? This makes me wonder if theres any stock in the market that isn't manipulated.

Also, why do they do this? Why would they want their charts to be almost identical. Is this proof that they are working together to keep their shit show up? I don't have much wrinkles so would appreciate if some wrinkle brains could elaborate on this matter.

All I know is GME is going to MOASS. LFG!",15,4,haasecsgo,GME
