deutsche ceo had said exit 'would go against our values'

investors criticised deutsche's russia presence

ceo's 2021 pay up 20%

frankfurt, march 11 (reuters) - deutsche bank (dbkgn.de), which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to russia, said on friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.

deutsche joins the ranks of goldman sachs (gs.n) and jpmorgan chase (jpm.n), which were the first major u.s. banks to exit after moscow's invasion of ukraine. those moves put pressure on rivals to follow. read more .


deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in russia.


but on friday evening in frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.

""we are in the process of winding down our remaining business in russia while we help our non-russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.

""there won't be any new business in russia,"" deutsche said.


a day earlier, deutsche bank's chief executive christian sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.

""the answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""we have clients who cannot exit russia overnight.""

bill browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in russia, said that deutsche bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the west.""




""i would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" browder told reuters earlier on friday.

the criticism came as russian forces bearing down on kyiv were regrouping northwest of the ukrainian capital and britain said that moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days. read more 

fabio de masi, a former member of the bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that deutsche bank had close ties to the russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal russian activity, had to end.


deutsche bank has said that it has pared down its russian footprint in recent years. this week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". read more 


it also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in russia and opened a new main office in moscow in december, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the russian market"".",1,,Tane-Tane-mahuta,0

1663299946,"wow, there's a lot to unpack here, but a few things stand out.

first and foremost, his startup business.  this is a huge wildcard.

**how much is the company worth?  don't agree to anything until you're sure you know the answer to this question.**

valuing a business for purposes of divorce can be a very tricky and contentious issue, but it's super important because, as you've pointed out, there's the potential it could be worth a huge amount of money\*.\*  do [some research](https://marinercapitaladvisors.com/resources/business-valuation-issues-in-divorce), and ask your lawyer how to go about establishing a value for your husbands share of the business.  also, you'll probably want to get a copy of the stock agreement your husband has that gives him an interest in the company.  it'll have details about how many shares he has and what the rights and obligations are that goes along with that. (e.g. whether the company has a buy-back option)

it wouldn't surprise me at all if you were pleasantly shocked at how high that # is.  especially since your husband doesn't seem to want you to have any part of it in his offer to you.

(also, has your husband said anything about them actually having an ipo?  i ask because that would imply the business is worth several orders of magnitude more than anything else you've mentioned here.  like, 10s or 100s of millions of dollars... :-/ )

one thing to be aware of is that being entitled to 1/2 your husband's share of the company gives you a lot of leverage in negotiations.  for a small company, the prospect of having an ex-spouse hold an interest in the business presents an almost existential problem.  because what you're splitting is your husbands shares, not just the dollar amount.  and those shares likely represent a voting-interest.  holding those would make you a partner in the business, which would be all kinds of awkward for the other founders.

anyhow, definitely do your homework here.   and if you can share specifics about the nature of the business (what's the product / service they offer?  have they taken investment $$$ from anyone?  how many founders?  how many employees?  etc.)  i or someone else here might be able to offer further insight into how significant this is.

net result:  there's no way to value this aspect of your agreement at this time.  it could be worth $0, or it could be worth $ms.

\---

okay, next up is the house.  he's asking for is ""only"" 10% of $500k (the value of the home) but that makes it sound somewhat better than it is.  what really matters here is the equity you have in the home: $300k.  but you need to factor in selling costs, which typically knocks off \~15%.  so what your husband really wants is \~20% of the equity.

if the loan is in your name only, that's a good thing. mortgage rates are climbing rapidly - a trend that's likely to continue for the foreseeable future - so refinancing would be expensive\*.\*

net result: your husband is making a \~$90k concession here.

\&gt; he could pay for some thing to show that i can work full time

yeah, it's called ""imputed income"".  you can google it, but basically a court isn't interested in what a person's actual income is, what matters is what they can reasonable expect to make should they choose to work.  (mostly used for deadbeat spouses who claim they have no income because they're just too lazy to find a job.)

i wouldn't worry too much about this but, yes, a court will probably rule that you have the capacity to work full time at some reasonable level of income.

net result: 'might affect the support amount, but hard to ascertain by how much.

\---

\&gt; he pays 1 year alimony

after a 22 year marriage?  hmm... definitely talk to your lawyer about this.  the rule of thumb is that support runs for \~1/2 the duration of the marriage.  $800/month x 11 years is \~$105k.  your husband only wants to pay for 1 ($9.6k)

net result: you're conceding \~$96k here

\---

\&gt; apparently in our state a judge could rule he pays for life

use this for negotiation if need be.  ""for life"" is an awful long time, and potentially worth a lot of money.

\---

&gt;car (paid off worth about 50k in value)

net result: husband making \~$25k concession

\---

&gt;keep my retirement so no 10% penalty hit having to divide it up

check with your lawyer, but i believe retirement funds can be split in a divorce without incurring any costs.  you just need to provide the fund manager with a [qdro](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/whats-qdro/) when requesting the funds be split.

\---

&gt;not sure i should take it (if it were legal to do so and lawyers on both sides agreed it was legit).

it's not really a question of legality or legitimacy.  your husband can offer whatever he wants, and you're welcome to agree to it or not.  as long as you're not being coerced or obviously being taken unfair advantage of, a court will let you do whatever you decide.

overall, i would not take this offer at this time.  it's not actually all that generous, and you're giving up a huge potential windfall (???) in the form of your interest in your husband's business.

the first order of business for you needs to be getting a good handle on how much this business is worth.  until you do that, you simply can't evaluate how good or bad any offer your husband makes is.",2,,duhvorced,0
1663311891,"banken schwunghandeln? jetzt rein in $gs oder $jpm und nächste woche raus wenn zinsen wieder hoch?kann docj gar nicht so blöd sein oder?🤡 hab keine lust mich mit dem sektor zu befassen, aber die zwei sind doch ganz knorke oder",2,,Visible-Coach,0
1663333209,"&gt;i get half of it.. and the company does well and lets say it was worth a couple mil.. would he still have to pay me alimony too?

yes.  it would be unusual for a divorce decree to alter a person's obligation based on the future outcome of some risk that's been taken.  for example, if you keep the home and it gains or loses value, that wouldn't affect spousal support.  divorce decrees are based on a snapshot of your present-day situation.  you and your ex are expected to understand the risk associated with whatever assets you keep or give away, and be okay with that.

speaking of which, where your interest in the company is concerned my advice is that you **not** end up with shares in the business.  that's unlikely to be a good outcome for you, your stbx, or the business.  having you as a part-owner isn't really a good idea for a variety of reasons.  early-stage investors in businesses typically bring more to the table than just money.  they have contacts, resources, and experience that are of real benefit to the business.  you don't have that.  worse, having you involved would likely be a drag on your stbx's motivation to see the business succeed, which would have a ripple effect within the company, and make the odds of success for them less likely.

the best outcome there is for your husband to find a way to buy you out of your share of the business so the business can proceed to operate without too much disruption.  what you want is to be compensated for an amount that feels ""fair"" *today*, knowing that if the business fails you cashed out early and came out ahead, and if the business takes off... well... you still came out ahead, and will (hopefully) be happy that your husband's gamble paid off.

i've seen both sides of this, by the way.  cofounders that got divorced and gave up a lot in the settlement agreement (e.g. a house and/or retirmement accounts) to buy their spouse of their share of the business.   for one it worked out - those shares ended up being worth $ms.  for the other, not so much; the business shut down a few years later, leaving them with nothing to show for it.

it's part of the gamble that comes with being a startup entrepreneur.

oh... which reminds me of another reason why you don't want to have a share in the business:  it's counterproductive to good financial management practices.  shares in a startup are so risky, so volatile that they're impossible to incorporate into a traditional financial plan.  you have to effectively value them at $0 because too do otherwise is insane.  e.g. if you invest or take out loans in the hope you'll get a windfall payout from the business in 5-10 years, 9 times out of 10 you're going to wind up bankrupt.

so, for you, those shares are a bit of a poison pill.  you would be much better off having assets that are easier to work with.  stocks, bonds, retirement accounts, real estate... things that a financial planner (which you should probably have if you don't have one already) are familiar with, and know how to incorporate into a traditional portfolio.

'hope this helps.",2,,duhvorced,0

alan lowenthal (d) ca sits on the transportation committee

his wife made some well timed trades on boeing, $ba
on mar 5 2020 she sold ~30k of $ba shares
one day later his committee releases damaging findings on the 737 jet
$ba went onto fall 35%+ in a week

(again) alan lowenthal (d) ca sits on the natural resources committee

his wife perfectly played two rallies on sunrun $run
nov 2019, bought ~$30k @ $14.50
feb 2020, sold ~45k @ $21
mar 2020, bought back in @ $9 
&amp; sold 78 times as the stock ran to $80
thats a cool 780% return


john rose (r) tn sits on the financial services committee

he sold shares of wells fargo, $wfc, a few months before his committee issued a critical report on the bank
11/12/19 - sold ~250k of $wfc @ $54.22
3/1/20 -  report’s published
$wfc tanked 30% a week later to $37


mike kelly (r) pa
his wife bought ~$50k of $clf just one day after being briefed that the commerce dept. launched an investigation to benefit the company
she bought at $4.70 and sold at $18.11, a 300% gain
interestingly, this was the only individual trade she made that year


richard burr (r) nc sits as the head intelligence committee
on 2/13/20 him &amp; family liquidated their entire portfolio and went into treasury bonds
one month later the $spy had its fastest 30% decline in history
this saved him $300k+ in possible losses


the wildest part about all of this though is that thousands of every day employees aren't allowed to trade individual stocks, consultants can’t do it. bankers can’t do it. even many reporters can’t do it. yet the most influential people in the country, our politicians, can and that is just some of it. but ya retirement and saving for 40+ years allow our politicians to make millions lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo



also a week ago the nyt posted an investigation into politicians trading stocks

they found that 81 democrats &amp; 101 republicans filed up to 3,700 trades and $100m in possible volume

many had 100% winners, with some perfectly timed

here’s examples of just how good they were.

first, of those 182 politicians, 90+ sat on committees that directly oversaw the companies they traded

49 were democrats
44 were republicans

which totals 18% of congress


25% of the energy &amp; natural resources committee traded $xom or $cvx

33% of the environment committee traded oil-field services

8 members of the armed services committee traded defense/aerospace stocks",0,,officernasty13,0

put simply: pension funds in the uk have been spicing up their annuity income via ldis, which involve using hedges and swaps (packaged up kindly by investment banks) in order to generate leveraged positions across junk bonds, mortgage backed securities (mbs), and so on. 

these ldis are

a) full of stuff that is priced off gilts (uk treasury bonds)

b) using gilts as collateral.

unfortunately, gilt prices are crashing. for a whole bunch of reasons relating to the uk fucking up, inflation, qt etc. but also because everyone is dumping gilts in order to maintain those fancy swaps and hedges and stuff. and the uk is being led by a parade of absolute fools. 

so - this is leading to a vicious circle of forced selling. as asset prices drop, margin calls happen, gilts get sold, gilt prices go down, everything reprices, .... more margin calls happen. of course not only gilts are getting sold, but they're getting sold *first*, whereas mbs etc junk bonds etc will get dumped en masse at the end. 

and i think this is having knock on effects on the us treasury markets; those of you long tlt will know what i'm talking about. 

the boe said it would not step in to fix the market till november. the next day they suddenly announced they would buy £65 billion of gilts above market price and pass the losses to the uk treasury / taxpayer. 

""hmmmm.""

i assume the goal is to slow or stop an epic-scale industry-wide synchronised margin call wrecking the pound, government debt, investment banks, mbs, junk bonds, etc. and a related credit freeze up in the style of 2008.

so you might want to have a little think *right now* about how much of these you have:

- anything that got turbo-fucked in 2008.

- investment banks likely to be counterparties in this trade in the uk, eu or us

- uk pension funds &amp; fund manager firms and life assurance firms

- mbs and junk bonds

- uk gilts, maybe t-bonds and euro t-bonds

£65 billion isn't *that* much, at the scale of pension funds of an entire country.

previously, i was hoping to buy options in $jpm around $100.... that's now a nope.
