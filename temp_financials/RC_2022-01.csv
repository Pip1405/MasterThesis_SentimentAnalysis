look at $u (unity software) if there is a pullback. 

for semiconductor, consider $on for chips in auto. nvidia is great too but i feel it's a crowded trade and needs to pullback.  

i also like $a (agilent), $dis (disney), $axp (american express), and ual (united airlines).

1641247953,"interesting question, but the difference isn't worth a bucket of warm pee.  the real question is why would you bother to own bank of america stock.  (i know, i know--  nomb.)  

in theory, bank of america, because its yield is taxed at a higher rate (as foreign income--  that is, at your marginal tax rate). however, the boa yield is currently only 1.89%, so if you're in a 30% tax bracket, that's only 0.57%, or $57 per ten thousand invested.

td has a higher yield (3.26%) and it's taxed as a canadian dividend, which in that bracket would be about 9% in ontario, or 0.29%, iow $29 per ten thousand.  the difference (0.28%) is $28 per ten thousand dollars invested.   could get yourself a nice pizza for that once a year i guess.",3,,Strix780,0

1641490014,"you can’t do that as an investor. we’re all morons that know nothing about anything. we try to read the tea leaves, but as long as human psychology drives the majority of market forces there’s only speculation. i actually have a master’s degree in finance and could show you the math (dividend discount model or residual earnings model, your pick lol) of what a stock “theoretically” should trade at depending on “fundamentals” and interpretations of that, but that’s not how the market operates. 

that’s why $gs is trading barely over 6x p/e while beating estimates and other companies have p/es in the 100s. 

do you like the stock? do you believe in the stock?

1641513508,"just downloaded another copy and did a little culling. this is what i usually do every month to see if there are some things i'm interested in looking more into.

i culled all otc stock (over the counter), and then i removed anything that did not have at least a 7% dgr for 1yr, 3yr, 5yr. there is a 5yr/10yr a/d (5yr vs 10yr dgr acceleration/deceleration ratio). anything &gt;1.0 is good. this indicated that the average dgr yoy is either at least staying the same (=1.0) rising (&gt;1.0). i will copy/paste to make a 3yr/5yr as i prefer to see how it compares to those. sometimes there were some issues 5+yrs ago that didn't allow them to raise the dividend so the 5yr/10yr a/d is low but the 3yr/5yr looks great and they are raising it. i also personally like to give a little wiggle room so i look for anything that is &gt;0.9 a/d ratio for the 3yr/5yr.

doing just this in about 30 seconds i was able to see that there are approx ***138*** equities on the list. then you can just start culling through all the fundamentals. i'll start by removing things with high p/e levels, negative earnings/revenue, and negative growth and etc. typically i can get down to about 20 decent looking holdings on paper. then i'll head to seekingalpha or something, make a portfolio and then look into ratings, debt, what the share price appreciation and performance and returns have been. it's a great way to build a portfolio.

i put a good bit of time into this. also, another good way to find decent holdings is looking through $dgro $schd, and some other really high rated dividend growth stocks. they do a ton of research so their top 10 or 20 holdings are typically helpful to start with.

\*\*added - if you remove anything with &lt;2.5% yield here is the remaining 27 holdings. you'll need to look into their fundamentals but this could be something to look into.

1641840571,"k, i'm not going to run a vpn for xcloud streaming, and i almost, i mean almost, went down a rabbit hole of by passing my home3000 router for the vague promise of blowing $300 on a new wifi router and a sfp media convertor (or ubiquti router w/ sfp), when its not clear what the real issue is. 

if it's a bell route, i would hope microsoft would maybe contact bell and have them route traffic properly. netflix and everyone else is on top of the largest market isps, colocating and setting up backbone agreements. if its the home3000, and i don't know why it would be really, what am i supposed to do? replace a router that works perfectly for everything but this? i'm not using bell's tv or voip services. i disable all qos crap and i run cat6 for pretty much everything. 

my comment about the xcloud app not including any diagnostic, ping, route hoping info, etc... all stands. it doesn't even come with a basic network test. the xbox at least will test internet connectivity and remote play capability. instead supposed i'm running wireshark to figure out what's going on. if ms doesn't care, i'm not sure why i should put all this time in.

like i said, it ran well enough in june, now it doesn't. my connection currently caps out in real transfer testing at 500/500. it can serve 2 stay at home students and 2 work from home parents with vpns, yet i can't view xcloud's piddly bit rate stream.

if its a routing problem, again, why is microsoft selling in markets without tooling to detect if there are service issues? every single xcloud app could be reporting back if there are quality issues. a devops person at microsoft can simply look and reach out to isps in question to resolve the issue.

anyways. i'll go back to sleep now. i own ms stock, so you guys enjoy xcloud on me. i'll forget it exists for another 6 months then maybe check back in. maybe it'll be gone or fixed by then. who knows.",1,,No-Opportunity-8875,0

and coinbase seems like the most trustworthy custodial solution (since they are fully compliant in the us, and just released ipo docs). so i can imagine they carry some weight with their users.

it's weird that people keep repeating ""multichain world bridges"" without actually having the technical skills to know if it's plausible. it seems to me like bridging/wrapping requires liquidity or trust. it also makes the attack surface for hacks much larger. so just like in normal technology it's not so simple to bridge apple, $ms and linux. it's just as hard in the blockchain but we also have large hacks, often happening to bridging and interoperability solutions.",2,,PresentCompanyExcl,0

1642194164,"(again) first let me say i hate this company.  second, i love money more so i'm playing this hard.

3 part thesis:

* i began this position back in june of 2020 because it had dropped ridiculously low.  it's basically made that recovery.  i've closed several call positions ranging from -50% up to nearly +400%.

* near term strategy is the rise in interest rates.  rate sinsitivity is highest for wfc amongst peers, bank of america is also a good play for rate increases.   $wfc has run since the new year for this reason, and i believe there is still upside based on interest rates.  (earnings was not part of this strategy, but holy shit did it pay off.)  **i'm expecting another bump right before or at an actual increase.**

* long term strategy is removal of the fed imposed asset cap.  $1.9 trillion asset cap imposed in 2018 for the sales/account scandal.  the bank has made public progress toward meeting the requirements for lifting the cap, but they are not there yet.  i'm *hoping* this will be lifted q3-q4 2022, if not, i'll roll everything out to 2023 as this will provide a *serious* boost to share price.  **after the earnings call, i thinking the cap will be removed no earlier than 2023, so i'll likely start buying leaps even further out.**


i will continue to buy on any dips.

pelosi came from a shitload of money and she bought her way into her position. she was very rich before she even got to congress.

the only congressperson that knows banking and wants to change it is elizabeth warren which is why she's a target.   the only person that knows more about banking is jamie dimon.

the most corrupt trader that is a member of congress by far is austin scott who uses his position on the subcommittee on commodity exchanges, energy, and credit to make bank.  scott has been number one for a while, but he is a nobody in congress so nobody knows who he is whereas pelosi actually has a lot of power.  scott is congressman for georgia.  


topped by him however was mnunchin under trump and then the fed regional director that recently had to resign.

[while i believe the bears do have a legitimate case against gamestop, being the challenges they have to meet and overcome are absolutely massive, they are far better positioned now than they were back in nov 2020, thanks to the hype around their stock.  but i do agree, there isn't much to look forward to and gamestop has been completely silent regarding their plans for the future, and the silence is not bullish imo. oh, judge rc by his actions and not his words? what exactly has he done thus far?  people have been hyping up a nft marketplace, but sentiment towards nfts is rock-bottom, especially from gamers who are highly skeptical of anything that even sounds like a microtransaction. apes can bury their head in the sand and downvote as much as they want, but it's not going to save their bags in the short term. i don't wish to see anybody lose in the market, but some people are going to learn the hard way as the market trends back towards caring about little things like fundamentals, as is clear by meme stocks taking the hardest beating in this bearish market.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s735xy/unpopular_opinion_gme_is_headed_for_50_before_250/hta1w3a/)

*jan 19 (reuters) - retail investors were less enthusiastic about buying the dip in u.s. stocks on tuesday, the latest sign of a possible fatigue after last year's tech-fueled trading frenzy, vanda research analysts said in a weekly note.

individual investors bought $1.6 billion in stocks on tuesday when u.s. shares sold off sharply after weak results from goldman sachs (gs.n) and a spike in u.s. bond yields.

by contrast, they had bought close to $2 billion on sept. 28 when the s&amp;p 500 fell 2%.

""retail investors bought a lot less than they typically would,"" vanda's ben onatibia and giacomo pierantoni said about tuesday's session.

""this could be the first sign that retail fatigue or capitulation is setting in, at least in the tech space.""

vanda's research note comes as enthusiasm around so-called ""meme stocks"" also appears to be fading, a year on from the gamestop corp (gme.n) frenzy when retail investors coordinated on online message boards to buy into heavily shorted stocks.

a report on friday showed young investors were losing interest in these ""meme stocks"", with gen z's attention shifting to companies in areas like electric vehicles and the ""metaverse"". read more

a large share of purchases on tuesday was concentrated in proshares ultrapro qqq (tqqq.o), a leveraged etf that targets three times the one-day return on the nasdaq 100 index (.ndx), helping cushion the blow from the massive institutional selling in the sector, vanda's analysts said.

even microsoft corp's (msft.o) bumper $68.7 billion purchase of ""call of duty"" maker activision blizzard (atvi.o), the biggest gaming industry deal in history, failed to cheer up retail investors. read more

retail investors were net sellers of activision on a day when its shares jumped 26%, the research house said.

buying in retail favorites, including tesla inc (tsla.o), apple inc (aapl.o), advanced micro devices inc (amd.o) and nvidia corp (nvda.o), has also diminished amid a tech sell-off that started last month, according to vanda research.*",2,,fountain-of-doubt,0

sure, acquiring company stocks can take a hit from debt transfer etc from the company being acquired but because they spent 70b yesterday didn't make them drop any more significantly than the board market (on a percentage basis) or compared to similar stocks.

the transaction also didn't talk specifically about the debt absorption so i'm not sure what blizzard carried but it did include their net cash.  honestly, i think a transaction of this size was largely priced into the stock price already so i'm not expecting to see significant downward pressure on the stock price honestly.  i do hold a fairly significant portion of ms stock in my porfolio so maybe i'm being optimistic.  who knows.",2,,munkyxtc,0

[i hold jpm and many of the other banks. you should know that jpm is at over 2x book value. most banks are  much better values. additionally, jpm is having struggles with costs. jamie dimon (jpm ceo) wrote a great article the other day about how fintech has an unfair advantage against traditional banks and he's right; the recent increase in employee salaries definitely weighed down their guidance for 2022.   my investment window is 2 years on it and i have faith it'll be a profitable investment by then. however, it does look like it will go down in the short term. if their book around $71 and falling, then the stock will likely test and fall below the 2x mark around $140. again, most other banks would be around $80-$110 if they had a book value of $71.   so short term down, mid term down to flat, and long term above $160.  edit: i'd buy ms, bac, or c instead. c is lagging but is at a price to book ratio of .7!!!](/r/stocks/comments/s7scny/jp_morgan_chase/htch6xk/)

1642809868,"your understanding is far better than most :) some corrections from what i remember:

the tranches used in cdos weren't just groups of mortgages, but *portions* of the mortgages. the first 20% repaid from 10,000 mortgages was put into a cdo, which basically said that once that was repaid, you get some premium over what you paid for the cdo. the 2nd 20% was similarly packaged, but you had to wait longer for it to vest, and it had a higher chance of defaulting, so the underlying investment was sold for less. but the reason this worked (for a while, and on paper) is the idea that people default at a predicable rate - 1% of subprime borrowers fail to pay off the first 20%, 5% fail the next 20%, etc. if one or ten or a hundred people suddenly go bankrupt, that's built into the price of the securities.

i think this is part of what op's video gets wrong - it definitely was not just speculative investors that caused the recession, but also very much 'high risk' mortgages (i.e., sub-prime). some notes on this...one of the biggest problems wasn't just that people *couldn't* pay back their mortgages, it was that they *shouldn't*, financially. if i borrow $300k for a home, expecting it to be $400k in a couple years, that seems like a good investment at almost any interest rate. but if suddenly that home is now worth only $150k, i have 2 options if i am not keeping the home: sell it for $150k and just pay $150k loss over however many years, or...walk away. mortgage debt was unique in that many states allowed borrowers to simply walk away, and absolve themselves of all responsibility for the loan and the house - the bank is stuck with the home whether they want it or not, and because they lent out $300k for a house now worth $150k, they are the ones stuck eating the loss. further, they never wanted to be in the business of home sales, so this becomes a huge hassle they never thought they'd need to deal with. this was complicated by the fact that because of the collateralization of the mortgages, it became very very hazy as to who actually owned the home - the loan was split into the tranches talked about above, and was part of say 5 different securities, and each of those was perhaps owned by various investment funds that knew absolutely nothing about home resale. 

the above was facilitated by failures pretty much everywhere. during clinton's term, there was a big push to make 'the american dream' available to everyone, and so the rules were such that lenders were incentivized to loan to otherwise unqualified buyers; those without a history of steady income, with few assets and no liquid capital. this allowed/incentivized lenders to lend to people with virtually $0 down payment, which made walking away from the homes a no brainer. the loan underwriters sold the loans to investment firms as you described, and the ratings agencies (which are government designated, but ostensibly private organizations) all said that while the mortgages were 'junk', the cdos created from them were aa or aaa in their stability. which makes sense without considering network effects.

i don't think cds's were put into cdo's, but one part cds's played you missed is risk requirements. banks are required to keep their 'risk' (how much they could lose due to market fluctuations) below some threshold, so if they have some number of cdo's on their books, they have to account for the chance those fail for some reason in this calculation, and it limits how much they can invest. along comes cds's, and someone says ""hey, i'm so sure that security will be fine, i'll insure it for you for a small price"". this allowed the banks to claim their risk exposure was mitigated - after all, what are the chances that both the mortgages and a large institutional insurer both default? which of course allowed them to invest more.

but wait, there's more! hedge funds also saw a chance for advancement, on the backs of the banks hardest hit. investors started to worry after lehman went under - individual funds were insured up to $100k by the fdic, but large institutional investors were not. if you had $10 million in some embattled investment bank, you were definitely wondering whether they were going to be able to provide that money back to you. people made a 'run on the bank', which further caused problems for the institutional investors. things sorta stabilized, until ultra wealthy hedge funds realized they could artificially signal the collapse of a bank by short selling. for example, morgan stanley (ms) is at $30 a share. it goes up or down a few cents each day, but stays about there. various hedge funds working in tandem want to force the price down to make clients of the bank feel their funds aren't safe. so the hedge funds borrow as much ms stock as they can get, and sell it on the market (short sale). other investors, scared of what they saw with bear and lehman, don't want to get stuck with large quantities of worthless ms stock, so after seeing the price go from $30-&gt;$29.5, they sell off their stock, just to be sure. which pushes it down to $29. more people see this, and they sell *their* stock as well. $28. a few large names get antsy, and pull their funds out of ms accounts; word of this gets out, and further frightens ms stock holders. they sell at $27. this cycle feeds in on itself. ideally for the hedge funds, ms goes under - they have to repay their stock, but if it's trading at $0.01, they made $29.99 (times a couple billion). this actually did happen, within a few hours, and led to the rules against short selling of financial institutions for some period of time.

in the end, there is enough blame to go around. lawmakers, regulators, the rating agencies, the lenders, the borrowers, the investment banks, the cds issuers, hedge funds, various businesses entering into the cds space when they had no business in that market (freddie, fannie), even large companies with high reliance on low priced credit (ford, gm)...all played a large part. saying it was just a few large banks cannibalizing the system 
is wrong.

source: worked at ms at the time; the above story happened, within a few hours. every person on my floor was just glued to finance.google.come, thinking...what happens if it goes to $0? do we just go home...? i saw when lehman went under - people were crying carrying boxes out of their building, with news crews focusing on each person as they went. ms pulled through in literally the last minute because of a large influx of cash from mufj (japanese bank). they stopped bonuses for all this period for obvious reasons, but gave out lots of stock to employees instead.",23,,rollie82,0

dak wanted big money and he got it. to claim that the scrutiny he’s receiving is unfair for not playing to what is expected of big money qbs in todays nfl is questionable. 

big money qb = big performances in big games; a lot of times, against big odds when the rest of your team is lacking leadership and needs that big money field general. 

he is none of those things in a fandom that desperately desires a sb run. the fans want sbs, not average qbs and coaches.

1643148902,"generally speaking, yes, microsoft promised to pay $69b for ab in one year. that $69b is paid out to the owners of the company. in this case, because ab is a public company, the owners are anyone who owns a share of ab. 

under this arrangement, individual shares will be converted either to cash or to shares of microsoft, depending on the arrangement of the buyout. for example, some companies pay all cash when acquiring another company, while some companies mix cash and stock, and other companies do an all stock transaction. regardless of the arrangement, if you own ab shares, the totality of all owned ab shares (aka the market cap) is now $69b minus a certain percentage due to risk of cancellation or block.

to make this easier to understand, say that abs market cap was originally $50b and that there are 1 billion shares outstanding. this means each share is worth $50. since microsoft agreed to buy ab for $69b, the total number of shares would stay the same, but each share would jump in value to $69 per share. it might only jump to $67 for now while the deal plays out, as there is a risk the deal gets cancelled or blocked. as the transaction date gets closer the $67 per share will slowly approach the buyout price ($69 per share). 

to answer your other question, mom and pop shareholders do not generally have a say in how much their shares are worth. depending on the companies ownership structure, only a certain percentage of shareholders need to sign off on an acquisition deal. so, even if you didn’t want the deal to go through, you will be overruled and your shares will be worth the agreed upon price. 

on the day of the transaction, ab stock will cease to exist and your holdings will be converted to either ms stock or cash, depending on the arrangement of the deal. 

hope that explains things.",1,,SolarSurfer7,0

that ppsh build is the most common and for a good reason. the mobility is too good to pass up, but unless you hit your shots every time, you're gonna run out of ammo quickly. this isn't a problem in snd tho. although the monolithic doesn't make sense. if you're looking to silence the gun, just use the other suppressors. the ads time penalty of the mono is too harsh. or you could ditch the suppressor for a light muzzle brake. this actually makes the gun viable at longer ranges rather than putting a mono suppressor on.",3,,FeelitMonsieurKrabs,0

as far as when to enter, it is extremely volatile right now.  i've sold a few of the shorter dated calls last week as the entire market tanked and reentered this week, and i'm just barely green on those new positions.  honestly, if you are willing to hold this for a while, buying leaps now wouldn't be a big deal, but stay away from anything less than 30 days unless you babysit it.  good luck and let me know how you do.",2,,TTTTsixandtwo,0
