1666188019,goldman sachs stock analysis (#gs),"Investment banking and asset management giant Goldman Sachs recently reported a big reorganization in their business, but what does that mean for potential investors?  Looking at the fundamentals, it's a mixed story.  

Although shareholders have been diluted a bit over the past few years and the company doesn't produce a huge amount of returns on invested capital, its income looks good and its dividend seems well covered.  Even with modest growth and valuation estimates, the stock looks like it is in buy territory based on today's prices.
