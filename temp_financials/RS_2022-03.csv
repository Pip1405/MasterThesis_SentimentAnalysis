1646163412,goldman sachs stock (gs) - potential bottom," 

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to point out a triple bottom I found along with unusual call activity in GS stock.

Check out the daily chart - there is support at $327. Three bounces this month, as well as additional bounces in Feb &amp; April of 2021.

After, check the 1min chart on March 1 2022. Multiple bounces at $327. This shows there is decent support here.

Additionally, my bot which tracks unusual activity from high-net-worth traders is showing call activity for the $327.5 strike.

I'm predicting a rally to at least $340, but potentially much higher.

Let me know your thoughts and feel free to check out my other predictions on my profile.

1646251502,update on gs stock - options up 66% after signal,"Hey everyone,

GS bounced off support today. I discussed this as a possibility yesterday [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/wallstreet_vision/comments/t4g9kt/goldman_sachs_stock_gs_potential_bottom/). Feel free to check out the analysis.

The stock continued bouncing on the $327 level today at open before going up around 2.5%.

Here's the daily chart as a reminder. My original price target was $340. As we approach that, I'm keep tracking of market sentiment to see if this a real bottom, or if we are heading lower.

IWM hit a double bottom at the $137 level. Other indexes made a new low while IWM only hit the previous low and bounced. So it will be interesting to continue watching here.

1647736977,seeking advice on funds currently in a morgan stanley stock plan connect account to grow for utilization in the next 1-2 years,"I was gifted stock from my company 4 years ago and it has grown considerably in a Morgan Stanley Stock Plan Connect account. I am 75% vested so I have 11K available and 25% that will be vested EOY. I'm considering pulling the 75% vested and putting it somewhere that is more diverse that can grow with the goal of using this money for future home purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have advice on this? My gut says to pull and diversify but I want to be able to use the money in the next 2 years.
