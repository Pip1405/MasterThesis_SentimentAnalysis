1643674832,"i personally use vwap + 8ema crossover on the m15 timeframe. 

my understanding is that the 3ema would just be an average of the previous 3 bars and 3 bars on the m5 make up a single m15 bar so a 3/8 ema cross on the is no different than seeing bars stack above above the 8ema on the m15. granted, the equivalent of an m5 8ema on the m15 would be a 2.6~ ema but i still find that the 8ema works well on the m15.
 
this eliminates some of the noise in the m5 and makes for a cleaner chart while still giving you the same signal. the caveat here is that the signal will be delayed but i see that as more of a feature than a hindrance as the trend is confirmed on the m5 and m15 by the time the crossover happens.

examples of this can be found in $axp, $intc. both of which i went long on today.",3,,Dankocracy,0

i just find the ""no google services"" critique, the main one being written, annoying, as it's coming from people who clearly haven't owned a post-us ban huawei phone. many of my friends who are tech illiterate installed it on their phone by their own. not just the play store itself, but the google play services that are required validation for various apps--most importantly payment services and whatnot, to work. it's a 2-minute process.

in many instances you can even buy variants of their devices with this service pre-installed by the store--like huawei mediapad m6 variants with gps pre-installed on aliexpress.

imo…the true motive for filing a class action suit was to gain access to nfl-wide related information through discovery. if the judge allows the case to proceed to discovery, we know from the kapernick case that nfl owners hate discovery, probably for very good reasons. there is doubtful any group of 32 human beings on the planet more arrogant and likely to release legally incriminating evidence in e-mails than nfl owners. they will buy flores, et. al. off at the earliest opportunity with a settlement just to stop the process. 

even if the judge dismisses the class action without discovery, flores has a great case against the giants if the belichick e-mail was genuine. it’s hard to believe belichick was careless enough to send such an e-mail after all his legal experience with deflate- and spy- gate, but he is one arrogant dude that just doesn’t believe the rules were made for him. in this case, he may have the pleasure of being interrogated by flores’s lawyers in discovery and possibly in court if it goes to trial. my guess is the giants will eventually settle for $ms to avoid a trial that publicly validated the sham nature of the interview with flores.  

it’s ironic that the giants (and possibly the nfl) are likely to pay $ms in a discrimination case that was made possible by the nfl’s modified “rooney” rule designed to prevent discrimination.  regardless, flores will likely have the “pleasure” of making the nfl and/or the giants pay dearly for their careless disregard of rules designed to promote equal opportunity for black coaches.",1,,Jlmcneill1955,0

meanwhile, $jpm has not been performing well. this must be concerning for their investors and jaime dimon who has much of his compensation wrapped up in $jpm options.

percentage wise, $jpm has a lot more downside room before it equals the red mj stock investors have suffered in their stock portfolios.

this whole denial by $jpm for its prime customers to trade cannabis stocks in november 2021 is very suspicious given that it was done a month before the safe banking act was conveniently removed by senator schumer from the national security authorization act which was a ""slam dunk"" bill always passed by congress. in fact, that's exactly what happened in december 2021. it passed.",2,,GroundbreakingLynx14,0

i didn't think about buying precious metals at that time. but i do remember the day jpm stock went to $18 a share and i didn't have a brokerage account.  this was way before retail investors with small amounts of capital could buy easily.  i eventually accumulated some at higher prices and cashed out quite well recently at $170 a share. the fact that it could have been a $152 profit per share still aggravates me. the same thing happened with boa when it went down to 4.80 midday in early 2012. it's $48 this week.  lesson? always have cash to buy the dip no matter what you're investing in.",1,,JadeWarrior777,0

congrats on all of it and being able to grow and find a dream job!

unfortunately, the words you write are starting to describe the manglement at my $workagency

we have the light versions of $dragonlady, $mrscott, and $badmike   
$dl - extreme fear of the corona, writes draconian policies accordingly  
$ms - bully management and encourages disparate treatment of staff  
$bm - moves goalposts and doesn't like giving raises

strange decrees trickle down that only affect certain team members but not others like how  
breaks are now staggered and nobody can eat lunch with other mates...  
no fireside/watercooler chats, no having fun, it's all werk werk werk, \*cracks whip\* 

i asked casually:  
which one do you want us to do, follow the rules or do our jobs?  
the rulemonger didn't like that... 

every week $mgmt asks - wow can we make things better?  
team proposes ways that will work to reduce customer headaches by using the crm to solicit updates to tickets

lot of hate for pfps, then pfps are the greatest. land/metaverse is the big speculation right now on solana, more subdued on eth. not even sure on one, tezos, etc. there is a fund doing it now. i can't imagine a years long strategy i would be confident in. 

if you want to get into something you could add metaverse coins that are integrating other nfts, but frankly this is all incubator level stuff. one day if $ms or someone else real serious and experienced with real ip were to swoop in this would all be trash.

if i could invest in something it would be to invest in the engineers. follow the successful ones. watch when a project gets big, bought out, and where the team is deployed to build next. run the hype train and get out.

i recommend going for 100 shares of $schd. then focusing on dividend stocks like $o/$mo, and mainstay growth stocks like $msft or $aapl that also have dividends. try to avoid overlapping stocks from similar sectors when possible. diversity is mostly about sectors, not just stocks in general.

he's not even in the top 10 shareholders.  
he owned a lot more a few years ago and has been slowly selling it off and moving elsewhere.  


he founded and built ms, but he is not tied to it in that way anymore.  
he was investigated in 2019 for allegations of harassment with a female employee and ms thought it best he step down from the board, which he later did citing his own reasons. he is not a part of their decisions at all. that's not how trillion dollar companies operate.

1645045401,"feb 16 (reuters) - morgan stanley's (ms.n) role in the collapse of archegos capital management deepened a probe by u.s. authorities into wall street's lucrative market for block trades, bloomberg news reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

the investment bank lost nearly $1 billion last year when bill hwang's archegos failed to meet margin calls, forcing several investment banks including morgan stanley to attempt recouping losses by liquidating shares and assets.

block trades were already under scrutiny when the highly leveraged family office imploded, the report said on wednesday.

morgan stanley, shares in which were down 2.3%, did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment.
broker-dealers frequently buy and sell blocks of shares, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy, which are large enough to move the company's share price.

block trading tends to increase during times of volatility as institutional investors rebalance their portfolios. information on such share sales ahead of time could be extremely valuable.

federal investigators began focusing on trades carried out by morgan stanley a day before the wider sell-off wiped out $35 billion from the value of archegos' holdings, bloomberg said.

that led to a wider inspection of multiple trades brought to market by morgan stanley, and whether its clients illegally profited from trading in advance of those transactions, according to the report.

it also led to scrutiny of pawan passi, a senior executive at the bank who spoke about various block trades, the report said.

reuters and other media outlets reported on tuesday that the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) was probing whether financial executives broke the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of large sales of shares. 

the sec subpoenaed financial institutions in recent weeks to ask about particular block trades, including some dating back to 2019, according to a source familiar with the probe.

the sweep appears aimed at the broker-dealers involved in the trades as well as protocols the firms have to prevent misuse of the information, the source said.",63,,kamoob666,0

you could build it as a series of web parts, or a series of power apps. i’d imagine you could work with netcom to pull data from dtms and whatever other systems ako pulled from, too. and the army is working on a byoad program for teams, so you could piggyback off azure ad and the rest of the existing infrastructure once that’s generally available. 

i think the a365 moal is a great example of pulling in data from a bunch of different dod systems to provide a strategic-level picture of something, as well as having the ability to drill down on individual users. you should be able to get to it from https://armyeitaas.sharepoint-mil.us, if you haven’t seen it already.",1,,[deleted],0

1645224573,"new york/washington feb 18 (reuters) - u.s. prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia, in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks, according to two sources familiar with the situation.

the justice department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including such well-known names as citron research and muddy waters research llc, as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors, reuters and other media have reported. 

while prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (rico) were an option on the table, the sources said.

in the past, prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.

reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.

spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u.s. attorney's office in los angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.

citron declined to comment.

a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 
the potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department's unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime.

a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said. 
 
but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. that's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.

among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told reuters.

in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company. 
 
prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said.

they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, reuters previously reported.

rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented. 
 
u.s. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals.

""rico statutes haven’t been used in this realm often in recent years, but they aren’t limited to organized crime,"" robert frenchman of mukasey frenchman llp in new york said. ""it’s certainly in the prosecutors’ toolbox."".

1645233223,"a racketeering case could allow prosecutors to ensnare a broad swathe of investors involved in an alleged ""criminal enterprise,"" even if they participated indirectly, lawyers said.

but such a case would also face more challenges than a narrower one aimed at a smaller group of people. that's in part because prosecutors have to establish a pattern of activity, they said.

among the activities the justice department is investigating is whether funds conspired to perpetrate a so-called ""short and distort scheme,"" sources have previously told reuters.

in such a scheme the funds would have placed trades that stood to profit if a company's stock fell and then issued false or misleading negative research reports about the company. 

prosecutors are also investigating the relationships between the short-sellers who publish the reports and hedge funds and other investors that may have profited, the sources have said.

they are examining whether there is coordinated trading designed to boost trading volumes and exaggerate price drops on news of the short reports, reuters previously reported.

rico charges have historically been used to combat bribery, money laundering, or drug trafficking conducted by organized criminal enterprises such as the mafia. they are unusual in the world of finance but not unprecedented.

u.s. prosecutors in 2019 charged then-current and former jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n) executives with racketeering and manipulating prices of precious metals.

1645236541,"&gt; new york/washington feb 18 (reuters) - u.s. prosecutors are exploring whether they can use a federal law originally enacted to take down the mafia, in a sprawling probe of hedge funds and research firms that bet against stocks, according to two sources familiar with the situation.
&gt; 
&gt; the justice department last year issued subpoenas to dozens of firms, including such well-known names as citron research and muddy waters research llc, as part of the sweeping probe focused on potentially manipulative trading around negative reports on listed companies published by some of their investors, reuters and other media have reported. read more
&gt; 
&gt; while prosecutors haven't made any decisions yet, potential charges under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (rico) were an option on the table, the sources said.
&gt; 
&gt; in the past, prosecutors have built rico cases alongside other allegations, such as manipulation. one of the most high profile cases brought under the rico act included that of michael milken, who was indicted in the 1980s for racketeering and securities fraud but reached a plea deal, pleading guilty to securities violations but not racketeering or insider trading.
&gt; 
&gt; reuters could not ascertain which types of charges the agency was leaning toward at this stage of the investigation or whether the probe would eventually lead to charges.
&gt; 
&gt; spokespeople for the justice department in washington and the u.s. attorney's office in los angeles, which are involved in the probe according to the sources, declined to comment.
&gt; 
&gt; citron declined to comment.
&gt; 
&gt; a spokesperson for muddy waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; the potential use of the 1970 law, which has not been previously reported, provides new insights into the scale and ambition of the investigation. the probe marks a new frontier for the justice department's unit in washington tasked with rooting out corporate crime.

check out avb, eqr, maa, ess for apartments (there are others too). o or nnn for business property.

if you want to make money from the main company that everyone complains about buying up all the houses (they are a giant company that also owns apartments and tons of other real estate, and then literally hundreds of billions of dollars of other stuff on top of that) you can just buy bx stock.",3,,lllll69420lllll,0

1645730274,"there are a lot of different segments to the semiconductor industry. generally you can separate them into three types of companies:

1. manufacturers. these are the companies that actually make the microchip devices: intel, samsung, micron, sk hynix, tsmc, etc. for top of the line, the industry has consolidated so that the the most advanced technologies are pretty much limited to the companies i just listed. there are a lot of chinese companies trying to catch up, but they're still several years behind, and are hampered by import restrictions as well. as you go to less state of the art, there are still a lot of companies working in larger features and on 200mm wafers, etc. these are things like analog devices, rf, etc, power, etc. are in this area. there is also a small niche in defense applications as well, since the us does not allow certain chips and technologies used in manufacturing advanced armaments (guided missiles, fighter aircraft, etc.) to be manufactured outside of the us. raytheon is a good example of this.  
work for these companies can depend a lot on where you are. working at a fab for their current production line can be stressful with long hours, because any delay or decrease in production means immediate revenue loss for the company. working on development of future nodes can be slightly less so, but you can still expect stringent deadlines and lots of stress to deliver on time.
2. tool suppliers. these are the companies that make the tools (i.e. giant machines worth $ms each) used in the high-volume manufacturing process. their customers will be the manufacturers listed above. some of these are really big companies with $bs in yearly revenue, but unless you're in the industry a lot of people have never heard of them. asml, applied materials, tokyo electron, lam research, and kla tencor are some of the bigger companies here.  
one of the difficulties of working for these companies is that their entire bottom line is determined by a few customers (i.e. the above companies) and possibly just a few hundred actual tools. so when the manufacturers stop expanding and buying new tools, the tool suppliers can suddenly see their entire revenue stream dry up.
3. material suppliers. these are the companies that manufacture and sell consumable items used in the manufacturing process. bulk chemicals, specialty chemicals, wafers, gases, etc. the purity requirements for the semiconductor industry can be absolutely insane, now &lt; 1ppb (part per billion) in some applications. this requires companies that have very specialized purification and metrology techniques to be able to fit these stringent requirements.  
margins and profits aren't nearly as high in this sector as it is for the tool suppliers, but it's a lot safer as well: whether the manufacturers are buying new tools or not, they are always going to be buying wafers and chemicals for current production, since their revenue is directly dependent on how many chips they are able to make.

in general it's important to understand the cyclical nature of the industry. it goes from boom to bust and back to boom again. the industry has been on a big boom cycle for the past several years, but it never lasts forever. when production outstrips demand, the price of chips crashes, the manufacturers see their profits drop precipitously, the tool manufacturers see all their future orders cancelled and all their revenue predictions dry up, and the whole industry has to tighten their belts and hopefully wait out the downturn.

different companies handle the downturns different ways. some will just go through fire/hire waves, while others will keep a lot of money in the bank to ride out the downturns. i've also seen a large increase in the use of contractors or temp labor that can be much more easily let go when needed.",13,,derioderio,0

feb 25 (reuters) - credit suisse group ag (csgn.s) is trying to help the u.s. department of justice potentially build a case related to block trading against rivals morgan stanley (ms.n) and goldman sachs group inc (gs.n), bloomberg news reported on friday.

the swiss bank's push to provide assistance apparently goes beyond banks’ routine cooperation with requests for information, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

credit suisse has delivered a presentation to the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york, flagging potential issues with the collapse of archegos capital management last year that led to billions of dollars of losses for global banks, according to the report. 

a representative for credit suisse declined to comment. 

the archegos meltdown drew regulatory scrutiny towards block trading, which refers to the practice of buying and selling blocks of shares. broker-dealers engage in block trading, either on behalf of clients or as part of a hedging strategy.
reuters reported last week that the u.s. securities and exchange commission was probing whether financial executives may have broken the rules by tipping off hedge funds ahead of such trades.

in a filing on thursday, morgan stanley (ms.n) said regulators and prosecutors in the united states were probing various aspects of its block-trading business. read more

washington, feb 27 (reuters) - u.s. banks are preparing for retaliatory cyber attacks after western nations slapped a raft of stringent sanctions on russia for invading ukraine, cyber experts and executives said.

tensions between russia and the west escalated on saturday as the united states and its allies moved to block some russian banks from the swift international payment system and placed curbs on the russian central bank's international reserves.

western governments have warned for weeks that the tensions could spark massive cyber attacks from russia or its supporters. some executives said the latest measures may be the trigger.

“there will be some retaliatory measures taken by them, and i think in the least costly way that they can do it - that means some kind of cyber attack,"" said steven schweitzer, senior fixed income portfolio manager at the swarthmore group in new york.

global banks, already top targets for cyber attacks in peacetime, are increasing network monitoring, drilling for cyber attack scenarios, searching their networks for threats and lining up extra staff in case hostile activity surges, according to cyber security experts.

among the threats they are preparing for: ransomware and malware attacks; denial-of-service attacks that take down websites; and data wiping and theft, possibly simultaneously.

“banks are incredibly prepared. they have taken out their playbooks and it's practice, practice, practice,"" said valerie abend, who leads accenture's global financial services security group.

the largest u.s. banks, jpmorgan chase &amp; co (jpm.n), citigroup inc (c.n), bank of america corp (bac.n), wells fargo &amp; co , morgan stanley (ms.n) and goldman sachs group inc (gs.n), either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to discuss their cybersecurity plans.

as guardians of critical national financial infrastructure, global banks are subject to strict operational risk rules and have some of the highest cyber security standards in corporate america, according to cyber experts.

the industry regularly plans for attacks and completed a massive, system-wide ransomware drill in november, according to the securities industry and financial markets association, which led the exercise.

leading up to the invasion, there has been a more concerted industry effort to ensure banks' incident responders are on high alert and that they had increased monitoring, abend said.

the new york department of financial services and the u.s. cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency have warned private companies to be vigilant for cyber threats.

""we wouldn't be doing our due diligence if we weren't preparing for that,"" said teresa walsh, global head of intelligence at the financial services information sharing and analysis center, an international group of institutions that share cyber intelligence.

“right now, they've been warning in generalities - just be prepared. we are trying to put some more specificity to it,"" walsh added.

walsh said banks have been brainstorming risk scenarios based on tactics russian hackers have used in the past. the 2020 solarwinds corp (swi.n)software breach that gave hackers access to hundreds of companies using its products, is top of mind.

that has increased lenders' focus on third-party providers such as big cloud and software-as-a-service firms. while banks themselves have big it budgets and strict compliance programs, if such providers are hacked their data could be exposed.

banks are urging such partners to ensure they have the right security protocols, according to walsh and abend.

they are also ""threat hunting,"" searching for known malicious behaviors inside bank it systems, examining potential vulnerabilities and testing anything they had to recently patch, walsh said.

""it's all about being prepared and not waiting for when the crisis happens,"" walsh added.",5,,Fantastic_Mr_Faux,0
