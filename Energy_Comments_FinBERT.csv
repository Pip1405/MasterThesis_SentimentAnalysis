i always thought alt l1 narratives were best when eth was working through scaling. if you think that narrative is still valid then go for it, but i got scared off when i started to figure the large vc allocations most of them have(who will sell at some point!) , and with l2s finally gaining traction, that window seemed to be closing to me. not to mention how they really don't care about being decentralized or even progress towards being more decentralized. 
  
its too early to say 100% but a successful merge and l2 maintaining their current paths, i think eth cements it's self as the dominant l1 for the next 20 to 30 years. it just has that big of a head start/proven history, network effect, evm moat.
  
edit: it also seems like there are too many l1s now, nothing to really to concentrate value into, to outperform eth. if i was trying to outperform eth it would be with $cvx and $fxs, i expect one or both of these to be in top 20 at some point in 2022 (small allocations like 1% to max like 5% of your total eth, eth is a way safer bet)",5.0,,unthinkablecryto,0.0,False,False,Positive

mj stocks are hi-beta and are quite risky, but should eventually offer great returns. what is needed is some strong fundamental news - probably coming from congress or the president, before mj stocks launch. i've been using technical indicators, but i have been getting hammered every time i get buy signals.

1643673017,"excellent analysis.  i will be honest the only reason i own $bp over shell is i couldn't decide which of the 2 different shares to own the a or b so i just went with $bp for my non usa oil position.  i realize that is a dumb reason.  although i do own $shlx so it's possible shell might buy that back like $psx is buying $psxp back and converting them into $psx shares. 

i also stayed away from $xom and $cvx because as you stated shell has a footprint in the gasoline service stations.  i went with $psx and $bp for the same reason.  i don't think it's farfetched that shell, bp, and phillips 66 can modify some of their gasoline stations into ev charging stations in the future.  the investment and infrastructure is already there. 

the carbon capture is going to be huge.  i just don't know enough about how it will work for an opinion.  

i also agree with the natural gas becoming a huge revenue driver in oil companies with natural gas and pipelines  as  crude oil is i don't want to say phased out, but maybe the increase in yoy demand lowers.  again a reason i bought phillips 66 over $xom and $cvx.  another reason why i would buy shell over them as well.

when he tried to get that judgment enforced in the us, a us court ruled that the judgment was obtained through fraud and could not be enforced. the judge who was allegedly bribed, guerra, testified in this us hearing about the bribery. the judge presiding over the hearing noted that guerra was an unreliable witness, and specifically said in his ruling that even without guerra's testimony, there was cleat evidence that donziger's ecuador judgment was fraudulent.

after that ruling, donziger appealed his case to the 2nd circuit court of appeals. they ruled against him, and again specifically noted that even though it wasn't their job to review the factual evidence against donziger, that evidence clearly indicated in their opinion that the original ecaudor judgment was fraudulent. donziger was also disbarred over this. several international courts have also recognized that the ecuador judgment was fraudulent. in addition to that, many of the counternarratives that paint donziger in a good light - for example, the idea that the us judge who ruled against him had ""direct ties to chevron"" - are pretty much bullshit. in actuality, that judge just owned some shares in a mutual fund which happened to be invested in chevron stock. donziger spends almost all of his time raising money and doing media appearances to sell his side of the story, which is why a lot of pro-donziger narratives have seaped into the public consciousness.

however, don't think i'm only on chevron's side here: they have definitely gone to great lengths to try and punish donziger, especially in the criminal contempt case that he's currently serving time for. they're definitely invested in making his life hell, and possibly colluded with the prosecutor in that case. but that doesn't mean that donziger is ""in the right"". and the biggest wrinkle in the facts of the case is that guerra later went on to claim that he was *not* bribed by donziger, and was in fact bribed by chevron to testify against donziger. overall, there are no heroes in this situation. chevron is an evil megacompany trying to do anything they can to avoid culpability for their environmental destruction, and donziger is a crooked lawyer who tried to cheat his way into a historically monumentous win in court, got burned for it, and now spends all his time trying to gaslight people into thinking he's the victim of a grand conspiracy rather than someone who flouted the legal system from the beginning.",-4.0,,Mirrormn,0.0,False,False,Positive

and i'll elaborate on why you want to do that. i have both the mc-101 and the mpc live. while the mpc is an incredible sequencer and sampler, the mc-101 destroys it in terms of diversity of stock sounds. the mc-101 has a very limited sequencer, only 4 tracks, no triplets and 16th notes together, and extremely limited sampling capabilities. with the mpc, you get the hype and tubesynth, but neither of these compare to the amazing high quality and diversity of stock presets in the mc-101. 


since i have both, i upgraded to zenology pro so that i can make custom presets and drums in the software and easily transfer them to my mc-101, but after much discovery, i found out that i can directly auto-sample the presets from zenology to the mpc. this allows me to make extremely high quality unique sounds (i've made 808s, synths, guitar sounds, etc. that the mpc stock library is missing) and transfer them to the mpc as keygroups so that i can play them with a midi keyboard. by having the roland sound library combined with the sampling and sequencing capabilities of the mpc, you have an extremely powerful (and portable if you get a battery for it) machine that gives you all the flexibility of a $3000 workstation, but without the price tag or weight.

1646145905,"houston, march 1 (reuters) - exxon mobil (xom.n) has begun removing u.s. employees working in russia, according to a person familiar with the matter. the departures include staff from its large oil and gas production operations on sakhalin island in russia's far east.  
exxon last year employed more than 1,000 people across russia with offices in moscow, st. petersburg, yekaterinburg and yuzhno-sakhalinst, according to its website.  
the company operates three large offshore oil and gas fields with operations based on sakhalin island. the number of expatriate staff being evacuated was unclear on tuesday.  
an exxon spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment.  
the company, which has been developing its russian oil and gas fields since 1995, has come under pressure to cut its ties with russia over the country's invasion of ukraine. this week, rivals bp plc, shell plc and equinor halted or disclosed plans to exit russian investments or halt operations.

1646164545,"houston, march 1 (reuters) - chevron corp (cvx.n) chief executive officer michael wirth on tuesday expressed concern over the ""tragic situation"" unfolding in ukraine, forcing oil companies to make ""very difficult decisions"" on continued operations in russia.  


  
wirth touched on the growing awareness of the need for additional oil and gas supplies, worries over cyberattacks against the oil industry and rapidly rising fuel prices in remarks to wall street analysts and reporters.  


  
the company's annual investor outlook came as oil markets were rattled by russia's attacks on ukraine andrivals bp plc , shell plc and equinor (eqnr.ol) halting or abandoningrussian business ventures and investments.  


&amp;#x200b;

  
chevron is one of the ""least exposed"" among the oil majors to russia risk, according to allen good, an analyst with morningstar equity research firm.  


  
a globally coordinated release of oil reserves could help ease supply concerns and cool crude price hikes, wirth said.  


  
major oil-consuming nations on tuesday agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves as oil futures jumped more than 9% to trade near $107 per barrel. read more  


&amp;#x200b;

  
long-term energy security  


  
the united states is revisiting its stance on new domestic oil production, the chevron ceo signaled, referring to recent talks with the u.s. government that had focused on climate concerns and limiting carbon emissions.  


  
""we have a lot of common ground,"" wirth said, declining to discuss specific conversations. ""in the early months, i wish there had been more dialogue.""  


&amp;#x200b;

  
achieving long-term energy security for the united states would include an ""attitude to support investment"" in oil production growth, wirth said.  


  
""nobody knows how long the situation will endure,"" he said.  


  
chevron on tuesday reiterated plans to raise output in the u.s. permian shale basin by 10% in 2022 and expand production there to more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the coming years, from 681,000 bpd in the fourth quarter.  


  
its permian production could grow to between 1.2-1.5 million bpd, the company said at a corporate presentation, without specifying a timeframe to achieve it.  


  
while the company has ""a lot of running room in the permian,"" a decision to further expand production will be based on profitability, wirth said.  


&amp;#x200b;

  
cybersecurity costs  
the oil major has been increasing spending on cybersecurity as the industry faces increased threats of hacker attacks to operations.  


  
""we are in a high-risk environment right now from a cyber standpoint,"" wirth said. ""we are an industry that is a high-profiled, high-value target for bad actors.""  


  
wirth said chevron is less exposed to sanctions on russia than many of its rivals.  


  
""a number of other companies had to take very difficult decisions. we have very little exposure to russia as a company, but these are very difficult decisions to be made,"" he told cnbc.  


  
he stressed the importance for world oil supply of the caspian pipeline consortium (cpc), operator of a oil line that moves crude from russia and kazakhstan and in which chevron holds a 15% interest.  


  
chevron is relying on added production from kazakhstan and the permian basin to raise its output by more than 3% per year through 2026.  


&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

  
the pipeline exported 1.1 million bpd of crude from kazakhstan and 200,000 bpd from russia in 2021.  
""it is an important source supply"" the world ""really needs"" right now,"" wirth said.  


  
but buyers have been avoiding its oil in recent days due to sanctions over russia, reuters reported. read more  


  
chevron also has a 50% stake in tengizchevroil (tco), which is developing the tengiz and korolev crude oil fields in western kazakhstan.  


  
""we have had no indications from any government that operations of the caspian pipeline consortium are likely to be interrupted,"" wirth said. ""beyond the caspian pipeline, we really have no other exposure to russia and none to ukraine.""",3.0,,egeym,0.0,True,False,Positive

of the 8 the profitable trades. 4 trades were closed early ($rrc cds, $rcl pds, $ual pds, $trip pds) that could have been closed for maximum profit. the remaining 4 trades were closed extremely close to maximum profit to generate funds for additional trades. 

of the 8 failed trades, 2 trades ($ip pds, and $cvx cds made halfway through today) were genuine analysis mistakes on my part and were incorrect reads on the market. i'm particularly disappointed in myself for making the $cvx cds as i sold my $cvx pds i got this morning for profit and got a little trigger happy and tried predicting a reversal. i'm embarassed about this one. the $ip pds seemed like a correct read on the market so i don't fully understand why this one failed but i exited early and it seems like there was no chance of profit or breakeven after i exited. i'll be analyzing this one closely. for now i need to address my primary instincts of closing early. albeit these unstable market conditions are making it difficult.",3.0,,[deleted],0.0,False,False,Positive

1646959450,"i've put up a cross post on some other subs, i'll add it here as a comment just in case you're interested in the bigger picture:

hi there,

##**tldr**; inherited $450k of chevron stock which is currently experiencing extreme volatility and wondering if it's a good idea to take the jump into a long term active management relationship or if i should just bogle my money into a passive 3 fund etf portfolio that i manage myself for little to no cost, but any overall input on my situation is welcome as this is a big step for me.

i'm a 37 year old theater actor (theater industry still reeling from covid). i earn about 30k a year between my side hustle, which is wine tours (i live in napa, ca), and theater jobs, and 16k/yr from dividends from the inherited account.

i'm currently looking at moving to the la area to begin expanding into film work and better access to regional theater auditions, which would be a massive increase in expenses for me. my dividend income has really allowed me to stay afloat while i build my skills and resume in theater. my short-to-medium term picture is very unclear because i'm also tossing around the idea of relocating overseas, extended travel, going back to school for a different career, etc.

the big problem is, my account is 100% cvx shares (currently at all time highs and incredibly volatile due to recent events). my current broker does not actively manage my account since it's just 1 single holding and i declined their offer in years past to manage the account and help diversify for 1%aum. they are a medium sized firm and i would likely be one of their smallest clients, though we have family history.

they gave me a pitch to manage my assets and assist me in divesting from cvx:


*   i.      total stock market index (equity) ‚Äì 18%

*   ii.      esg fund (equity) ‚Äì 10%
 
*   iii.      international fund (equity) ‚Äì 10%
 
*   iv.      dividend fund (equity) ‚Äì 5%
 
*   v.      value fund (equity) ‚Äì 5%
 
*    vi.      low duration bond fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 20%

*    vii.      income fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 20%

*   viii.      short term bond fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 10%

*    ix.      cash ‚Äì 2%

this based on the discussion that i may need income to support my relocation and i might be looking at trying to finance a house/condo in the next 3-5 years. my short term plans are very much up in the air due to pandemic, relocation, possibly returning to school to look at a career change, etc. i don't have a job offer in la, nor do i have eyes on a place yet, but i have a lot of entertainment industry contacts and a background in the wine industry which i feel confident will help me at least find decent work quickly enough. i have about 60k saved in cash to give me a bit of a runway and i have another 10k available as margin (at 2% rate currently). no debt and very low expenses (for now).

i currently have a roth ira and a taxable brokerage acct with m1 finance worth about 75k, about 50k of that is in equities and about 25k in cash earning 1% interest. i have another 30k in a savings account in cash. i'm looking at about a -$45k tax bill based on my cost basis for the shares if i liquidate that account and about $4k/yr for management with either option. my friend is also available on an hourly rate fee basis, but he feels it would be best to bring my account into his book given the complexity of my goals and current situation rather than just directing me to do it myself for $2k a year in consultation fees. of course, there's some bias to that recommendation, but it may still be good advice.

overall, i feel confident that both of these advisors are very trustworthy. both are about my same age, and both are interested in ethical financial practices like i am (my friend has a much more ethics-based component to his practices but will always defer to client preferences). i'm just not sure if i should save that extra $4k/yr and just draw out money as i need supplementary income myself, or if it would be a good idea in my position to have a go-to cfp to help direct my finances for me.

1646959542,"hi there,

##**tldr**; inherited $450k of chevron stock which is currently experiencing extreme volatility and wondering if it's a good idea to take the jump into a long term active management relationship or if i should just bogle my money into a passive 3 fund etf portfolio that i manage myself for little to no cost, but any overall input on my situation is welcome as this is a big step for me.

i'm a 37 year old theater actor (theater industry still reeling from covid). i earn about 30k a year between my side hustle, which is wine tours (i live in napa, ca), and theater jobs, and 16k/yr from dividends from the inherited account.

i'm currently looking at moving to the la area to begin expanding into film work and better access to regional theater auditions, which would be a massive increase in expenses for me. my dividend income has really allowed me to stay afloat while i build my skills and resume in theater. my short-to-medium term picture is very unclear because i'm also tossing around the idea of relocating overseas, extended travel, going back to school for a different career, etc.

the big problem is, my account is 100% cvx shares (currently at all time highs and incredibly volatile due to recent events). my current broker does not actively manage my account since it's just 1 single holding and i declined their offer in years past to manage the account and help diversify for 1%aum. they are a medium sized firm and i would likely be one of their smallest clients, though we have family history.

they gave me a pitch to manage my assets and assist me in divesting from cvx:


*   i.      total stock market index (equity) ‚Äì 18%

*   ii.      esg fund (equity) ‚Äì 10%
 
*   iii.      international fund (equity) ‚Äì 10%
 
*   iv.      dividend fund (equity) ‚Äì 5%
 
*   v.      value fund (equity) ‚Äì 5%
 
*    vi.      low duration bond fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 20%

*    vii.      income fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 20%

*   viii.      short term bond fund (fixed income) ‚Äì 10%

*    ix.      cash ‚Äì 2%

this based on the discussion that i may need income to support my relocation and i might be looking at trying to finance a house/condo in the next 3-5 years. my short term plans are very much up in the air due to pandemic, relocation, possibly returning to school to look at a career change, etc. i don't have a job offer in la, nor do i have eyes on a place yet, but i have a lot of entertainment industry contacts and a background in the wine industry which i feel confident will help me at least find decent work quickly enough. i have about 60k saved in cash to give me a bit of a runway and i have another 10k available as margin (at 2% rate currently). no debt and very low expenses (for now).

i have a friend who is also a cfp who looked at their ideas for me and basically agreed that they aren't doing anything revolutionary or untoward and would likely serve me just fine, and he also offered to manage my money himself (he is with a much smaller firm and i would be one of his biggest clients, and might be able to devote a lot more time to my account). my friends ethics also align much more closely to mine which is important to me.

my suggestions:
1. sell the cvx stock or at least enough of it to get it down to below 5% of your portfolio. where is the $45k tax bill coming from? it seems unrealistically high. inherited stock, when held in a taxable account, gets a step up in basis upon the death of the deceased and any gain would be considered long term, so a capital gains rate of 15% is the most likely rate. you would have to have a gain of $300k to force a ltcg tax of $45k

2. based upon you current circumstances, with several life changes being considered, i‚Äôd be cautious about scaling your stock picking based upon your wealth. adopt a three fund portfolio after setting aside any money you may need for your short term needs (3-5 years or less). if your plans change, you can deploy any excess cash later.",2.0,,BoglesFollies,0.0,False,False,Positive

30% us stocks, 40% long-term treasuries, 15% intermediate-term treasuries, 7.5% commodities, diversified and 7.5% gold.  
  
this could be broadly covered by etfs 30% $vti, 40% $vglt, 15% $vgit, 7.5% $iau and 7.5% $pdbc.  
  
however, i'd guess that inflation will rise and growth will fall over the next five years... that creates a couple of problems, because stocks are going to be less  interesting and those vglt and vgit products should dip in value because of rising interest rates gradually making the bonds they hold irrelevant. so, perhaps foolishly i'd ignore these bond products and go for stocks in sectors that have a high level of outperformance vs. inflation and a high probability of beating inflation. that is basically energy, equity reits, consumer staples and perhaps utilities and healthcare at a push.

1647088015,"first off, this is a very good problem to have!

i‚Äôm studying to be a cfp right now, and i‚Äôm highly critical of the aum model. advisors tend to overcomplicate things, because if they just make what i see as a prudent choice and drop most of their clients‚Äô money into, say, a target-date retirement fund, you would quickly realize their 1% fee is patently absurd‚Äìyou could manage this shit yourself and almost certainly get better returns through passive index funds!

i‚Äôm not sure what the most prudent decision is regarding selling your chevron stock‚Äîmy instinct would be to sell it all, since if you‚Äôre filing single, your taxable income is presumably below the ~$445,000 cap, past which the ltcg rate becomes 20%. if you were to try for the 0% rate, you‚Äôd only be selling a fraction of the stock in any given year, and it would take more than a decade to dispose of it. (all the while, chevron‚Äôs value could plummet‚Äîyou never know!)

there might be some weird tax implications if your income suddenly skyrockets for a year (welfare cliffs and the like if you‚Äôre on government-sponsored anything), so if that sort of thing keeps you up at night, you might consider hiring your friend (at the hourly rate only) to clarify the tax situation in regards to selling your stock. (then again, you could probably do this research yourself, as i doubt the answer‚Äôs very complicated.)

i know myself well enough to say that i would be kicking myself if i held all my assets in one company and something bad happened to it. by being strongly invested in one company, you expose yourself to tremendous amounts of non-systematic risk since you‚Äôre only one oil spill or corporate scandal away from losing vast amounts of unrealized wealth. if your time horizon is plenty long, you can take your profits now and invest it all in something simple and cheap, whether that be a target-date retirement fund, or a total stock market index fund, or a total international stock market index fund, or a total bond market index fund‚Ä¶ sky‚Äôs the limit! just keep it simple (no more than three funds) and keep the fees cheap! the alternative is to let your advisor siphon off nearly $5000 a year from you just to create a complicated portfolio with 8 separate funds that closely mimics a conservative target-date retirement fund, one you could get yourself for less than 0.10% per year (only $450!)

i might not have all of the intricacies down yet (i‚Äôve only completed one semester), but one of the ironies in the industry is that it‚Äôs not vast amounts of knowledge that generate wealth‚Äîit‚Äôs practicing a few simple behaviors. keep your fees low when you can, keep your investments simple enough that *you* can understand and manage them, and if you still have questions and feel like hiring an advisor, stick with an hourly rate‚Äîcome to them with a specific problem and pay them $500 to deal with it. don‚Äôt sign up for an aum plan that costs 10 times as much year after year and only further complicates your life.",1.0,,have_two_cows,0.0,False,False,Positive

oslo, april 25 (reuters) - norwegian police said they had arrested 20 greenpeace and extinction rebellion campaigners who on monday blocked a tanker from delivering russian oil to an exxon mobil terminal.

in a protest against russia's invasion of ukraine, activists had fastened their red rubber dinghy to the ust luga's anchor chain, greenpeace said, as they sought to prevent it offloading an estimated 95,000 tonnes of oil.

""oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis, but also of wars and conflicts. i am shocked that norway operates as a free port for russian oil, which we know finances putin's warfare,"" greenpeace norway head frode pleym said.

the group called on the norwegian government to ban imports of russian fossil fuels and said that exxon mobil's (xom.n) norwegian esso unit should cancel any contracts for such imports from russia over its invasion of ukraine, which moscow describes as a ""special military operation"".

norwegian police later said all the activists had been removed from the area.

the hong kong registered ust luga is anchored outside esso's slagen oil terminal about 70 km (43 miles) south of the capital oslo, according to vessel tracker marine traffic.

esso norway had agreed to buy the oil before the conflict started and does not have plans for further purchases from russia, a company spokesperson told reuters.

""esso norway fully complies with all norwegian sanctions and we support the coordinated international efforts to end russia's unprovoked attack,"" esso said in an emailed statement.

1651106322,"looks like you probably bought erx and gush because oil was high? yeah, the trick is that you need to buy them *before* they go up in price, not after. it's awesome if you already hold oil/energy stocks, but it's probably a pretty bad time to buy them right now.

if it makes you feel better, even warren buffet has made that exact mistake with oil in 2008:

&gt;""last year i made a major mistake of commission (and maybe more; this one sticks out). without urging from charlie \[munger\] or anyone else, i bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. i in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. i still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40-$50 price. but so far i have been dead wrong. even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars.""

darei um exemplo:

se voc√™ decidisse converter euros em d√≥lares no in√≠cio de janeiro (eur/usd 1,14) para comprar a√ß√µes da exxon ($xom) e, agora queria vender quais seriam os seus retornos em usd e em eur?

eis a matem√°tica para 10.000‚Ç¨:

1- convers√£o eur em usd -&gt; 10.000‚Ç¨ seriam 11.400$ (eur/usd 1,14).

2- comprar a√ß√µes da xom a 64$ (\~178 a√ß√µes)

3- retorno de 34,17% ytd, em que as a√ß√µes da xom valem 85,25$. (178\*85,25 = 15.174,50$)

4- convers√£o usd em eur -&gt; 15.174,50$ s√£o convertidos em 14.451‚Ç¨ (eur/usd 1,05)-

5- investimento inicial: 10.000‚Ç¨ valor atual: 14.451‚Ç¨ retorno absoluto: 4.451‚Ç¨ retorno relativo: 44,52%

posi√ß√£o euro - retorno 44,52%; posi√ß√£o d√≥lar - retorno 34,17%

assim, as taxas de convers√£o apenas beneficiam aqueles que efetuaram investimentos em d√≥lares e que posteriormente os v√£o converter em euros. minimizam as perdas e maximizam os ganhos.

1651889157,"new delhi, april 28 (reuters) - india has asked state-run energy companies to evaluate the possibility of buying european oil major bp's (bp.l) stake in sanctions-hit russian firm rosneft, two people familiar with the matter said.

bp has announced it is abandoning its 19.75% stake in rosneft. read more

the oil ministry last week conveyed its intent to ongc videsh ltd (ovl), indian oil corp. (ioc.ns), bharat petro resources ltd (bprl), hindustan pertoleum's (hpcl.ns) subsidiary prize petroleum ltd, oil india ltd (oili.ns) and gail (india) ltd (gail.ns), the sources said.

indian companies and the oil ministry did not respond to reuters emails seeking comment.

while western nations have imposed sanctions against russia over the war in ukraine, india has not explicitly condemned moscow's actions there.

the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, india imports about 85% of its 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil needs.

the call on indian companies to explore buying the stake in rosneft came after bp ceo bernard looney met indian oil minister hardeep singh puri in march.

bp declined to comment.

oil ministry also asked ovl, the overseas investment arm of oil and natural gas corp (ongc.ns), to consider buying a 30% stake held by exxon mobile corp (xom.n), in the sakhalin 1 project in russia's far east. exxon is the operator of the project.

ovl already holds a 20% stake in the project.

exxon said on march 1 it would exit about $4 billion in assets and discontinue all its russia operations, including sakhalin 1.

ovl also holds 26% stake in vankorneft, owner of the venkor field in the west siberian basin.

separately, a consortium of oil india, ioc, and bprl, the exploration arm of state refiner bharat petroleum corp (bpcl.ns), holds a 23.9% stake in vankorneft and a 29.9% stake in taas-yuryakh in east siberia.

one of the sources said indian companies hope to get stakes in russian assets at discounted rates given the risk involved, dubbing the potential transactions ""distress sales"".

a second source said indian companies needed to study the impact of sanctions on potential investments and yet to start a process of due diligence.

""the fear is that this investment could get stuck in russia as sanctions might bar us from bringing equity oil and gas to india.""

""our effort has been to see how we can stabilise economic transactions, economic engagements with russia in the current context ... there are of course constraints, there are sanctions by some countries, and we will have to kind of work through that,"" india's foreign ministry spokesperson arindam bagchi told a news conference.

it would have been better to think of the marcos voters as a force of nature rather than the ""general public"" that you must sway towards the light. they simply will not see it that way, because they don't want to think about their vote. they know what the people around them tell them and that's fucking it. i know because i am friends with some of them. and thus, like any force of nature, you can either use it or let it kill you.

the same attitude that lets you shrug off accountability right now is the same attitude that fueled the ""fighting"" that transpired to win leni the presidency. it's the classic liberal thought paradigm of ""i am right, i have the moral high ground, therefore i *have* to win"".  this manifested itself in a legion of fucktards in pink trying to convince an even bigger and even stupider legion of fucktards in red using graphs, facts, numbers, percentages, exxon mobil stock price. which the bbm crowd responded to precisely zero percent of.

you people don't want to hear it, but blame is shared here. the only thing this election has showed me is that the two sides at odds are merely two sides of the same dumbass coin. they're both composed of emotional whelps whose sole stratagem is to rush headlong into violent sociopolitical discourse that ultimately leads nowhere. devoid of any semblance of foresight, introspection, or cunning.

1652806473,"london/basra, may 17 (reuters) - iraq's oil ministry thwarted three prospective deals last year that would have handed chinese firms more control over its oilfields and led to an exodus of international oil majors that baghdad wants to invest in its creaking economy.

since the start of 2021, plans by russia's lukoil (lkoh.mm) and u.s. oil major exxon mobil (xom.n) to sell stakes in major fields to chinese state-backed firms have hit the buffers after interventions from iraq's oil ministry, according to iraqi oil officials and industry executives.

selling a stake to a state-run chinese company was also one of several options being considered by britain's bp (bp.l), but officials persuaded it to stay in iraq for now, people familiar with the matter said.

china is iraq's top investor and baghdad was the biggest beneficiary last year of beijing's belt and road initiative, receiving $10.5 billion in financing for infrastructure projects including a power plant and an airport.

but when it comes to further chinese investment in major oilfields, baghdad has drawn a line in the sand.

iraq's government and officials at state-run firms are concerned that further consolidation of fields in the hands of chinese companies could accelerate an exodus of western oil companies, a total of seven iraqi oil officials and executives with companies operating in iraq told reuters in interviews.

supported by state-run oil company officials, iraq's oil minister ihsan abdul jabbar dissuaded lukoil last year from selling a stake in one of the country's largest fields, west qurna 2, to chinese state firm sinopec , three people familiar with the matter said.

iraqi officials also intervened last year to stop chinese state-backed firms buying exxon's stake in west qurna 1 and to persuade bp (bp.l) to stay in iraq rather than offloading its interest in the giant rumaila oilfield to a chinese company, people familiar with the matter said.

combined, rumaila and west qurna produce about half of the crude coming out of iraq, which sits on the fifth-largest oil reserves in the world.

iraq's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the deals or the minister's role in any interventions.

the government worried that china's dominance could make iraq less attractive for investment from elsewhere, two government officials said.

china's strengthening relationship with iran has helped its position in iraq due to tehran's political and military influence there, but the oil ministry is wary of ceding more control over the country's key resources, some officials said.

""we don't want the iraqi energy sector to be labelled as a china-led energy sector and this attitude is agreed by government and the oil ministry,"" another iraqi official said.

risky strategy
the interventions over bp, exxon and lukoil's positions in iraq come after british oil major shell (shel.l) decided in 2018 to withdraw from iraq's vast majnoon oilfield.

the interventions also mark a shift in stance after chinese companies won most energy deals and contracts awarded over the past four years. iraqi oil officials said chinese firms have accepted lower profit margins than most rivals.

""all the rules regarding tenders were formulated jointly by the chinese and iraqi sides and were conducted under transparent and fair principles,"" said state-owned china national offshore oil corporation (cnooc) (0883.hk) in an emailed statement.

pushing back against further chinese investment is a risky strategy, though, as there's no guarantee others will step up and the government needs billions of dollars to rebuild the economy after the islamic state insurgency was defeated in 2017.

over the past decade, oil revenue accounted for 99% of iraq's exports, 85% of the country's budget and 42% of its gross domestic product, according to the world bank.

while oil majors jostled to get access to iraq's vast oilfields after the u.s.-led invasion in 2003, they are increasingly focused on the energy transition and more profitable plays elsewhere. they also want better terms to develop fields, oil executives said.

china is among the biggest buyers of iraq's crude and chinese state firms have built up a dominant position in its oil industry.

but when lukoil notified the government last summer that it was considering selling some of its stake in west qurna 2 to sinopec, the oil minister intervened, people familiar with the matter said.

it has not previously been reported that sinopec was the potential buyer of lukoil's stake. the chinese company did not respond to a request for comment.

to encourage lukoil to stay, iraq offered a sweetener, a person with direct knowledge said.

a few months after lukoil signalled it was considering a sale, baghdad finally approved its plan to develop a field known as block 10, where the russian company had discovered an oil reservoir in 2017. afterwards, lukoil dropped the idea of selling its stake in west qurna 2, the source said.

lukoil did not respond to a request for comment.

bp and exxon
over the past few years bp has also spoken to the government about its options - including leaving iraq altogether - before settling on spinning off its stake in rumaila into a standalone company last year, two people familiar with the matter said.

oil minister abdul jabbar led efforts to convince bp not to leave as the government was concerned its partner in the field, china national petroleum corporation (cnpc), would buy bp's stake, the people said. baghdad was also keen to keep such a high-profile international oil major in the country, they said.

bp declined to comment.

when exxon flagged its intention to leave iraq in january 2021, meanwhile, u.s. officials told exxon they were unhappy with the prospect of the biggest u.s. oil major pulling out ‚Äì for reasons that echoed iraqi concerns.

state department officials said exxon's departure could create a vacuum for chinese companies to fill, a person familiar with the conversations said.

u.s. officials then asked exxon what it would take to stay in iraq, the person said, declining to give further details.

a state department spokesperson said: ""we regularly engage with our iraqi counterparts on fostering an environment conducive to private sector investment.""

exxon had signed an agreement for the sale of its interest in west qurna 1 to cnooc and petrochina (601857.ss), the listed arm of cnpc, people familiar with the matter said.

neither cnooc nor cnpc responded to requests for comment about the deals.

exxon's stake was valued at $350 million to $375 million, said people familiar with the matter.

iraq has veto power over oilfield deals, however, and did not approve the transaction.

exxon filed for arbitration with the international chamber of commerce against basra oil co., arguing that it had followed the terms of its contract for west qurna 1 and had a good deal on the table, people familiar with the matter said.

the oil ministry then took the unusual step of trying to broker a deal on exxon's behalf. the ministry offered exxon's stake to other western companies including chevron corp (cvx.n).

no one was interested. rather than let the stake go to the chinese companies, baghdad said the state-run iraq national oil company (inoc) would take it instead, though inoc is still in the process of being revived after being defunct for many years.

""(exxon) will continue to work closely and constructively to reach an equitable resolution,"" said a spokeswoman.

service contracts
iraq's oil industry is mostly based on technical service contracts between the state-backed basra oil co. and foreign companies that are repaid costs plus a fee per barrel to develop fields, while iraq retains ownership of the reserves.

oil majors typically prefer deals that allow a share in profits rather than a set fee.

the priority for chinese firms, however, is achieving secure oil supplies to feed china's growing economy, rather than returns for investors, said a chinese oil executive with direct knowledge of cnpc's global investments.

there are some signs, however, that iraq is attempting to make its terms more appealing.

france's totalenergies (ttef.pa) signed a $27 billion deal in september that included payment of 40% of revenue from one field. the deal has stalled, however, due to disputes over terms and it still needs approval from some iraqi government agencies, reuters reported in february. read more

totalenergies said it was fully committed to the project.

one oil company executive said they were sceptical iraq would introduce more attractive terms. but unless they improve significantly, analysts say it is hard to imagine iraq will be able to stem the exodus as the energy transition accelerates.

""many of the energy majors are looking at the carbon emissions, their ability to generate cash flows if commodity prices are low, and they're looking at improving returns,"" said ian thom, research director at consultancy wood mackenzie.

""as the priorities of the energy companies are changing, the relative attractiveness of iraq is changing.""

today, after oil has been over 100 for months, i don't see it. you can go down the list the last seven or eight months: $oxy +150%, $mro +130%, xom +60%, cvx +60%. they're all priced expecting oil to go much higher than it is today.

&gt; houston/washington, june 5 - italian oil company eni spa and spain&amp;#039;s repsol sa could begin shipping venezuelan oil to europe as soon as next month to make up for russian crude, five people familiar with the matter said, resuming oil-for-debt swaps halted two years ago when washington stepped up sanctions on venezuela.

&gt; others excludedwashington has not made similar allowances for u.s. oil major chevron corp(cvx.n), india&amp;#039;s oil and natural gas corp ltd and france&amp;#039;s maurel &amp; prom sa(maup.pa), which also lobbied the u.s. state department and u.s. treasury department to take oil in return for billions of dollars in accumulated debts from venezuela.

&gt; all five oil companies halted swapping oil for debt in mid-2020 in the midst of former u.s. president donald trump&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;maximum pressure&amp;quot; campaign that cut venezuela&amp;#039;s oil exports but failed to oust maduro.

energy is really hot right now and industry is picking up.  oil and gas is also on fire.  tech and healthcare are still holding on by the skin of their teeth, so these might be okay dip buys.  on the flip side, retail trade, financials, and consumer durables are getting slaughtered right now after the sector rotation.

if you're going to buy and hold and grow, you want to buy and hold the strongest stocks until they are no longer strong.  use a long lens, 6months+ to form your opinion.  there's nothing wrong with f generally, and it pays a dividend which is nice, but you can probably find stocks that are going to outcompete it in the short-medium term without the frustration of only making $50-$60 on your money every week.  for example, a 1sd $xom put is going to gain you ~$85 per week , 41% more return on your # of shares vs. $f and its sector and it are much stronger than the market right now, and will likely continue the longer the ukraine war drags on and russian gas exports are crippled by the sanctions only leading to more demand and higher prices.",1.0,,MADEUPDINOSAURFACTS,0.0,False,False,Positive

if you want higher dividends then in the sectors look at the following. 

tech - $avgo or $csco. higher dividend stocks with growth. not growth like apple or msft but still growth. 

health - $abbv or $$pfe. amazing returns the last few years and much higher dividends than jnj

telecom - there is really no great ones but $lumn is 8% and $t is 5%. i would actually rotate from telcom into an energy stock like $dvn or $xom right now. 

industrials - 3m is a steady dividend payer but a company like $dow or $ups has given growth with a competitive dividend. 3m has not offered much in terms of growth the last five years. 

cs - $ko is nice and steady but probably one of the best in this sector is $mo. high dividend and good growth, if you can handle owning a tobacco company this is a better ply than $ko for now and you can rotate to $ko if it takes a down turn. 

etf - $schd is the go to and $jepi is a high dividend payer. 

others to consider for income are bdcs like $gain, $glad, $pflt, $psec or the reits like $o or $good. all six of those are monthly dividends that pay at higher yields if you want income. 

but at 21 if you are looking for long term growth with a steady drip and minimal downside, that will turn into a nice supplemental income when you are older i like what you have except for 3m. i really want to add 3m to my portfolio but there is a lot of better companies right now in that sector with better dividends and growth.",18.0,,[deleted],0.0,False,False,Positive

there's still the missing question of *why*. which you refuse to acknowledge or answer, or it's just ""big oil"" i guess. 

&gt;u.s. shale producers' decision this year to resist pumping more oil even as prices surge could be nearing an end, according to company executives.

&gt;several major oil companies, including bp plc (bp.l), chevron corp (cvx.n) and exxon mobil corp (xom.n), are planning to increase output or shale spending next year, undercutting opec's tight supply management that has pushed crude oil prices above $80 a barrel as global demand for fuel rebounded more swiftly than many anticipated.

&gt;the planning uptick in shale will come from larger companies and particularly from the permian basin, the top u.s. shale field. the change follows pressure from the white house for more production as retail fuel prices rise.

&gt;permian output is forecast to hit 4.89 million bpd in november, just below the peak 4.91 million bpd of march 2020 before the pandemic hit. the remaining shale regions, however, have lagged, producing a quarter less oil than at their peak in early 2020.

even biden admitted we need oil supply in *november*. 

&gt;why would they open up new drilling just to drive their own price down? why wouldn't they instead buy back their own stock to enrich themselves? 

cuz they're businesses...where they can enrich themselves *more* by selling more product. 

&gt;that's somehow biden's fault?

yes. via his energy policy. he shut down keystone xl, day one. he won't hold auctions for leases on land, let alone permits.

""we would transition from the oil industry.""

&gt;bash: ""thank you, mr. vice president. just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a biden administration?""

&gt;biden: ""no, we would -- we would work it out. we would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either -- any fossil fuel.""

do you understand this yet?

&gt;they would have done that under any administration. they just would have given you a different narrative.

being that we have no time machine or alternate universe, we have what we have. might be a different narrative, likely would also be lower gas prices lmfao

&gt;putting it in your car might be far away now, but you never know.

oh what a relief, in 20-30 years, i can fill my car up with thorium salts...how does that help me fuel my car, in 2022? 

&gt;i don't see why you want to be stuck to the oil companies though. there is a future. the oil companies know it. i don't see what's so great at being held hostage to their whim.

the ""being stuck"" comes with understanding our current reality. how are we ""being held hostage""? we literally need gasoline and diesel lmfao. there's a very easy solution here...it doesn't involve price caps. do you just want difficult solutions, that wouldn't even necessarily work? 

&gt;they printed money a bunch of times and inflation didn't happen. why now? economists are trying to answer that. some are talking about market consolidation.

do you just not acknowledge that the last 2 years of shuttering economies, stopping factories in their tracks in china, has consequences? too much money (stimulus, otherwise) chasing too few goods (no chinese factories churning out products, no tourism, no leisure travel for more than a year). 

&gt;i don't understand why you have to see drilling for oil as the only solution. it's not. the oil companies know it. you're still buying their narrative. all they want is more money.

we lack crude oil supply. the solutions: buy it from elsewhere or get it ourselves. if they wanted more money, why wouldn't they drill more, and supply more oil? 

&gt;""as oil prices rise, it's increasingly likely that oil production growth resumes,"" said josh young, chief investment officer of energy investor bison interests. the gains, however, will remain below the rate of pre-covid-19 increases, he said.

&gt;overall u.s. crude production rose last week to *11.5 million barrels per day*, according to latest u.s. energy department figures, inching closer to its peak of about *13 million bpd* before the coronavirus pandemic hit last year. 

from november: 12% shortfall. 

&gt;do you know that peak oil already happened over a decade ago? the price of new drilling and the price set by demand have been competing with each other.

1654984454,"‚Äúlos angeles, june 10 (reuters) - u.s. president joe biden on friday accused the u.s. oil industry, and exxon mobil corp (xom.n) in particular, of capitalizing on a supply shortage to fatten profits after a report showed inflation surging to a new 40-year record.

share buybacks improve earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, indirectly helping to boost share prices. companies see buybacks as a way to reward investors.

the u.s. state department sent letters to eni and spain's repsol (rep.mc) in may authorizing them to resume taking venezuelan crude as a way to settle billions of dollars of unpaid debt and dividends owed by the opec-member nation.

a second tanker chartered by eni, the very large crude carrier (vlcc) pantanassa, is currently navigating towards venezuela and expected to load 2 million barrels of the same grade, diluted crude oil (dco), and take it to europe, according to the eikon data and a shipping document seen by reuters.

that cargo is expected to be delivered by venezuela's state-owned pdvsa later this month with an option for eni to sell a portion of the crude to spain's repsol (rep.mc)for its cartagena and bilbao refineries, according to the document and sources.

the malta-flagged pantanassa is scheduled to load via ship-to-ship transfer near venezuela's amuay port, the document added.

eni, repsol and pdvsa did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

venezuela's may oil exports plummeted to the lowest level in 19 months over contract changes enforced by pdvsa to switch most spot sales to prepayment, reducing the risk of unpaid cargoes. the change did not affect customers under swap deals of debt payment agreements.

european, asian and u.s. companies operating joint ventures with pdvsa in venezuela, including eni, repsol, chevron (cvx.n), ongc ltd (ongc.ns), and maurel &amp; prom (maup.pa), have accumulated billions of dollars in pending debt since the government of then u.s. president donald trump suspended oil swaps used for exchanging venezuelan oil for fuel and debt payments.",11.0,,Massimo24ore,0.0,False,False,Positive

the thing is, even if, say, oil and gas was banned in the usa tomorrow, you‚Äôd still have cars on the road for 30 years more. easily. they also make a number of other chemical products, outside of oil and gas.

1657153779,"&gt; when much of that corporation‚Äôs profit (more than what trickles down to the average citizen) is put to use lobbying the government for pro-fossil fuel positions.

this might sound a bit crazy, but if you look into it, they don't really spend that much money. exxon mobil has spent $859,000 over the past year giving to both democrats and republicans. they spent about $6.8 million total including the the lawyers/lobbying firms. that's on about $5.5 billion in net income, just in the last 3 months. the whole oil and gas industry combined in their biggest spending year (2020 leading up to the election) spent $140 million. that means if americans spent 50 cents each, they could outspend the entire industry.

https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=e01

&gt; i find it highly doubtful that exxon mobil would intentionally invest in long-term alternative energy solutions over short term profits.

i don't think they really care how they make their money. it's like a chef in a restaurant. if you order pizza, they'll make you a pizza. if you order pasta, they'll make you pasta. they just want you to give them money. 

[i think the real reason why alternative energy has gained popularity is because technological advances have made them cheaper than oil.](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/808016558/as-solar-energys-price-has-dropped-more-companies-get-onboard) but there's still no good battery tech to store energy overnight so there is still value in fossil fuels, especially oil. but if exxon can get the same amount of revenue for less cost, they'll be thrilled.

&gt; evs are beginning to catch on but only because of tremendous public pressure around the world. 

this is the value of taxes and subsidies. if governments make it cheaper to produce new alternative energy technology and more expensive to produce fossil fuels, then the chef will start making more pizza than pasta.

&gt; it‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúwe want cheaper gas as consumers‚Äù when that‚Äôs the only option for the lay person. 

i want cheaper gas as a consumer, but i vote to implement higher gas taxes and fossil fuel regulations. i appreciate the small amount of money i get from owning exxon mobil stock, but also the small amount i get from owning tesla (and the other 10,000 companies in a total world index fund). i like that fossil fuels sales provide tax revenue to the government, but dislike that it destroys part of the atmosphere that i own 1/7 billionths of. everything we do has good and bad actions for ourselves and everyone else. we have to balance the party and the hangover.

&gt; the weight of this statement is diminished by how concentrated in the hands of the few that 0.8% is.

sure, but we choose who those people are. we vote for a president who has the power to nuke everyone on earth with the push of a button. that's a lot of power concentrated in a single person. similarly, we vote with our dollars when it comes to investing. elon musk is a billionaire because investors are willing to spend about $700 for a share of tesla stock, even though it's an unprofitable company. there's about a billion shares of tesla in the world so the total value of the company is about $700 billion. elon musk owns about 20% off the company, which means he owns about $140 billion worth of tesla stock. investors are giving up their hard earned money today for elon's promise of more money tomorrow.

meanwhile, if i made that same promise, i'm guessing people wouldn't be willing to give me their cash. similarly, if i offered to hold onto the nuclear football, people wouldn't vote to entrust me with it. investors choose who they want to entrust with their money/financial power and exactly how much they want to give (e.g., what percentage of their life savings they want to give to musk). voters chose who they want to entrust with their political power, but they can't choose how much they give (that is determined by the total number of voters in a given district.) 

i use a hat example, but another way to think about is like magical powers. as a consumer, you have the power to buy a product (increase demand) or boycott a product (decrease demand). as a worker, you can increase or decrease supply. as an investor you can choose who you want to give power (including yourself), but the minute you decide you no longer trust elon musk, you can sell your tesla shares. tesla's value is down 42% since january 1, and so is elon musk's net worth and overall power. as a voter, your power is relatively weak. you can only replace presidents once every four years, and there are fewer options to choose from (a few candidates vs. thousands of companies and potential ceos). if you vote to give some ceo the power to lobby the government, that's fine. but it's coming out of your pocket. to bring it back to the beginning, this is why investors don't like spending a ton of money on lobbying. it's a waste of resources to vote for carbon taxes, and also pay a ceo to lobby the government against carbon taxes. this is why exxon mobil's executives/board lost a battle with an environmental activist/hedge fund known as engine no. 1.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/exxon-mobil-engine-no-1-board.html

the last point i'll make about this is that if you're a citizen who is only using your power as a voter, you're not using all your other powers to enact the change you want in the world. most people on reddit are afraid of or angry at hedge funds, for example. but some people recognize how simple it is to form their own hedge fund and ""lobby"" corporations. some people look at a corrupt government and want to destroy the government. others figure out out how to take over and improve the government. you need to use all your hats/powers if you want to have real influence in the world. it's hard/expensive to outspend corporate lobbying. it's less hard/expensive to oust out a ceo, and limit/change corporate lobbying.",2.0,,McKoijion,0.0,False,False,Positive

lastly, if you can't handle squeeze stocks then don't trade them. i give many plays that are non-squeeze stocks, and to be factual i've given more non-squeeze setups than non-squeeze for the past 3 months. additionally, i already wrote multiple risk management guides on both twitter and discord, and people still manage to make a winning trade go red.

and if you were in my private twitter and discord, sorry to see you go. if you had a bad experience then i apologize. there was plenty of opportunities to make money. i am profitable in both bull and bear markets and my followers know that. doesn't matter what stock i trade too, small cap or large cap, etfs, etc, the track record is there. there is no point in spreading false fud like this when most people have banked on my ideas. this is why i avoid drama, we are only here to make money. many people were upset that i made profit on $tsla because they said it was ""too overpriced or whatever"" and they unfollowed me because they were short and i was long, and i ended up being right. it's drama like that i don't give a fuck about, i'm only here to make money so yes i will purge the idiots that will blame a winning trade on me. i keep discussion to stocks only now, none of this drama stuff because there's no point. anyways, have a good day",0.0,,caddude42069,0.0,False,False,Positive

1658596529,"\&gt;the recent ruling on new york rifle and pistol association v. bruen is a case where a majority conservative scotus made a great ruling, and not necessarily because guns

i have no ideas how this constitutionally recognized right will benefit the country, other than making this country as sh&amp;thole, nothing less than a battlefield in today's ukraine, where more than 100 persons die or injured per each day.

thank you for scotus to benefit this country, we should be grateful. 

\&gt; the epa ruling that more or less ended chevron deference doctrine is another case where a majority conservative scotus benefited this country fantastically, 

again thank you for scotus for americans population to suffer in this hot weather and ending up with spending more money to energy bills. the current climate change will give painful lesson to america's environment as well as population. especially climate change will give severe economic and societal changes to rural america, where r is voting them anyway, so i would let them simply suffer. good luck. the karma is on you, conservative.

1659526583,"tldr: there is accounting stupid things that make it look weird, in part. however, i cannot find data on how much they do award in # shares for compensation.

for what it‚Äôs worth, i asked investor relations last qtr about shares to get my dilution metrics right. here‚Äôs a few snippets:

‚Äúthe main reason for the diluted share count increase is that accounting rules require us to use a formulaic accounting method to calculate the warrants that are considered ‚Äúin the money‚Äù and add them to the basic share count.  as the share price increases, more of the ~115 mm outstanding warrants are included in the diluted share count.  the average share price for 1q22 was ~$44 which translated to ~58 mm shares being added to the diluted share count.  here‚Äôs the math of how it was calculated in 1q (($44-$22)/$44*115,142,723) = 57.9 mm.  so as long as warrants remain outstanding and ‚Äúin the money‚Äù we will have to apply this methodology for calculating the diluted share count.‚Äù

in essence, as the share price increases, the stupid formula counts more (but not all) of the oxt-wt $22 strike warrants. 

same formula would apply to berkshire warrants. here‚Äôs a hypothetical of how it‚Äôs have worked at q1 end if share price had averaged $100 in that quarter:

‚Äúoxy stock price: $100

common warrants: (($100-$22)/$100*115.1mm) = 89.8 mm

berkshire warrants: (($100-$59.62)/$100*83.9mm) = 33.9 mm

basic shares outstanding: 936.7 mm

diluted shares outstanding: 1,060.4 mm‚Äù


summary: there are accounting rules dictating how diluted is measured. do your own math. here‚Äôs my minimum dilution metric: ~930m outstanding + ~84m brk warrants + ~111.5m $22 strike warrants = ~1,125.5

missing pieces: what options are granted but not yet exercised from the past, and what the annual share-based comp is.

you can lend your eth on aave on the optimism layer 2. there you get 1% apy + 2.5% apy in $op tokens. then you borrow let's say usdt, effectively going long on eth (using leverage). current borrow interest rate is 3.4%, but you also get rewards in $op tokens at 1.6% rate. good job, now you are earning 1.6% a year for borrowing something, but be careful, you are leveraged...

now with that usdt you borrowed, you can naviguate through defi apps, like [yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance). these apps have vaults for particular tokens and yield farming techniques already implemented for them, everything is clear as water , just verify. currently the usdt has a brand new vault and apy isn't known, (expect an additionnal 2%). maybe you can also go on [curve.finance](https://curve.finance) and provide liquidity there at 1% apy + stake that pool token you will earn for about 7% apy in additional $curve rewards. or stake that into [convexfinance.com](https://convexfinance.com) pools to get about 16% apy in $cvx/$curve rewards..

to yield farm you need to do a lot of research and understand how defi apps works. it can also cost a lot in fees if you only do this with small amounts of crypto.. usually you want to chase new protocols that have liquidity mining rewards activated, effectively inflation of a token to attract liquidity and users. optimism is currently having many liquidity mining programs.. thats why yields are boosted on lets say aave. in the past bancor was giving up to 35% apy on usdt in $bnt tokens. it was pretty neat.. just gotta look around, find yields, borrow for less , and provide for more... it's easier in bull markets though. and you dont have to use leverage, this is just a bit more risky and fun imo",2.0,,99Thebigdady,0.0,False,False,Positive

1661179944,"as the pandemic set in, investors including warren buffett ditched shares of occidental petroleum corp. now, the oil-and-gas producer is the best-performing stock in the s&amp;p 500 this year, and a newfound favorite of the veteran investor.

more than two years after selling off its common shares of occidental, mr. buffett‚Äôs berkshire hathaway inc. is the company‚Äôs largest shareholder with about 20% of its stock, according to recent filings, and mr. buffett received regulatory approval friday to buy up to 50%.

buoyed by soaring commodity prices, occidental has substantially paid down its debt load and is generating cash. the company now looks like a strong fit for mr. buffett, say investors and analysts. it is strengthening its balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders; it holds the largest position in the most active u.s. oil field; and it is investing in technologies to reduce carbon emissions, which some of mr. buffett‚Äôs businesses are also doing.

‚Äúit checks off a lot of his boxes,‚Äù said steven check, chief investment officer of check capital management, which is invested in berkshire. ‚Äúit‚Äôs american, it has great cash flow and it‚Äôs a rational capital allocator.‚Äù

mr. buffett has publicly praised the strategy of occidental chief executive officer vicki hollub, and many analysts have speculated berkshire could buy the entire company. mr. buffett hasn‚Äôt informed occidental of any plans to acquire a controlling stake in the company and is unlikely to do so in the near-term, people familiar with the matter say.

‚Äúwhat vicki hollub was saying made nothing but sense,‚Äù mr. buffett said at berkshire‚Äôs recent annual shareholder meeting. ‚Äúand i decided that it was a good place to put berkshire‚Äôs money.‚Äù

under ms. hollub‚Äôs leadership, occidental has cut its debt load, repurchased shares and raised its dividends. like other companies, it has also been conservative about boosting production, despite oil prices rising.

that strategy is paying off. occidental generated a record $4.35 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter and $3.7 billion in profit. after its shares fell roughly 80% in 2020, occidental‚Äôs stock has jumped 146% this year, a rally driven, in part, by mr. buffett‚Äôs purchases.

the company still faces challenges. long-term doubts remain about demand for oil and gas as some countries shift to greener energy sources and some investors remain wary of the industry. occidental is also betting big on carbon capture, a technology whose profitability is unproven.

occidental entered the pandemic saddled with debt from a $38 billion deal to take over rival anadarko petroleum corp., part of which it funded with $10 billion from berkshire. plunging oil prices led the company to lay off employees and cut executives‚Äô salaries‚Äîincluding ms. hollub‚Äôs‚Äîand slash expenses in the oil patch.

but while the deal looked ill-timed, analysts say, the assets occidental acquired from anadarko have since helped solidify its position as the largest producer in the permian basin, the prolific shale oil field in west texas and new mexico. the company said it produced roughly half a million barrels of oil a day domestically in the second quarter of the year, compared with about 280,000 barrels before it acquired anadarko.

occidental has said it generates a profit when oil prices are as low as $40 a barrel. in the second quarter of the year, brent crude oil prices averaged $114.1 per barrel and u.s. crude prices averaged $109.9 per barrel, according to scotiabank.

all facts point to occidental being a play on domestic oil production for mr. buffett, said bill stone, chief investment officer of glenview trust, which held shares of both berkshire and occidental as of the end of the second quarter.

mr. buffett has also boosted his purchases of chevron corp. this year, making it berkshire‚Äôs fourth-largest holding.

occidental has said it aims to reach net-zero emissions on its operations and energy use by 2040. the company has invested in carbon removal through its oxy low carbon ventures and plans to develop the first industrial-scale plant to capture carbon dioxide from the air, which it says will require upward of $1 billion in investment.

the company‚Äôs focus on becoming a greener operator may inform mr. buffett‚Äôs appetite, analysts said. berkshire‚Äôs energy unit, berkshire hathaway energy, has stated a goal of retiring its coal units by 2049 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

occidental intends to develop 70 plants to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by 2035, it told investors in march. it has said it would invest between $100 million and $300 million through its low-carbon unit this year. investment bank truist securities said in a june note that more than 10% of occidental‚Äôs total business could come from its carbon capture division in a couple of years, up from less than 5% currently.

the $433 billion climate package president biden signed into law this month could accelerate the development of carbon-capture projects, industry experts say. the legislation raises the tax credit for direct air carbon capture and sequestration to $180 per metric ton from $50 previously.

the credits are helpful for carbon capture businesses, but some scientists say it is unrealistic to deploy the technology on a large scale because it needs huge amounts of energy, while some environmental groups say it could prolong fossil fuel consumption.

ms. hollub told investors earlier this month that the climate package was a good development for the company, pointing to the tax credits as one reason why ‚Äúthis is turning into for us a net very positive bill.‚Äù

mr. buffett has long been a buyer of oil and gas ventures, not always successfully. in 2008, he bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gas prices were near a peak, just before they fell.

‚Äúthe terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars,‚Äù mr. buffett wrote in the company‚Äôs 2008 annual report.

1661198357,"**business insider: warren buffett's occidental petroleum stake could sour like 2008 oil bet**

should investors follow warren buffett as his berkshire hathaway continues to build a stake in occidental petroleum? according to bank of america, the answer is ""no.""¬†

the bank reiterated its ""neutral"" view on occidental in a monday note to investors, setting an $80 price target, which represents potential upside of about 12% from current levels.¬†

""if [buffett's stake in] occidental petroleum is a bullish view [on oil prices] there are better options given its limited upside,"" bofa said.¬†

buffett already owns more than 20% of the company, has warrants to purchase even more of the stock, and was granted approval last week to purchase up to 50% of the company. while buffett hasn't expressed intent for a full takeover of the company by berkshire hathaway, that can change down the road.

but with limited upside in the stock, buffett risks bidding against himself for full control of the company, bofa said.

""berkshire hathaway's role as the 'rate of change' agent may have been overlooked but their disclosed interest may continue to squeeze short positions, recent outperformance may mean the risk from here is that berkshire hathaway ends up bidding against itself,"" bofa said.

the bank reminded investors that buffett's oil bets haven't always panned out well, including his purchase of conocophillips right before the 2008 stock market meltdown.¬†

""this would not be the first time berkshire hathaway has publicly made a call on oil prices: but its track record has not always worked out so well... we recall a time in the past when berkshire hathaway has very publicly taken a sizeable equity position as a tangible demonstration of a directional position on oil prices,"" bofa said.

in 2008, berkshire hathaway built a 5.5% stake in conocophillips before its stock price plummeted amid a crash in oil prices due to an economic slowdown.¬†

buffett conceded in his annual shareholder letter: ""...[l]ast year i made a major mistake... without urging from anyone else, i bought a large amount of conocophillips stock when oil and gras prices were near their peak. i in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred...i still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future... but so far i have been dead wrong,"" buffett said.

""our point is not to pick on berkshire hathaway's misfortunes around energy in 2008: it was certainly not alone. it is simply to point out that just because berkshire hathaway has chosen to step into occidental petroleum in 2022 does not necessarily imply some proprietary insight that can drive differential market recognition of value,"" bofa said.

ultimately, if an investor has the view that oil prices will continue to move higher, there are better oil stocks to invest in to express that view, according to bofa.

""while berkshire hathaway will no doubt continue to squeeze an elevated short position, we see better options to play that theme where there is still: rate of change, capacity for outsized cash returns with similar operating leverage and more meaningful value upside. otherwise at this point, we see the risk for berkshire that it is at risk of bidding against itself,"" bofa concluded.

&gt;according to the documents, the kurdistan region in iraq's (kri) oil output could rise to 580,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five year's time under a scenario in which investment is fully optimised, leaving 530,000 bpd available for export.  
&gt;  
&gt;but without new investment, the semi-autonomous region might only have 240,000 bpd available to export as older wells become depleted, the documents, which have not previously been reported, show.  
&gt;  
&gt;""it is very dangerous,"" said kri parliamentarian karwan gaznay, who is a member of the region's oil and gas committee.  
&gt;  
&gt;""we should be alarmed by it, but it will not be a real issue if we sort out our problems with the iraqi government, then kurdistan can develop new blocks and increase production. we have a lot of reservoirs,"" he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;the krg did not respond to a request for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;under the iraqi constitution, the region is entitled to a portion of the national budget. but the arrangement collapsed in 2014 when the kurds seized control of iraq's main northern oilfields in kirkuk from islamic state and began selling crude from there independently.  
&gt;  
&gt;in 2018, iraqi forces retook disputed territories, including the oil city of kirkuk, and baghdad resumed some budget payments but they have been sporadic. so far this year, it has sent two payments of 200 billion iraqi dinars ($137 million). natural decline  
&gt;  
&gt;krg's debt currently stands at about $38 billion, according to a government official, and lawmaker gaznay said oil exports accounted for 85% of the region's budget.  
&gt;  
&gt;the krg's financial position has improved this year thanks to surging oil prices following russia's invasion of ukraine but a steep decline in output would significantly increase its fiscal constraints.  
&gt;  
&gt;the region's oil output has already slipped from about 468,000 bpd in 2019 to 445,000 last year and 434,000 in the first quarter of 2022, according to reports by deloitte.  
&gt;  
&gt;""the reason that the current oil production is going down is due to the inability of the ministry of natural resources to bring timely additional investment online to overcome the natural decline of 15% to 20% each year in production for each well,"" a source in the krg said.  
&gt;  
&gt;the government documents said falls in output at three major oilfields - tawke, khurmala and taq taq - are the main reason for decline.  
&gt;  
&gt;the potential slide in the kurdish region's oil output makes it important for the government to boost gas production, but a project to expand one of the biggest fields in iraq has been suspended due to security concerns. read more  
&gt;  
&gt;the oil in the region comes from drilling into fractures in limestone rocks. this initially results in high yields, but aggressive levels of production can rapidly drain the fractures and lead to water flooding in, energy experts said.  
&gt;  
&gt;rising water levels in several fields, including taq taq, have made it harder to access the oil, according to a government official and energy experts, who put the rapid depletion of the wells down to bad management and the challenging geology.  
&gt;  
&gt;energy experts and industry sources say attracting more investment could save the region from sliding into insolvency, but the difficult investment climate is getting in the way.  
&gt;  
&gt;""there is some field expansions, which are slow. companies are finding it hard to get approvals and there haven't been significant new discoveries for several years now,"" said robin mills, chief executive of consultancy qamar energy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""without big new developments they risk going into decline in the near future,"" he said. oil sector setbacks  
&gt;  
&gt;the kurdish region has proven oil reserves of less than 3 billion barrels at most, based on the most optimistic forecast, according to the krg source, only a tiny fraction of iraq's overall proven reserves of more than 140 billion barrels.  
&gt;  
&gt;and the region's energy sector has faced a number of recent setbacks.  
&gt;  
&gt;an iraqi federal supreme court ruling in february deemed the legal foundations of the oil and gas sector in the region to be unconstitutional, forcing some foreign firms, including u.s. oilfield services companies schlumberger (slb.n), baker hughes (bkr.o) and halliburton (hal.n), to leave read more  
&gt;  
&gt;the upcoming decision in an arbitration case dating back to 2014 between turkey and iraq about the oil export pipeline that runs between the two countries is also sending ripples of uncertainty through foreign firms still in the kurdish region.  
&gt;  
&gt;iraq claims turkey has violated an agreement by giving the kurdish region access to the pipeline without baghdad's approval.  
&gt;  
&gt;the final hearing at the international chamber of commerce in paris was in july and there will be a final decision in the next few months, according to iraq's oil ministry and sources familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;foreign oil investors first came to kurdistan in the era of former iraqi president saddam hussein, when the region was considered more stable and secure than the rest of iraq.  
&gt;  
&gt;but the region's star has started to fade, with the big foreign firms deterred by tensions between the region and the central government in iraq, a string of downgrades to iraqi kurdistan's oil reserves and security problems.  
&gt;  
&gt;now kurdistan only has a handful of small and medium-sized operators, many of which complain about the difficult operating environment. if the investment environment does not improve kurdistan risks further withdrawals.

*earlier in 2022, devon energy marked a new chapter with a pivot towards dividends, which thus far has been very profitable for their shareholders.
unsurprisingly, the first half of 2022 saw extremely strong free cash flow on the back of booming oil and gas prices.
they have followed this cash windfall with an acquisition spree, recently announcing two additions.
this helps lift their free cash flow and thus dividend outlook relatively higher and thus helps offset a degree of the downside if oil prices keep softening.
as this does not levy too great of a cost upon their financial position, it creates a rare win-win for their shareholders and thus i believe that maintaining my buy rating is appropriate*

1663685323,"warren buffett's berkshire hathaway made a $2 billion misstep by selling its occidental petroleum stock in 2020, a markets insider analysis of securities and exchange commission filings shows.

the famed investor's conglomerate has spent about $10 billion to purchase 188 million occidental shares this year, giving it a 20.2% stake in the oil-and-gas explorer and producer.

however, it could have saved a fortune by hanging onto a previous holding of occidental shares, instead of dumping it in 2020 then rebuilding it at triple the price in recent months.

berkshire paid an estimated $810 million to buy 18.9 million common shares of occidental in the second half of 2019, based on the energy company's average closing stock price in the period.

buffett's company received another 28.8 million shares in 2020, after occidental opted to pay $400 million of preferred-stock dividends to berkshire in the form of common stock instead of cash. occidental owed the dividends as part of a $10 billion financing deal it struck with berkshire in 2019, and wanted to preserve its cash reserves.

berkshire sold its entire position of nearly 48 million occidental shares for about $720 million during the second and third quarters of 2020. if the conglomerate had retained those shares, they would have quadrupled in value to $3.1 billion as of monday's close.

occidental's stock price has doubled this year alone, to about $65, as russia's invasion of ukraine continues to disrupt global energy supplies and drive fuel prices higher.

berkshire's occidental stock purchases this year mean it has effectively rebought the shares it sold for about $2.5 billion ‚Äî three times what it laid out in 2019.

it has paid a weighted average price of $53 per share to build its stake this year, or more than triple occidental's average closing price of $15 during the two quarters when berkshire sold in 2020.

of course, buffett and his team couldn't have known oil prices would surge within two years of their occidental exit, revitalizing the company's prospects. still, they lost out on nearly $2 billion in profits by selling their occidental stake in 2020, and ended up spending an extra $1.7 billion to rebuild it this year.

1664552404,"summary

* warren buffett's berkshire hathaway has been buying occidental petroleum stock all year long.
* he has bought it at relative highs as well as lows.
* most recently, he revealed in a filing that he had purchased an additional 6 million shares.
* in this article, i explain why buffett is likely correct about oxy being a good value.

recently berkshire hathaway (brk.b) (brk.a) disclosed that warren buffett had bought another 5.99 million shares in occidental petroleum (nyse:oxy), following earlier buys. reuters reported that the shares cost $352 million, implying an average cost of $58.76. thanks to falling oil prices, oxy fell well below its average price for the year, and buffett jumped on the opportunity.

this year, oil stocks like oxy have been pretty tightly correlated with the price of oil. it's natural to an extent, because the higher oil prices go, the more money oil companies make. however, traders seem to be underestimating the kinds of profits oil companies will generate even with oil just at $80. this year, oil companies have been reducing their debt, which makes more profit possible leaving revenue unchanged. occidental petroleum, for its part, retired $8 billion in debt by may, with more payments having occurred in subsequent months.

so, it appears likely that oxy will beat on earnings in its next few releases. based on its trading behavior, it is simply moving with the price of oil - investors seem to be ignoring the possibility of improved profits due to lower costs. debt creates interest expenses, sometimes a lot of them. for example, if you finance $8 billion at 5% interest, you get $400 million in annual recurring costs. a company that knocks out that much expense can grow even if the commodity it's selling is just staying flat.

given all of these factors, it looks like occidental petroleum is still a good value. at least, for those with very long time horizons and realistic return expectations. at this point it's pretty clear that pie-eyed fantasies about wti crude going to $380 aren't coming true, but there are enough economic factors working in its favor that oil should hold above $70. that alone should be enough for oxy to be worth more than today's stock price.

why i expect oil to hold above $70

as i wrote earlier, occidental petroleum doesn't need oil at $100, $120 or $380 to grow. with the massive amount of debt it's retiring, it should be able to eke out strong earnings growth even at today's prices. with that being said, it won't thrive if oil falls dramatically, so i should outline briefly why i expect oil to hold at least $70.

we can start by looking at supply.

the supply of oil has been held back by the conflict in ukraine, and that shows no signs of ending any time soon. after ukraine made some territorial gains, russia responded by mobilizing (i.e. drafting) russian men with fighting experience. now, russia claims that it has up to 1 million soldiers at its disposal. ukraine had achieved some impressive wins with the advanced u.s. weaponry it was given, but now it has to contend with a larger number of russian soldiers. so, the conflict in ukraine looks likely to drag on for a while.

the war in ukraine pushed oil prices higher this year by curtailing russian exports. initially, western sanctions caused russian oil output to plummet, which caused prices to rise. russian oil output later recovered. however, russia is mainly selling oil to markets like india, it's still under sanctions from western nations, so the supply it's moving is ""geographically locked."" this means it's not truly part of the ""world market,"" leaving upward pressure on prices.

the second factor influencing oil supply this year is strategic petroleum reserve (""spr"") releases. the u.s. and other countries have been releasing oil from their reserves. the u.s., for example, is selling a million barrels a day. that's offsetting the loss of russian oil exports, but it's set to end soon. originally, the release was supposed to end in october, but it was extended to november. however, the november release is down to 10 million barrels, so the selling is being wound down. as the selloff grinds to a halt, the supply will go down, putting upward pressure on the price.

finally, we have the fact that opec is consistently missing its production targets. in the early days of the oil rally, lowering prices was a big priority for the biden administration. at one point, biden travelled to saudi arabia to try to get the country to sell more oil. the saudis agreed to hike oil output by 100,000 barrels a day, but it didn't matter, because they and other opec countries missed their production targets. today, opec is still missing targets and mulling output cuts too. so, that's more supply that will leave the market shortly.

there's also the matter of demand. this year, gasoline consumption is up from the same time in 2021. it's currently down from the summer peak, but still rising on a year-over-year basis. consumption of jet fuel is also rising, thanks to the end of covid-19 lockdowns in most western countries. taking all of these factors together-low supply and high demand-and you get a recipe for continued strength in oil prices. i can't say that we're going to rally over $100 again, but $70 seems like a reasonable support level, as that's where oil was at for most of 2021.

(continued)",5.0,,100_PERCENT_BRKB,0.0,False,False,Positive
1664552415,"how oxy benefits

occidental petroleum benefits from rising oil prices more than other energy companies do, for two reasons:

* it does not have significant refining operations.
* it is paying off its debt.

refining operations experience lower margins when oil prices rise. first, many refineries purchase crude oil with intent to sell it after refining it, and it gets more expensive to buy the input when prices go up. second, oil refining is itself energy intensive, often using natural gas (whose price is positively correlated with crude oil) as a power source. of course, refineries sell for higher prices when oil prices rise so, like any oil and gas operation, their revenue rises. their margins however tend to fall. that tends to curb the profits of oil companies that have refinery operations, but occidental petroleum has none.

second, occidental petroleum is paying off its debt at a rapid pace this year. it had paid off $8 billion worth by may, and is aiming to do more. in november, oxy will be releasing its earnings for the third quarter. the release will not only show all the revenue and earnings numbers investors are looking for, but also the amount of debt repayment. the level of debt is arguably more important than trailing earnings, because it shows how much interest expense the company will shave off its profit and loss statement. because oil prices fell in the third quarter, we'd expect oxy's debt reduction to slow down. however, it is still possible for oxy to produce high profits at today's oil prices, as it breaks even at less than $40.

occidental petroleum valuation

having looked at oxy's macro and debt picture, we can turn to its valuation. according to seeking alpha quant, oxy is a very cheap stock, trading at the following multiples:

* 8 times adjusted earnings.
* 6 times gaap earnings.
* 1.7 times sales.
* 3 times book value.
* 3.9 times operating cash flow.

these are all low multiples for the stock market as a whole (for reference, the s&amp;p 500 p/e ratio is currently about 18.5). additionally, oxy is cheap in a discounted cash flow model. if you take oxy's free cash flow per share ($12.12) and divide it by a discount rate, you get the terminal value estimates shown in the table below:

* 6%: $202
* 8%: $151
* 10%: $121
* 12%: $101

as you can see, occidental petroleum is worth more than its current stock price even if you assume no growth. the table above is just a series of terminal value estimates, no ""growth period"" is assumed. additionally, all the discount rates used are way above the current 10 year treasury yield. so, if oxy can simply maintain the prior year's cash flow levels, it's worth more than it currently costs.

one big risk to watch out for

as we've seen in the preceding paragraphs, warren buffett has every reason to be excited about the opportunity in occidental petroleum stock. oil prices are likely to stay high, and occidental petroleum is paying off debt at a furious pace. what's not to love?

as of today, not much: oxy is a great stock.

however, there is one major risk for investors to watch out for:

oil dropping below $40.

oxy's break even wti crude price has been estimated at just slightly below $40. therefore, oxy is barely profitable when oil moves to $40, and likely unprofitable at $35. as i showed in the section on oil price economics, prices are quite unlikely to go that low. oil supply is headed down this year, while demand is modestly up. nevertheless, investors are going to have a bad time if prices go significantly lower. if they go below $70, stock market traders are likely to begin selling oxy; if they go below $40, the fundamentals will also take a hit.

so, remember to stay safe out there. occidental petroleum has a bigger margin of safety than the average stock, but it's not risk-free.

you concede they‚Äôre making record profits but you ‚Äúdisagree with most of that opinion?‚Äù not following.

you keep posting that map despite the fact that it proves nothing in and of itself. the west is an anomaly because our pipelines are relatively isolated from the rest of the network. this makes us more sensitive to refinery slowdowns. sure, you could parrot ‚Äúdrill baby drill‚Äù and ‚Äújust build more refineries‚Äù as an easy solution, but to what end? are 20 refineries enough? 50? 100? should we just litter huntington beach in oil derricks again like it‚Äôs the 1930s, because heaven forbid we regulate fuel production or crude extraction?

&gt;moscow/houston, oct 7 (reuters) - russian president vladimir putin has signed a decree, published on friday, to set up a new operator for the sakhalin 1 oil and gas project, following similar steps to seize other oil and gas projects with foreign participation.

&gt;exxon mobil corp (xom.n), with a 30% stake, was the operator of sakhalin-1, a development in russia's far east. the largest u.s. producer has been trying to exit russia operations since march, days after moscow's invasion of ukraine. exxon declined to comment on friday's decree.

&gt;in april, exxon took a $4.6 billion impairment charge for exiting its russian activities, leaving sakhalin-1 operation open for a takeover from a partner. it also proceeded to reduce oil and gas production volumes and remove personnel from the country.

&gt;in august, putin issued the presidential decree 520 which exxon said impedes the company to conclude the exit safely. the producer then escalated the dispute and issued a note of difference that could ultimately end up in an arbitration process.

1665466062,"## india will weigh what russia has to offer on sakhalin-1 ownership revamp

by marianna parraga and gary mcwilliams

houston, oct 10 (reuters) - india maintains a ""healthy dialogue"" with russia and will look at what is offered following an announced ownership revamp to the sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, petroleum minister hardeep singh puri told reuters.

russia last week [issued a decree allowing it to seize exxon mobil's 30% stake ](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-setting-up-new-operator-sakhalin-1-tass-2022-10-07/) and gave a russian state-run company the authority to decide whether foreign shareholders including india's ongc videsh (onvi.ns) can retain their participation in the project.

""we‚Äôll look at what is the state of play and what‚Äôs on offer,"" petroleum minister hardeep singh puri told reuters in an interview on monday following meetings with u.s. oil executives in houston.

india is ""actively monitoring"" saudi arabia's asia premium over oil prices after opec+ last week agreed to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day beginning next month, puri said.

""at the end of the day, consumers start playing a role when situations like this evolve,‚Äù he said referring to global energy balance and the ""unintended consequences"" of the opec+ decision. too high oil prices could exacerbate inflation and tip the global economy in recession, reducing oil demand, he added.

on the proposed european union price cap on russian oil purchases, he suggested it is not yet firm. ‚Äúif the europeans come with a plan, let‚Äôs see how it evolves,"" he said.

puri this week met u.s. energy secretary jennifer granholm and energy security adviser amos hochstein in washington, where they discussed collaborations on biofuels and clean energy in addition to energy security.

""at no stage have we ever been told not to buy russian oil,"" he said, referring to talks with officials on global energy supplies.

in houston, he met executives from exxon mobil (xom.n), oilfield service provider baker hughes (bkr.o), and with liquefied natural gas producers after launching a bidding round for offshore oil and gas exploration areas.

india is interested in the u.s companies' technical expertise in offshore production, ethanol and sulfur recovery in oil refineries, puri added.

""for getting to green energy, you have to survive the present,"" he said.

there are also discussions underway with guyana, brazil and colombia for joint investment and extra supplies of crude for indian refiners, he said.",5.0,,FuhrerIsCringe,0.0,True,False,Positive

tbh its likely some government intervention as well. the opec decision last week and higher than expected cpi figures should have had a far larger impact. throw on top expected increases in official interest rates for the next year or two and the markets should be tumbling faster than expected.

growth stocks are going to be hard to continue their meteoric gains of the last 2.5 years.
any shipping related activities are going to get more expensive - so retail will struggle with higher costs and lower revenue.

only the oil industry will benefit in the near term. look at $xom - pumped from mid to high 80's to over 100 a share since the opec announcement.

*however, we urge investors not to buy into such rhetoric, as the actual reduction could be much less. furthermore, street analysts have yet to factor in a global recession.
we explain why oxy remains ominously perched, with a steeper decline looking increasingly likely. we also discuss why wall street is still too optimistic, heading into a recession.*

*hence, we urge investors to use the recent rally to cut more exposure and let the overly-optimistic buyers take their shares from them at the current levels.

1666646067,"and some good news for oil and gas investors from schlumberger's ceo, olivier le peuch.  after beating on both lines, he had this to say about the state of oil field services going forward:

*turning now to the macro. we have strengthened our view in a multiyear upcycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth. despite concerns over the slowdown of global growth rates and the potential for recession, the fundamentals for energy as a critical resource remain very constructive.*  


* *first, in the near term, a seasonal uptick in demand as winter approaches is pitted against a very intricate supply landscape for both oil and gas through the end of the year. this situation is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crisis in europe. looking further out into the horizon, the demand-supply picture remains delicate, with this imbalance amplified by geopolitics, increased instances of supply disruptions and limited spare global capacity.*
* *second, the growing necessity of energy security and supply-source diversification will also bring -- also drive urgent increases in energy investment. a significant step-up in investment is required to create supply redundancies, rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth.*
* *and third, recent opec+ decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation -- operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions. taken together, these dynamics will result in a supply-led upcycle characterized by resilient upstream investment that is decoupled from near-term demand volatility.*  


*we expect investment growth will be durable, reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory, multi-year capacity expansion plans, lower operating breakeven prices and supportive commodity prices. growth will be simultaneous in north america and in the international markets. this started first in the north america market, and we are already witnessing the next phase of growth with an acceleration in pace in the offshore and international markets that was very visible in the third quarter.*

&gt;""the sakhalin-1 is extremely important for japan's energy security as it is a valuable source outside of the middle east,"" industry minister yasutoshi nishimura told a news conference, citing that japan was highly dependent on middle east crude oil.

&gt;""japanese government has decided to keep its stakes in the project,"" he said, adding he met executives of sakhalin oil and gas development co (sodeco), a consortium of japanese firms holding 30% stake in the formerly exxon-led project, on monday and urged them to consider joining the new russian entity.

&gt;russian president vladimir putin last month issued a decree to establish a new operator for the formerly exxon mobil-led project, authorising the kremlin to decide whether foreign shareholders could retain stakes in sakhalin-1. exxon (xom.n) fully exited russia after moscow ""unilaterally terminated"" its interests in the project.",2.0,,chakokat,0.0,True,False,Positive

1667668239,"excellent reflections from u/gfp, my favorite user of the cobf forum: 

q3 results are out.  another quarter with only $1b in repurchases will disappoint some.  insurance float up $3b to $150 billion (will rise by $13.5 billion to $163.5 with alleghany included).  geico had $600 million of losses from hurricane ian but the biggest problem for geico is that customers are leaving when it increases rates, and it isn't even increasing rates as much as it needs to.  geico has now been putting up underwriting losses steadily and has slashed advertising and expense ratio.  berkshire reinsurance only had $1.9 billion in ian losses - a very good result showing that berkshire has really pulled back from cat reinsurance.  companywide, ian was a $3.4 billion pretax, $2.7 billion after tax loss.  brk's q3 effective tax rate is over 37% - a short term blip but i guess they can stop writing articles about how brk will be the biggest loser from the 15% minimum tax on book profit bill.

 

oxy will be equity method accounted but with a one quarter lag, so q4 will include a partial q3's worth of oxy earnings.  no oxy earnings included in this release.  gains on oxy stock are not going to increase our book value going forward, similar to kraft (if kraft ever had gains..).  the oxy warrants will still be marked to market (or more accurately 'marked to model') each quarter, so those gains will show up.

 

looks like berkshire didn't change the apple holdings and purchased an additional $880m-ish worth of chevron stock.  berkshire sold $4.7 billion of cost basis holdings from the banks, insurance &amp; finance category in the quarter.  it wasn't bac or axp obviously.

 

berkshire's equity put derivatives are almost completely behind us.  berkshire's corporate borrowings are a thing of beauty with the foreign currency borrowings all looking like yet another version of negative cost float over their lifetimes.

* it's tempting to think that occidental petroleum stock is getting overheated, but it's still ""cheap"" in valuation terms.
* i've been holding occidental petroleum since $55 and i wouldn't exit anywhere lower than $80.
* the u.s. spr release will probably end after the midterms.
* we could see gains in oil prices and in oil stocks like occidental petroleum if that happens.

occidental petroleum corporation (nyse:oxy) just released its third quarter earnings. the release showed a large beat on gaap earnings and a very slight miss on normalized earnings. the release exceeded expectations overall, as oxy received many downgrades during the third quarter, which saw oil prices fall.

oxy has been one of this year‚Äôs best performing oil stocks. up 144% for the year, it is outperforming the oil sector, which is really saying something because oil is outperforming every other sector this year.

oxy has a number of advantages over other oil companies. these advantages are taking its price higher. for one thing, it has the blessing of warren buffett, who owns so much oxy he‚Äôs now accounting for it through the equity method. news that buffett owns a stock has been known to move markets, and he has bought enough oxy at this point (over 20%) that he is supporting the price by making the float smaller.

for another thing, oxy got beaten down so badly in the 2020 oil bear market that high growth from the weak base period was pretty easy to achieve. in 2020, oxy ran a truly staggering $17 per share loss. it also had an enormous pile of debt. when you‚Äôve got that kind of weakness in your past history, it‚Äôs not hard to look better in the future. so, it‚Äôs not surprising that oxy is now rising faster than other oil companies. it‚Äôs paying off debt and generally getting rid of the things that made it such a catastrophe two and a half years ago. as we saw in oxy‚Äôs third quarter release, that's paying off. that bodes well for the company‚Äôs future earnings.

it‚Äôs natural at this stage in the game to worry that oxy‚Äôs rally is getting long in the tooth. personally, i think the low hanging fruit has been picked; the stock may not be a ‚Äúmulti-bagger‚Äù from these levels. it does, however, have a valuation that suggests long term upside even if you assume that oil prices fall a bit from today‚Äôs levels. for this reason i consider oxy a moderate buy; a basically above-average stock, though not the mind-blowing opportunity it once was.

occidental petroleum - earnings recap

occidental petroleum‚Äôs recent earnings release was better than expected. in the release, the company revealed:

* $2.52 in diluted gaap eps, a significant beat (the estimate was for $2.41).
* $4.3 billion in cash from continuing operations.
* $3.6 billion in free cash flow.
* $1.8 billion in debt repayment.
* $1.8 billion in buybacks.

it was a pretty decent showing all around. the earnings were pretty decent, and the continued debt repayment points to a path to improved profitability in the future. the lower your debt, the lower your interest expense, which can result in a profit jump in later periods even if oil prices only stay flat. it‚Äôs very hard to say where oil prices will head from today‚Äôs level. the end of the spr release and opec production cuts point to lower supply and higher prices, but the fed‚Äôs continued rate hiking may reduce demand. so, occidental‚Äôs debt reduction bodes well. it‚Äôs not clear that oil prices will keep rising forever, and oxy has taken steps to ensure profitability despite that.

why oxy did so well this year

as we saw earlier today, oxy‚Äôs latest earnings release was pretty strong. the release was only one of several good ones from the company this year, and companies putting out impressive earnings tend to see their stock prices appreciate. however, that doesn‚Äôt explain why oxy has done so much better than other oil companies. the vast majority of oil companies have been growing this year, and xle (the energy sector etf) is up 63%. so, why is oxy doing so much better than its peers?

setting aside speculation about a possible buyout by berkshire hathaway (brk.a, brk.b), one factor driving oxy‚Äôs returns is the sheer weakness in the company‚Äôs base period. in its 2020 annual report, oxy reported a staggering $17 per share loss, and $35 billion in debt. the debt was nearly double shareholders' equity at the time, and nearly ten times operating cash flows. it was a pretty scary situation, which is why buffett initially invested in oxy through preferred stock and warrants rather than common stock. but later, oil prices rallied to extreme highs and oxy paid off a lot of its debt. in the second quarter, it was able to grow its earnings by $3.6 billion year-over-year.

so, oxy‚Äôs stock price rose faster than other oil stocks because of weakness in the base period. in economics, there is a concept called ‚Äúbase effects,‚Äù which says that inflation is likely to be slower after a fast growth period and vice versa. the same concept applies to corporate earnings. a company that starts at $10 in earnings and grows to $11 in earnings, grows at 10%. a company that starts at $10 in earnings and grows to $12, grows at 20%. both companies end up with $12 in earnings, but the latter one grows faster. if it‚Äôs publicly listed, its stock price probably goes up faster too.

&gt; 
&gt; a bit of extra context: before the sanctions were imposed, the joint-ventures between chevron and pdvsa, the venezuelan state-owned oil company, pumped about 200,000 b/d. so that's probably as much extra crude as we can expect -- and that will require time, money and expertise
&gt; 
&gt; another interesting tidbit of the ‚Äúgeneral license‚Äù that washington gave today to chevron: it only allows $cvx to export the crude oil it pumps in venezuela into the united states (and nowhere else). #oott

some of this was already potentially in the works, but its likely been spurred forward as a policy, [given saudi arabia cutting production right before the midterms to help republicans and help the russians](https://theintercept.com/2022/10/20/saudi-oil-production-cut/). a more diversified set of oil producers lessens the shock that any one producer can have. 

and also spurred on by [florida turning so far right.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/us/elections/results-florida.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=article&amp;state=default&amp;module=election-results&amp;context=election_recirc&amp;region=statenavmenu) 

when florida was a competitive state, tailoring foreign policy to the emigre communities of cubans, venezuelans and others was a big concern to win florida's seats and ec votes. but with florida now a safe republican state, and those emigres siding strongly with republicans, democratic politicians can now develop a foreign policy based on the best interest, not winning votes.

maximum pressure tactics against cuba and venezuela clearly don't actually work. it doesn't lead to a regime change, it just punishes the people. so it's a very good sign that biden is taking this step.

[by jonathan stempel](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/buffetts-berkshire-discloses-big-taiwan-semi-stake-2022-11-14/)

  
nov 14 (reuters) - berkshire hathaway inc (brka.n) said it bought more than $4.1 billion of stock in taiwan semiconductor manufacturing (2330.tw), , a rare significant foray into the technology sector by billionaire warren buffett's conglomerate.  
the news sent shares in tsmc soaring, closing up 7.9% in taiwan on tuesday, as it boosted investor sentiment for the world's largest contract chipmaker, which saw its shares hit a two-year low last month due to a sharp slowdown in global chip demand.

tsmc's other foreign investors include u.s. asset managers blackrock inc (blk.n) and vanguard group inc, and singapore sovereign wealth fund gic (gic.ul).  
berkshire also disclosed new stakes of $297 million in building materials company louisiana-pacific corp (lpx.n) and $13 million in jefferies financial group inc (jef.n). it exited an investment in store capital corp (stor.n), a real estate company that agreed in september to be taken private.  
the filing did not specify whether buffett or his portfolio managers todd combs and ted weschler made specific purchases and sales. investors often try to piggy back on what berkshire buys. larger investments are normally buffett's.  
while berkshire does not normally make big technology bets, it often prefers companies it perceives to have competitive advantages, often through their size.  
tsmc, which makes chips for the likes of apple inc (aapl.o), qulacomm (qcom.o) and nvidia corp (nvda.o), posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit last month, but struck a more cautious note than usual on upcoming demand.

""i suspect berkshire has a belief that the world cannot do without the products manufactured by taiwan semi,"" said tom russo, a partner at gardner, russo &amp; quinn in lancaster, pennsylvania, which owns berkshire shares.  
""only a small number of companies that can amass the capital to deliver semiconductors, which are increasingly central to people's lives,"" he added.  
berkshire has had mixed success in technology.  
its more than six-year wager during the last decade in ibm corp (ibm.n) did not pan out, but berkshire is sitting on huge unrealized gains on its $126.5 billion stake in apple, which buffett views more as a consumer products company.  
apple is by far the largest investment in berkshire's $306.2 billion equity portfolio.  
berkshire disclosed the tsmc stake about 2-1/2 months after it began reducing a decade-old, multi-billion dollar stake in byd co (002594.sz), china's largest electric car company.  
in the third quarter, berkshire added to its stakes in chevron corp (cvx.n), occidental petroleum corp (oxy.n), celanese corp (ce.n), paramount global (para.o) and rh (rh.n).  
it also sold shares of activision blizzard inc (atvi.o), bank of new york mellon corp (bk.n), general motors co (gm.n), kroger co (kr.n) and us bancorp (usb.n).  
buffett, 92, has run berkshire since 1965. the omaha, nebraska-based company also owns dozens of businesses such as the bnsf railroad, the geico auto insurer, several energy and industrial companies, fruit of the loom and dairy queen.",1.0,,JeebusBuiltMyHotRod,0.0,False,False,Positive

trading thesis : tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials  helps to narrow down moving tickers  
fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.   
i look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less that 500 million.   
the shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used ( or shares traded). that information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.   
things to consider when finding the plays-   
\* if the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, i will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.   
\* if the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, i would consider it for a long play. if trading less than the movement of the ticker, i would consider a short or put play.  ( if all the other factors previously mentioned checks out. )   
\* the trades are researched afternoon daily  to find possible tickers making a big move.",3.0,,Badboyardie,0.0,False,False,Positive

it‚Äôs all a fugazi, if someone‚Äôs losing in one corner there‚Äôs going to be someone winning in the other, you just have to fluctuate and focus on where the money is going and how much potential does that company have‚Ä¶ buy low sell high‚Ä¶ unfortunately for tsla ‚Äúbag holders‚Äù elon convinced most of his followers/fans (who think they experts on ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù) plung a shit ton of money into overvalued shares and now they‚Äôre stuck and reluctant to sell‚Ä¶ he probably had keen idea of the future dip and just baited morons to buy into an overvalued company‚Ä¶ and now they all get defensive about tsla

as traders you shouldn‚Äôt be defending a company or its reputation, you should simply focus on the potential outs, of buy low and sell high, not buy when a rich asshole tweets to buy‚Ä¶ as traders we have no obligation or any loyalty to any company we invest in. we should simply rely on the idea and strategy of receiving the best outputs of our money‚Ä¶ and defending controversial ceo‚Äôs is just idiotic, they don‚Äôt know us (general public) nor do they give or ever will 2 shits about us",11.0,,Particular-Ad-3411,0.0,False,False,Positive
